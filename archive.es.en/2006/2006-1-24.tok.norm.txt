it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

" at this stage of the investigations , there is no formal , irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret cia detention centers in romania , poland or any other country , " he wrote . were eu governments in the know ? the eu probe comes in the wake of an explosive report published in us daily the washington post last november , alleging the existence of a network of secret jails operated by the cia in europe and covertly flying prisoners though airports on the continent in cia planes . the us government has neither denied nor confirmed the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss military intelligence is said to have intercepted a fax confirming the existence of secret cia prisons marty on tuesday also alleged that european governments , or at least their intelligence services , were almost certainly aware of the rendition " affecting europe " of more than a hundred persons in recent years . " hundreds of cia-chartered flights have passed through numerous european countries , " marty noted , adding that certain revelations had already been published in the media . " it has been proved and in fact never denied that individuals have been abducted , deprived of their liberty and transported in europe , to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered torture , " the swiss lawmaker said in a press release . marty pointed out that the us secretary of state condoleeza rice , in a december speech to europeans , did not at any point deny that the so called " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects to third countries was taking place . but he stopped just short of accusing the united states of lying outright in noting that " the only thing that rice categorically denied was torture . " tuesday 's statements in strasbourg were n't exactly a surprise given that marty had already indicated earlier where his preliminary investigations were leading . earlier this month he accused eu leaders of " shocking " passivity , arguing they were aware of the cia activities for at least two to three years . " there are countries that have collaborated actively , and there are others who have tolerated .
others have simply looked the other way , " marty said . ramifications unknown it remains unclear what the fallout of the probe will be .
the council of europe investigation coincides with a european parliament temporary committee set up last week to probe cia activities in european airspace and territory . the committee has plans to summon high-ranking politicians and intelligence officials in brussels during spring . but some have doubts whether that will happen . " intelligence will not go to their national parliaments for hearings , so there is little chance that they will come to brussels , " british conservative mep charles tannock , a member of the committee , told euobserver . " i doubt it seriously that european defense ministers will willingly come to brussels to be cross-examined by the european parliament .

monday 's bilateral came at a sensitive time for franco-german relations , with the two governments struggling to reignite their historic sense of purpose at the heart of the eu , commentators said . french prime minister dominique de villepin and foreign minister philippe douste-blazy have both been to berlin in the last two weeks in a bid to boost the partnership . but with merkel at the very start of her term in office and chirac nearing the end of his , " europe may not get any of the decisions it needs till after the french presidential elections " in spring 2007 , said sylvie goulard of the centre for international research -lrb- ceri -rrb- in paris . divided on next step for eu constitution considerable uncertainty hangs over the fate of the eu constitutional treaty which was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands last year but approved by the german parliament and 12 other countries . sources close to the elysee said that while france would be willing to preserve parts of the text and discard others , merkel 's view was that the constitution should not be broken up piecemeal . another source of potential discord is france 's wish - enshrined in a chirac election promise - to bring down value added tax for the hotel and restaurant trade to 5.5 percent , an idea vigorously opposed by berlin . speaking at the press conference , chirac conceded that france was unlikely to get its way when the matter is voted on at an eu finance ministers ' meeting tuesday . chirac laughs , merkel dismisses " rift " over nuclear threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel missed the chance to publicly denounce the threat in favor of smiles and handshakes .
some in germany also reacted coolly to chirac 's speech on thursday in which he for the first time raised the threat of targeting french nuclear weapons on rogue states that back terrorism . he laughed and smiled when a german reporter asked about his comments during the news conference . " there has been no lowering of the nuclear threshold , " chirac said .
" no one in germany should be the least bit worried .
under no circumstances are nuclear weapons battle weapons . "

judge gerd nobbe ruled tuesday that breuer 's comments " violated a duty not to endanger the creditworthiness of the unit " and violated confidentiality .
the bank had a business relationship with a unit of the company . no capital available , breuer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch had a vast empire which included film and pay-tv kirch says that breuer hurt his company 's credit worthiness during a 2002 television interview by implying that banks would not continue to extend credit to the company .
as a result , kirch maintains that the group became insolvent because it affected his ability to raise money to turn his company around . in the interview , breuer , then the bank 's chief executive , told bloomberg tv " that the finance sector is not prepared , without changes , to make further capital available . " the kirch group filed for bankruptcy in april 2002 . suit limited the federal court limited the suit to damages incurred by the kirch group 's printbeteiligungs gmbh , with which deutsche bank had a contractual relationship .
and it is up to kirch to show that breuer 's comments caused the company 's insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that breuer can be held personally liable kirch 's attorney peter gauweiler called the decision only a partial victory .
the court did not put a value on the lawsuit .
estimates show that the subsidiary is worth between 600 million and 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 737 million and $ 1.84 billion -rrb- . deutsche bank attorney peter heckel told the associated press that to suggest that breuer 's comment led to the loss of that amount was " absolutely incorrect " and said he did not expect the suit to be successful . kirch tried before kirch tried to get the courts interested in deutsche bank before .
in 2004 , he filed a lawsuit against the bank in us federal court accusing the bank of trying to eliminate his company . the court dropped the case . and last spring , he asked german prosecutors to investigate the bank for falsifying balance sheets relating to his company .
prosecutors found no evidence for the charges . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us court rejects suit against deutsche bank a us court has thrown out a suit by former german media mogul leo kirch against us cable operator liberty media and german bank deutsche bank for allegedly conspiring to bring about the downfall of kirch 's media empire in 2002 , deutsche bank said on tuesday .

according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.01.2006 " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary heavyweight salman rushdie on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey . dw-world : what was your impetus to write a book about kashmir ? salman rushdie : it 's a place that has had a big impact on me all my life .
it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .

monday 's bilateral came at a sensitive time for franco-german relations , with the two governments struggling to reignite their historic sense of purpose at the heart of the eu , commentators said . french prime minister dominique de villepin and foreign minister philippe douste-blazy have both been to berlin in the last two weeks in a bid to boost the partnership . but with merkel at the very start of her term in office and chirac nearing the end of his , " europe may not get any of the decisions it needs till after the french presidential elections " in spring 2007 , said sylvie goulard of the centre for international research -lrb- ceri -rrb- in paris . divided on next step for eu constitution considerable uncertainty hangs over the fate of the eu constitutional treaty which was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands last year but approved by the german parliament and 12 other countries . sources close to the elysee said that while france would be willing to preserve parts of the text and discard others , merkel 's view was that the constitution should not be broken up piecemeal . another source of potential discord is france 's wish - enshrined in a chirac election promise - to bring down value added tax for the hotel and restaurant trade to 5.5 percent , an idea vigorously opposed by berlin . speaking at the press conference , chirac conceded that france was unlikely to get its way when the matter is voted on at an eu finance ministers ' meeting tuesday . chirac laughs , merkel dismisses " rift " over nuclear threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel missed the chance to publicly denounce the threat in favor of smiles and handshakes .
some in germany also reacted coolly to chirac 's speech on thursday in which he for the first time raised the threat of targeting french nuclear weapons on rogue states that back terrorism . he laughed and smiled when a german reporter asked about his comments during the news conference . " there has been no lowering of the nuclear threshold , " chirac said .

" at this stage of the investigations , there is no formal , irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret cia detention centers in romania , poland or any other country , " he wrote . were eu governments in the know ? the eu probe comes in the wake of an explosive report published in us daily the washington post last november , alleging the existence of a network of secret jails operated by the cia in europe and covertly flying prisoners though airports on the continent in cia planes . the us government has neither denied nor confirmed the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss military intelligence is said to have intercepted a fax confirming the existence of secret cia prisons marty on tuesday also alleged that european governments , or at least their intelligence services , were almost certainly aware of the rendition " affecting europe " of more than a hundred persons in recent years . " hundreds of cia-chartered flights have passed through numerous european countries , " marty noted , adding that certain revelations had already been published in the media . " it has been proved and in fact never denied that individuals have been abducted , deprived of their liberty and transported in europe , to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered torture , " the swiss lawmaker said in a press release . marty pointed out that the us secretary of state condoleeza rice , in a december speech to europeans , did not at any point deny that the so called " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects to third countries was taking place . but he stopped just short of accusing the united states of lying outright in noting that " the only thing that rice categorically denied was torture . " tuesday 's statements in strasbourg were n't exactly a surprise given that marty had already indicated earlier where his preliminary investigations were leading . earlier this month he accused eu leaders of " shocking " passivity , arguing they were aware of the cia activities for at least two to three years . " there are countries that have collaborated actively , and there are others who have tolerated .
others have simply looked the other way , " marty said . ramifications unknown it remains unclear what the fallout of the probe will be .
the council of europe investigation coincides with a european parliament temporary committee set up last week to probe cia activities in european airspace and territory . the committee has plans to summon high-ranking politicians and intelligence officials in brussels during spring . but some have doubts whether that will happen . " intelligence will not go to their national parliaments for hearings , so there is little chance that they will come to brussels , " british conservative mep charles tannock , a member of the committee , told euobserver .

" at this stage of the investigations , there is no formal , irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret cia detention centers in romania , poland or any other country , " he wrote . were eu governments in the know ? the eu probe comes in the wake of an explosive report published in us daily the washington post last november , alleging the existence of a network of secret jails operated by the cia in europe and covertly flying prisoners though airports on the continent in cia planes . the us government has neither denied nor confirmed the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss military intelligence is said to have intercepted a fax confirming the existence of secret cia prisons marty on tuesday also alleged that european governments , or at least their intelligence services , were almost certainly aware of the rendition " affecting europe " of more than a hundred persons in recent years . " hundreds of cia-chartered flights have passed through numerous european countries , " marty noted , adding that certain revelations had already been published in the media . " it has been proved and in fact never denied that individuals have been abducted , deprived of their liberty and transported in europe , to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered torture , " the swiss lawmaker said in a press release . marty pointed out that the us secretary of state condoleeza rice , in a december speech to europeans , did not at any point deny that the so called " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects to third countries was taking place . but he stopped just short of accusing the united states of lying outright in noting that " the only thing that rice categorically denied was torture . " tuesday 's statements in strasbourg were n't exactly a surprise given that marty had already indicated earlier where his preliminary investigations were leading . earlier this month he accused eu leaders of " shocking " passivity , arguing they were aware of the cia activities for at least two to three years . " there are countries that have collaborated actively , and there are others who have tolerated .
others have simply looked the other way , " marty said . ramifications unknown it remains unclear what the fallout of the probe will be .
the council of europe investigation coincides with a european parliament temporary committee set up last week to probe cia activities in european airspace and territory . the committee has plans to summon high-ranking politicians and intelligence officials in brussels during spring . but some have doubts whether that will happen . " intelligence will not go to their national parliaments for hearings , so there is little chance that they will come to brussels , " british conservative mep charles tannock , a member of the committee , told euobserver . " i doubt it seriously that european defense ministers will willingly come to brussels to be cross-examined by the european parliament .

" the case has been dropped .
there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i. " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , who has gained fame at home and abroad for such books as " my name is red " and " snow " , told das magazin in february . bildunterschrift : a huge poster depicts the faces of 90 survivors of the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire turkey categorically rejects portrayals of the killings - which took place between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was in its last throes - as genocide and has been sensitive to accounts of the bloodshed . it challenges counts that up to 1.5 million armenians died , arguing that the figure was 300,000 , and that at least as many turks died in the civil strife which occurred when the armenians rebelled in eastern anatolia and sided with russian troops invading the crumbling empire . the case against pamuk was launched by a group of turkish anti-eu lawyers which has lodged similar lawsuits against an ethnic armenian journalist and a senior european parliament member . the court had adjourned pamuk 's trial at the first hearing on december 16 on the grounds that it needed the justice ministry 's authorization to proceed . eu hails move critics of the charges had claimed nationalist elements in the judiciary opposed to turkey 's eu membership bid were pushing the case in a bid to undermine turkey 's efforts to meet the legal and democratic standards needed to one day join the european union . in brussels , eu enlargement chief olli rehn hailed the court 's decision to throw out the case , but pressed ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law .

monday 's bilateral came at a sensitive time for franco-german relations , with the two governments struggling to reignite their historic sense of purpose at the heart of the eu , commentators said . french prime minister dominique de villepin and foreign minister philippe douste-blazy have both been to berlin in the last two weeks in a bid to boost the partnership . but with merkel at the very start of her term in office and chirac nearing the end of his , " europe may not get any of the decisions it needs till after the french presidential elections " in spring 2007 , said sylvie goulard of the centre for international research -lrb- ceri -rrb- in paris . divided on next step for eu constitution considerable uncertainty hangs over the fate of the eu constitutional treaty which was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands last year but approved by the german parliament and 12 other countries . sources close to the elysee said that while france would be willing to preserve parts of the text and discard others , merkel 's view was that the constitution should not be broken up piecemeal . another source of potential discord is france 's wish - enshrined in a chirac election promise - to bring down value added tax for the hotel and restaurant trade to 5.5 percent , an idea vigorously opposed by berlin . speaking at the press conference , chirac conceded that france was unlikely to get its way when the matter is voted on at an eu finance ministers ' meeting tuesday . chirac laughs , merkel dismisses " rift " over nuclear threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel missed the chance to publicly denounce the threat in favor of smiles and handshakes .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

" the case has been dropped .
there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i. " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , who has gained fame at home and abroad for such books as " my name is red " and " snow " , told das magazin in february . bildunterschrift : a huge poster depicts the faces of 90 survivors of the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire turkey categorically rejects portrayals of the killings - which took place between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was in its last throes - as genocide and has been sensitive to accounts of the bloodshed . it challenges counts that up to 1.5 million armenians died , arguing that the figure was 300,000 , and that at least as many turks died in the civil strife which occurred when the armenians rebelled in eastern anatolia and sided with russian troops invading the crumbling empire . the case against pamuk was launched by a group of turkish anti-eu lawyers which has lodged similar lawsuits against an ethnic armenian journalist and a senior european parliament member . the court had adjourned pamuk 's trial at the first hearing on december 16 on the grounds that it needed the justice ministry 's authorization to proceed . eu hails move critics of the charges had claimed nationalist elements in the judiciary opposed to turkey 's eu membership bid were pushing the case in a bid to undermine turkey 's efforts to meet the legal and democratic standards needed to one day join the european union . in brussels , eu enlargement chief olli rehn hailed the court 's decision to throw out the case , but pressed ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law . " this is obviously good news for mr pamuk , but it 's also good news for freedom of expression in turkey , " rehn said in a statement . he said he hoped the developments in pamuk 's case would help ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted in turkey . " several journalists , editors , writers and academics still face similar charges today , " he said . " i hope therefore that the decision on orhan pamuk 's case will pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well , so that freedom of expression for all turkish citizens is fully respected .

they plan to put forward a collective parliamentary motion on tuesday in an attempt to get the support of the 25 percent of parliamentarians needed for an investigation to go ahead . left party leader gregor gysi told german public broadcaster ard that the motion would be formulated such that mps from the ruling coalition of social democrats and christian democrats could also lend their support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party leader gregor gysi still wants an enquiry to go ahead it is questionable though , whether the opposition can garner the necessary 25 percent of votes following disagreement between the fdp and the green party , also a member of the opposition . fdp , greens disagree on monday , the parliamentary group leader of the fdp , wolfgang gerhardt , blamed the greens for failing to agree on whether to back an inquiry . the greens had offered the government a compromise solution , saying that if it were to thoroughly inform parliament about the activities of german bnd intelligence agents in iraq , an inquiry would not be necessary . the government agreed to answer questions from the opposition on the issue , prompting renate künast , the leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , to say that the need for a probe was " far smaller " than before . a week ago , all three opposition parties had been in favor of an inquiry .
now , the fdp is criticizing the greens for changing their position too quickly . the greens now face accusations of trying to fend off any potential embarrassment an inquiry could bring to their party .
as the junior partner in the previous coalition government , their figurehead , joschka fischer , was foreign minister at the time of the iraq war . allegations denied in a parliamentary debate on friday , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier strongly denied that agents from the bnd foreign intelligence service had helped us forces choose targets for bombing in the 2003 iraq war . steinmeier dismissed as " scandal-mongering " reports that berlin shared military secrets with washington during the war . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german calls for bnd inquiry despite denials a senior german spy and two federal intelligence service agents denied involvement in identifying targets for the us in the iraq war wednesday .

" a more integrated g and a organization will result in more consistent processes , and reporting and decision-making will become shorter , faster and more efficient , " the company explained . " the new model is designed to enhance competitiveness and promote further profitable growth . " zetsche shows that there is no favoritism in cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche gets serious .
the announcement shows how serious zetsche , who slipped into the driving seat on january 1 , is about cost-cutting and is interpreted as a signal that sacrifices were being demanded not only from the grass-roots workforce but from white-collar staff as well . only recently , zetsche recently announced plans to eliminate 8,500 jobs at mercedes plants across germany .
and his reputation as a merciless cost-cutter was forged while he was head of the group 's us unit chrysler where he slashed 26,000 jobs between 2000 and 2005 . the car maker said the centralization and consolidation of corporate functions would occur " throughout the company " , even top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche will double up as head of the mercedes car division and chairman of daimler .
for example , zetsche himself has already decided to continue serving as head of the mercedes car division even after taking up the position of group-wide chairman . executives doubling up to cover the gaps board members bodo uebber and rudiger grube would also have dual roles - uebber would not only be head of daimlerchrysler financial services , but would also be responsible for finance and controlling of the whole group ; and grube would be in charge not only of corporate development , but also of daimlerchrysler 's participation in the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . that would effectively cut the number of management board members from 12 to nine . " together with other ongoing efficiency programs , g and a costs are expected to be reduced by 1.5 billion euros per year , " saving around one billion euros on daimlerchrysler 's bottom-line , the car maker estimated . " preparation to implement this comprehensive program will start immediately , and take three years to fully implement .
it is expected to require an overall expenditure of about two billion euros from 2006 to the end of 2008 .

the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .

it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.01.2006 " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary heavyweight salman rushdie on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey . dw-world : what was your impetus to write a book about kashmir ? salman rushdie : it 's a place that has had a big impact on me all my life .
it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .

judge gerd nobbe ruled tuesday that breuer 's comments " violated a duty not to endanger the creditworthiness of the unit " and violated confidentiality .
the bank had a business relationship with a unit of the company . no capital available , breuer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch had a vast empire which included film and pay-tv kirch says that breuer hurt his company 's credit worthiness during a 2002 television interview by implying that banks would not continue to extend credit to the company .
as a result , kirch maintains that the group became insolvent because it affected his ability to raise money to turn his company around . in the interview , breuer , then the bank 's chief executive , told bloomberg tv " that the finance sector is not prepared , without changes , to make further capital available . " the kirch group filed for bankruptcy in april 2002 . suit limited the federal court limited the suit to damages incurred by the kirch group 's printbeteiligungs gmbh , with which deutsche bank had a contractual relationship .
and it is up to kirch to show that breuer 's comments caused the company 's insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that breuer can be held personally liable kirch 's attorney peter gauweiler called the decision only a partial victory .
the court did not put a value on the lawsuit .
estimates show that the subsidiary is worth between 600 million and 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 737 million and $ 1.84 billion -rrb- . deutsche bank attorney peter heckel told the associated press that to suggest that breuer 's comment led to the loss of that amount was " absolutely incorrect " and said he did not expect the suit to be successful . kirch tried before kirch tried to get the courts interested in deutsche bank before .
in 2004 , he filed a lawsuit against the bank in us federal court accusing the bank of trying to eliminate his company . the court dropped the case . and last spring , he asked german prosecutors to investigate the bank for falsifying balance sheets relating to his company .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

the announcement shows how serious zetsche , who slipped into the driving seat on january 1 , is about cost-cutting and is interpreted as a signal that sacrifices were being demanded not only from the grass-roots workforce but from white-collar staff as well . only recently , zetsche recently announced plans to eliminate 8,500 jobs at mercedes plants across germany .
and his reputation as a merciless cost-cutter was forged while he was head of the group 's us unit chrysler where he slashed 26,000 jobs between 2000 and 2005 . the car maker said the centralization and consolidation of corporate functions would occur " throughout the company " , even top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche will double up as head of the mercedes car division and chairman of daimler .
for example , zetsche himself has already decided to continue serving as head of the mercedes car division even after taking up the position of group-wide chairman . executives doubling up to cover the gaps board members bodo uebber and rudiger grube would also have dual roles - uebber would not only be head of daimlerchrysler financial services , but would also be responsible for finance and controlling of the whole group ; and grube would be in charge not only of corporate development , but also of daimlerchrysler 's participation in the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . that would effectively cut the number of management board members from 12 to nine .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i.

monday 's bilateral came at a sensitive time for franco-german relations , with the two governments struggling to reignite their historic sense of purpose at the heart of the eu , commentators said . french prime minister dominique de villepin and foreign minister philippe douste-blazy have both been to berlin in the last two weeks in a bid to boost the partnership . but with merkel at the very start of her term in office and chirac nearing the end of his , " europe may not get any of the decisions it needs till after the french presidential elections " in spring 2007 , said sylvie goulard of the centre for international research -lrb- ceri -rrb- in paris . divided on next step for eu constitution considerable uncertainty hangs over the fate of the eu constitutional treaty which was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands last year but approved by the german parliament and 12 other countries . sources close to the elysee said that while france would be willing to preserve parts of the text and discard others , merkel 's view was that the constitution should not be broken up piecemeal . another source of potential discord is france 's wish - enshrined in a chirac election promise - to bring down value added tax for the hotel and restaurant trade to 5.5 percent , an idea vigorously opposed by berlin . speaking at the press conference , chirac conceded that france was unlikely to get its way when the matter is voted on at an eu finance ministers ' meeting tuesday . chirac laughs , merkel dismisses " rift " over nuclear threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel missed the chance to publicly denounce the threat in favor of smiles and handshakes .
some in germany also reacted coolly to chirac 's speech on thursday in which he for the first time raised the threat of targeting french nuclear weapons on rogue states that back terrorism . he laughed and smiled when a german reporter asked about his comments during the news conference . " there has been no lowering of the nuclear threshold , " chirac said .
" no one in germany should be the least bit worried .
under no circumstances are nuclear weapons battle weapons . "
merkel said she found nothing to criticize in the french position . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel to meet chirac under shadow of nuclear statement as chancellor merkel prepares to hold talks with president chirac on the future of the eu and the iran crisis , german opposition parties have urged her to distance herself from france 's controversial nuclear plans .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

enriched uranium can serve either as fuel for atomic reactors or the raw material for nuclear weapons . the european trio and the united states want to take iran before the un security council , which has enforcement powers such as sanctions , in order to put pressure on tehran to cease all nuclear fuel work and to comply fully with a now three-year-old iaea investigation into an iranian atomic program which the united states charges hides secret weapons work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohammed elbaradei iaea director general mohamed elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a newsweek magazine interview earlier this month that if he is not able to confirm the peaceful nature of the iranian program , " that 's a conclusion that 's going to reverberate , i think , around the world . " inspectors want answers the iaea deputy director general for safeguards , ollie heinonen , was leading a delegation of about six inspectors , the diplomat said . another diplomat confirmed the visit would take place . heinonen is seeking answers from iran on five main questions that remain open . the iaea wants to be allowed to visit a former military site in tehran and to get answers to questions about iran 's dealings with an international nuclear black market that supplied it with crucial atomic technology , and about possible nuclear weapons-related work , which may include outfitting missiles to carry nuclear payloads . diplomats have told afp that iran may have received in 1997 three sophisticated p-2 centrifuges , which are machines capable of enriching uranium , from the black-market network of disgraced pakistani nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color satellite image of the natanz nuclear facility in iran iran denies having received imports of such centrifuges . a diplomat said the iaea has only recently obtained declassified us intelligence on p-2 centrifuges as well as on alleged work by iran on adapting missiles for nuclear warheads . heinonen is to file a progress report ahead of the february 2 meeting , with a more detailed account coming in march , elbaradei said monday .

enriched uranium can serve either as fuel for atomic reactors or the raw material for nuclear weapons . the european trio and the united states want to take iran before the un security council , which has enforcement powers such as sanctions , in order to put pressure on tehran to cease all nuclear fuel work and to comply fully with a now three-year-old iaea investigation into an iranian atomic program which the united states charges hides secret weapons work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohammed elbaradei iaea director general mohamed elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a newsweek magazine interview earlier this month that if he is not able to confirm the peaceful nature of the iranian program , " that 's a conclusion that 's going to reverberate , i think , around the world .

" at this stage of the investigations , there is no formal , irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret cia detention centers in romania , poland or any other country , " he wrote . were eu governments in the know ? the eu probe comes in the wake of an explosive report published in us daily the washington post last november , alleging the existence of a network of secret jails operated by the cia in europe and covertly flying prisoners though airports on the continent in cia planes . the us government has neither denied nor confirmed the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss military intelligence is said to have intercepted a fax confirming the existence of secret cia prisons marty on tuesday also alleged that european governments , or at least their intelligence services , were almost certainly aware of the rendition " affecting europe " of more than a hundred persons in recent years . " hundreds of cia-chartered flights have passed through numerous european countries , " marty noted , adding that certain revelations had already been published in the media . " it has been proved and in fact never denied that individuals have been abducted , deprived of their liberty and transported in europe , to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered torture , " the swiss lawmaker said in a press release . marty pointed out that the us secretary of state condoleeza rice , in a december speech to europeans , did not at any point deny that the so called " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects to third countries was taking place . but he stopped just short of accusing the united states of lying outright in noting that " the only thing that rice categorically denied was torture . " tuesday 's statements in strasbourg were n't exactly a surprise given that marty had already indicated earlier where his preliminary investigations were leading . earlier this month he accused eu leaders of " shocking " passivity , arguing they were aware of the cia activities for at least two to three years . " there are countries that have collaborated actively , and there are others who have tolerated .
others have simply looked the other way , " marty said . ramifications unknown it remains unclear what the fallout of the probe will be .
the council of europe investigation coincides with a european parliament temporary committee set up last week to probe cia activities in european airspace and territory . the committee has plans to summon high-ranking politicians and intelligence officials in brussels during spring . but some have doubts whether that will happen . " intelligence will not go to their national parliaments for hearings , so there is little chance that they will come to brussels , " british conservative mep charles tannock , a member of the committee , told euobserver . " i doubt it seriously that european defense ministers will willingly come to brussels to be cross-examined by the european parliament .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

23 , 2006 -rrb- the days of a free pee are over when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .
his carelessness resulted in 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 123,000 -rrb- in damages . but at least his radiator 's now ice-free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer cold keeps europe in grip , claims more lives bone-chilling arctic weather claimed dozens more lives in europe monday after an already deadly weekend , with 24 freezing deaths in as many hours in ukraine alone , and rising tolls in turkey , poland , russia and germany .

judge gerd nobbe ruled tuesday that breuer 's comments " violated a duty not to endanger the creditworthiness of the unit " and violated confidentiality .
the bank had a business relationship with a unit of the company . no capital available , breuer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch had a vast empire which included film and pay-tv kirch says that breuer hurt his company 's credit worthiness during a 2002 television interview by implying that banks would not continue to extend credit to the company .
as a result , kirch maintains that the group became insolvent because it affected his ability to raise money to turn his company around . in the interview , breuer , then the bank 's chief executive , told bloomberg tv " that the finance sector is not prepared , without changes , to make further capital available . " the kirch group filed for bankruptcy in april 2002 . suit limited the federal court limited the suit to damages incurred by the kirch group 's printbeteiligungs gmbh , with which deutsche bank had a contractual relationship .
and it is up to kirch to show that breuer 's comments caused the company 's insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that breuer can be held personally liable kirch 's attorney peter gauweiler called the decision only a partial victory .
the court did not put a value on the lawsuit .
estimates show that the subsidiary is worth between 600 million and 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 737 million and $ 1.84 billion -rrb- . deutsche bank attorney peter heckel told the associated press that to suggest that breuer 's comment led to the loss of that amount was " absolutely incorrect " and said he did not expect the suit to be successful . kirch tried before kirch tried to get the courts interested in deutsche bank before .
in 2004 , he filed a lawsuit against the bank in us federal court accusing the bank of trying to eliminate his company . the court dropped the case . and last spring , he asked german prosecutors to investigate the bank for falsifying balance sheets relating to his company .
prosecutors found no evidence for the charges . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us court rejects suit against deutsche bank a us court has thrown out a suit by former german media mogul leo kirch against us cable operator liberty media and german bank deutsche bank for allegedly conspiring to bring about the downfall of kirch 's media empire in 2002 , deutsche bank said on tuesday .

" the case has been dropped .
there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i. " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , who has gained fame at home and abroad for such books as " my name is red " and " snow " , told das magazin in february . bildunterschrift : a huge poster depicts the faces of 90 survivors of the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire turkey categorically rejects portrayals of the killings - which took place between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was in its last throes - as genocide and has been sensitive to accounts of the bloodshed . it challenges counts that up to 1.5 million armenians died , arguing that the figure was 300,000 , and that at least as many turks died in the civil strife which occurred when the armenians rebelled in eastern anatolia and sided with russian troops invading the crumbling empire . the case against pamuk was launched by a group of turkish anti-eu lawyers which has lodged similar lawsuits against an ethnic armenian journalist and a senior european parliament member . the court had adjourned pamuk 's trial at the first hearing on december 16 on the grounds that it needed the justice ministry 's authorization to proceed . eu hails move critics of the charges had claimed nationalist elements in the judiciary opposed to turkey 's eu membership bid were pushing the case in a bid to undermine turkey 's efforts to meet the legal and democratic standards needed to one day join the european union . in brussels , eu enlargement chief olli rehn hailed the court 's decision to throw out the case , but pressed ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law . " this is obviously good news for mr pamuk , but it 's also good news for freedom of expression in turkey , " rehn said in a statement . he said he hoped the developments in pamuk 's case would help ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted in turkey . " several journalists , editors , writers and academics still face similar charges today , " he said . " i hope therefore that the decision on orhan pamuk 's case will pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well , so that freedom of expression for all turkish citizens is fully respected . " " there should be more international pressure " maureen freely , pamuk 's translator and friend , told the bbc that pamuk was overjoyed at the court 's decision , but warned that letting him off should not take away attention from other pending cases .

" the case has been dropped .
there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i. " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , who has gained fame at home and abroad for such books as " my name is red " and " snow " , told das magazin in february . bildunterschrift : a huge poster depicts the faces of 90 survivors of the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire turkey categorically rejects portrayals of the killings - which took place between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was in its last throes - as genocide and has been sensitive to accounts of the bloodshed . it challenges counts that up to 1.5 million armenians died , arguing that the figure was 300,000 , and that at least as many turks died in the civil strife which occurred when the armenians rebelled in eastern anatolia and sided with russian troops invading the crumbling empire . the case against pamuk was launched by a group of turkish anti-eu lawyers which has lodged similar lawsuits against an ethnic armenian journalist and a senior european parliament member . the court had adjourned pamuk 's trial at the first hearing on december 16 on the grounds that it needed the justice ministry 's authorization to proceed . eu hails move critics of the charges had claimed nationalist elements in the judiciary opposed to turkey 's eu membership bid were pushing the case in a bid to undermine turkey 's efforts to meet the legal and democratic standards needed to one day join the european union . in brussels , eu enlargement chief olli rehn hailed the court 's decision to throw out the case , but pressed ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law . " this is obviously good news for mr pamuk , but it 's also good news for freedom of expression in turkey , " rehn said in a statement . he said he hoped the developments in pamuk 's case would help ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted in turkey . " several journalists , editors , writers and academics still face similar charges today , " he said . " i hope therefore that the decision on orhan pamuk 's case will pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well , so that freedom of expression for all turkish citizens is fully respected . " " there should be more international pressure " maureen freely , pamuk 's translator and friend , told the bbc that pamuk was overjoyed at the court 's decision , but warned that letting him off should not take away attention from other pending cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that dropping charges against pamuk will take away attention from other cases " in two weeks ' time there are going to be eight new trials opening , and our concern is that because orhan is no longer part of this group , that there will be less international pressure , " freely said .
" in fact , there should be more international pressure , because there 's a real chance that we can convince the government that it should drop these laws altogether and turn turkey into a democracy along european lines .

" at this stage of the investigations , there is no formal , irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret cia detention centers in romania , poland or any other country , " he wrote . were eu governments in the know ? the eu probe comes in the wake of an explosive report published in us daily the washington post last november , alleging the existence of a network of secret jails operated by the cia in europe and covertly flying prisoners though airports on the continent in cia planes . the us government has neither denied nor confirmed the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss military intelligence is said to have intercepted a fax confirming the existence of secret cia prisons marty on tuesday also alleged that european governments , or at least their intelligence services , were almost certainly aware of the rendition " affecting europe " of more than a hundred persons in recent years . " hundreds of cia-chartered flights have passed through numerous european countries , " marty noted , adding that certain revelations had already been published in the media . " it has been proved and in fact never denied that individuals have been abducted , deprived of their liberty and transported in europe , to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered torture , " the swiss lawmaker said in a press release . marty pointed out that the us secretary of state condoleeza rice , in a december speech to europeans , did not at any point deny that the so called " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects to third countries was taking place . but he stopped just short of accusing the united states of lying outright in noting that " the only thing that rice categorically denied was torture . " tuesday 's statements in strasbourg were n't exactly a surprise given that marty had already indicated earlier where his preliminary investigations were leading . earlier this month he accused eu leaders of " shocking " passivity , arguing they were aware of the cia activities for at least two to three years . " there are countries that have collaborated actively , and there are others who have tolerated .
others have simply looked the other way , " marty said . ramifications unknown it remains unclear what the fallout of the probe will be .
the council of europe investigation coincides with a european parliament temporary committee set up last week to probe cia activities in european airspace and territory . the committee has plans to summon high-ranking politicians and intelligence officials in brussels during spring . but some have doubts whether that will happen . " intelligence will not go to their national parliaments for hearings , so there is little chance that they will come to brussels , " british conservative mep charles tannock , a member of the committee , told euobserver . " i doubt it seriously that european defense ministers will willingly come to brussels to be cross-examined by the european parliament .

judge gerd nobbe ruled tuesday that breuer 's comments " violated a duty not to endanger the creditworthiness of the unit " and violated confidentiality .
the bank had a business relationship with a unit of the company . no capital available , breuer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch had a vast empire which included film and pay-tv kirch says that breuer hurt his company 's credit worthiness during a 2002 television interview by implying that banks would not continue to extend credit to the company .
as a result , kirch maintains that the group became insolvent because it affected his ability to raise money to turn his company around . in the interview , breuer , then the bank 's chief executive , told bloomberg tv " that the finance sector is not prepared , without changes , to make further capital available . " the kirch group filed for bankruptcy in april 2002 . suit limited the federal court limited the suit to damages incurred by the kirch group 's printbeteiligungs gmbh , with which deutsche bank had a contractual relationship .
and it is up to kirch to show that breuer 's comments caused the company 's insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that breuer can be held personally liable kirch 's attorney peter gauweiler called the decision only a partial victory .
the court did not put a value on the lawsuit .
estimates show that the subsidiary is worth between 600 million and 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 737 million and $ 1.84 billion -rrb- . deutsche bank attorney peter heckel told the associated press that to suggest that breuer 's comment led to the loss of that amount was " absolutely incorrect " and said he did not expect the suit to be successful . kirch tried before kirch tried to get the courts interested in deutsche bank before .
in 2004 , he filed a lawsuit against the bank in us federal court accusing the bank of trying to eliminate his company . the court dropped the case . and last spring , he asked german prosecutors to investigate the bank for falsifying balance sheets relating to his company .

the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .

would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .

it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .

it could end badly .
the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .
on his way to school on monday morning , while the mercury was hovering at minus 18 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 0.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the boy did what his friends egged him on to do , and stuck his tongue on a metal lamppost .
would it stick ? the answer ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.01.2006 " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary heavyweight salman rushdie on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey . dw-world : what was your impetus to write a book about kashmir ? salman rushdie : it 's a place that has had a big impact on me all my life .
it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .

it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

" it is now up to the iranian authorities to provide information , " said a diplomat close to the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . britain , germany and france called for an emergency meeting in vienna february 2 of the iaea board of governors after iran resumed uranium enrichment work on january 10 .
enriched uranium can serve either as fuel for atomic reactors or the raw material for nuclear weapons . the european trio and the united states want to take iran before the un security council , which has enforcement powers such as sanctions , in order to put pressure on tehran to cease all nuclear fuel work and to comply fully with a now three-year-old iaea investigation into an iranian atomic program which the united states charges hides secret weapons work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohammed elbaradei iaea director general mohamed elbaradei -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a newsweek magazine interview earlier this month that if he is not able to confirm the peaceful nature of the iranian program , " that 's a conclusion that 's going to reverberate , i think , around the world . " inspectors want answers the iaea deputy director general for safeguards , ollie heinonen , was leading a delegation of about six inspectors , the diplomat said . another diplomat confirmed the visit would take place . heinonen is seeking answers from iran on five main questions that remain open . the iaea wants to be allowed to visit a former military site in tehran and to get answers to questions about iran 's dealings with an international nuclear black market that supplied it with crucial atomic technology , and about possible nuclear weapons-related work , which may include outfitting missiles to carry nuclear payloads . diplomats have told afp that iran may have received in 1997 three sophisticated p-2 centrifuges , which are machines capable of enriching uranium , from the black-market network of disgraced pakistani nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : color satellite image of the natanz nuclear facility in iran iran denies having received imports of such centrifuges . a diplomat said the iaea has only recently obtained declassified us intelligence on p-2 centrifuges as well as on alleged work by iran on adapting missiles for nuclear warheads . heinonen is to file a progress report ahead of the february 2 meeting , with a more detailed account coming in march , elbaradei said monday . " ammunition " for the security council ? elbaradei wants to give iran until a regularly scheduled iaea board meeting march 6 to fully comply , when he intends to file a full report , but the united states and eu negotiators britain , germany and france are insisting on a written progress report for the february session . one diplomat said the west is looking for " ammunition " for its case to take iran to the security council . a european diplomat said : " cooperation and transparency are already overdue so we hope iran comes into line with board resolutions " calling for it to cease all nuclear fuel work and to comply with all requests from iaea inspectors . the european trio and the united states are trying to convince key iranian trading partners russia and china to back their hard line against tehran . but diplomats said the two camps still disagreed on the wording of a resolution for the february 2 meeting , with russia wanting to put off full referral until at least the march iaea board meeting . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un nuclear agency still divided over iran ahead of a un meeting next month , europe and the united states are still struggling to get russia and china on board in reining in a nuclear program the west fears produces secret weapons .

some in germany also reacted coolly to chirac 's speech on thursday in which he for the first time raised the threat of targeting french nuclear weapons on rogue states that back terrorism . he laughed and smiled when a german reporter asked about his comments during the news conference . " there has been no lowering of the nuclear threshold , " chirac said .
" no one in germany should be the least bit worried .
under no circumstances are nuclear weapons battle weapons . "

" a more integrated g and a organization will result in more consistent processes , and reporting and decision-making will become shorter , faster and more efficient , " the company explained . " the new model is designed to enhance competitiveness and promote further profitable growth . " zetsche shows that there is no favoritism in cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche gets serious .
the announcement shows how serious zetsche , who slipped into the driving seat on january 1 , is about cost-cutting and is interpreted as a signal that sacrifices were being demanded not only from the grass-roots workforce but from white-collar staff as well . only recently , zetsche recently announced plans to eliminate 8,500 jobs at mercedes plants across germany .
and his reputation as a merciless cost-cutter was forged while he was head of the group 's us unit chrysler where he slashed 26,000 jobs between 2000 and 2005 . the car maker said the centralization and consolidation of corporate functions would occur " throughout the company " , even top management . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche will double up as head of the mercedes car division and chairman of daimler .
for example , zetsche himself has already decided to continue serving as head of the mercedes car division even after taking up the position of group-wide chairman . executives doubling up to cover the gaps board members bodo uebber and rudiger grube would also have dual roles - uebber would not only be head of daimlerchrysler financial services , but would also be responsible for finance and controlling of the whole group ; and grube would be in charge not only of corporate development , but also of daimlerchrysler 's participation in the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . that would effectively cut the number of management board members from 12 to nine . " together with other ongoing efficiency programs , g and a costs are expected to be reduced by 1.5 billion euros per year , " saving around one billion euros on daimlerchrysler 's bottom-line , the car maker estimated . " preparation to implement this comprehensive program will start immediately , and take three years to fully implement .
it is expected to require an overall expenditure of about two billion euros from 2006 to the end of 2008 .

judge gerd nobbe ruled tuesday that breuer 's comments " violated a duty not to endanger the creditworthiness of the unit " and violated confidentiality .
the bank had a business relationship with a unit of the company . no capital available , breuer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch had a vast empire which included film and pay-tv kirch says that breuer hurt his company 's credit worthiness during a 2002 television interview by implying that banks would not continue to extend credit to the company .
as a result , kirch maintains that the group became insolvent because it affected his ability to raise money to turn his company around . in the interview , breuer , then the bank 's chief executive , told bloomberg tv " that the finance sector is not prepared , without changes , to make further capital available . " the kirch group filed for bankruptcy in april 2002 . suit limited the federal court limited the suit to damages incurred by the kirch group 's printbeteiligungs gmbh , with which deutsche bank had a contractual relationship .
and it is up to kirch to show that breuer 's comments caused the company 's insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that breuer can be held personally liable kirch 's attorney peter gauweiler called the decision only a partial victory .
the court did not put a value on the lawsuit .
estimates show that the subsidiary is worth between 600 million and 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 737 million and $ 1.84 billion -rrb- . deutsche bank attorney peter heckel told the associated press that to suggest that breuer 's comment led to the loss of that amount was " absolutely incorrect " and said he did not expect the suit to be successful . kirch tried before kirch tried to get the courts interested in deutsche bank before .
in 2004 , he filed a lawsuit against the bank in us federal court accusing the bank of trying to eliminate his company . the court dropped the case . and last spring , he asked german prosecutors to investigate the bank for falsifying balance sheets relating to his company .
prosecutors found no evidence for the charges . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us court rejects suit against deutsche bank a us court has thrown out a suit by former german media mogul leo kirch against us cable operator liberty media and german bank deutsche bank for allegedly conspiring to bring about the downfall of kirch 's media empire in 2002 , deutsche bank said on tuesday .

the icy weather that currently has europe in its grip has resulted in a good deal of tragedy , but has also given rise to a fair share of farce . it was a dare that likely wo n't be taken up again anytime soon , at least by one 10-year-old in the town of selb , upper franconia .

would it stick ? the answer ?
oh yes , and immediately , as the panicked boy painfully found out . luckily for him , rescue workers were quickly on the scene , armed with warm water to free the unfortunate , if none-too-clever youth .
the boy escaped with little more than bloody lips , something of a shock , and , one hopes , a little more common sense . petr zeman 's own cold-weather calamity did n't result from foolish behavior , but the call of nature .
the 58-year-old truck driver from the czech republic had to go , so he took a bathroom break at a service station while driving through the german town of lichtenau . but after closing the door of the public toilet and attending to his business , he found he could n't open it again .
it had iced over in the minus 20 degree weather . " i thought i was going to die in there , it was so cold , " he said . " i kept shouting for help but nobody heard me . " fortunately for zeman , another man eventually came to use the toilet and heard his cries for help .
he and several other truckers were able to pry open the frozen door and free the chilly czech . in mecklenburg-western pomerania , a man who was desperately trying to defrost a frozen radiator turned to his blow dryer for help .
according to police , the 46-year-old left the appliance running unattended in his bedroom for a short time , only to return to find the room in flames .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

it 's where my family is from .
one of the reasons i am light skinned is that i am kashmiri .
and kashmiris are somewhat ethnically different than other even north indians .
it 's true that kashmiris are very distinct in india .
as a result if you come from a kashmiri background it 's an important aspect of your identity because you look different from other people .
so i grew up being very certain that i was a kashmiri .
we used to go -lrb- to kashmir -rrb- all the time in my childhood and i 've continued to go as an adult , and i felt that i needed one of these days to take on the subject . with your background , what is your sense of a solution for the conflict ? there is a certain beginning to the suggestion that both india and pakistan are inching towards each other .
but it 's very slow .
the truth is that i think the real solution is the one nobody discusses , which is that both sides need to back away and restore the ancient frontiers .
you 'd get rid of the line of control , reunite kashmir and have india and pakistan both jointly guarantee the borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kashmir conflict has been raging for decades and i think that is the long-term stable solution , because that gets the jihadists out of kashmir .
the problem is , yes , the indian army needs to retreat but while you 've got these groups composed of international guerrillas , it 's very difficult for the place to really be pacified .
the only way to do it is reunite it .
that ’ s what kashmiri people have always said they wanted , but nobody ever pays attention to them . the first step is to begin the demilitarization .
and it does seem as if india and pakistan are inching towards that , but even this earthquake catastrophe didn ’ t persuade them to sink their difference and that shows you how intransitive the subject is . shalimar the clown has been described by some critics as a reaction to 9/11 and the war on terror .
do you agree with that ? no .
because the simple reason is that i conceived the book almost entirely before 9/11 .
what i think has changed is the way it is read .
that 's because everybody else 's concerns caught up with the book 's concerns .
i 've been writing about this stuff for more than 20 years .
but i think what happened on 9/11 is everybody else got interested in the subject .
so i think the same book word for word published in 2000 would have been read differently .
now because everybody is agitated about these matters , the reading , not the writing has changed . so basically what you 're saying is you where ahead of the times ? yes , exactly .
it 's not really surprising , though , because i 'm from there and i 've been thinking about these things all my life and it 's not surprising when you think of something all your life that you 're sometimes ahead of the game compared to people who only started thinking of these things after they were attacked .
it 's still the case that the western world has remarkably ignored the subject of kashmir given that 's it ’ s the only place in the world where two nuclear powers are facing each other across a heavily militarized ceasefire line , you would think it would be of interest to the rest of the planet .
but no .
one of the little things for five minutes that this book is able to do is allow me to talk about kashmir and get it in the newspapers .
it 'll be out again next week , so it is really a forgotten crisis and that is too bad you 've been living in the us for seven years now , how has that experience changed your writing ?
are you still a british-indian author ?
are you an american author now ?
will you become one ? i do n't consider myself an american author , but i do consider myself to be a new yorker .
there are all kinds of people in new york and they are all there telling you their stories .
i do n't know how it 's -lrb- writing -rrb- changed .
i just knew it was a place that i felt would be good for me to spend time there and so i did that , and i feel that i work very well in new york .
the last three novels that i 've published all have more or less substantial passages that take place in the united states .
i suppose what i 'm saying is that an important part of the subject for me has been to look at how different bits of the world join up and what is it about the west and the east and where do you find the connections and how can one make stories which explore those connections .
so i have spent a lot of my time looking east and west at the same time .
i do n't know how long i 'll go on doing it ; it 's very rash to predict your future writing but certainly that has been a real concern over the last 10 years expressed in those three novels . i think the bedrock for me has always been that i am an indian novelist .
i am an indian novelist who like many indian novelists lives in many different places .
but if you look at the history of literature , western writers always gave themselves the right to live any damn place they chose .
if earnest hemingway or gertrude stein wanted to live in paris they did n't become french .
to my mind it 's not a very big subject when a writer moves house , it 's only a change of address .
the question is whether the books are truthful or not .
if they 're not truthful they can be untruthful even if the writer has never left his home country . you have called on the eu to push the turkish government to end the trial of orhan pamuk .
the turkish court has now called off the trial .
are you satisfied with that ?
is turkey in your opinion a european country and should it become a member of the eu ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish court has dropped all charges against orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago orhan is a friend of mine .
and i 'm delighted he does n't have to face this ridiculous trial .
but as he would be the first to say , there are many , many other less internationally well-known writers and journalists up under the same article of the penal code – there are a lot more cases pending which will now not get international attention because orhan is the most famous of writers and that case has been dropped .
speaking as the president of pen in america , we feel it is really important at this point to increase the pressure , because clearly the retreat on this case shows that turkey may be prepared to drop the article of the penal code which allows people to be jailed for being rude about turkey . turkey clearly needs to bring its penal code into line with international norms about freedom before it even has the faintest chance of european union membership .
it 's a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing . michael knigge interviewed salman rushdie send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court drops charges against high-profile turkish author a turkish court has dropped charges against famous author orhan pamuk for a reference he made to the mass killings of armenians 90 years ago , halting a case that cast doubt on turkey 's commitment to freedom of speech .

they plan to put forward a collective parliamentary motion on tuesday in an attempt to get the support of the 25 percent of parliamentarians needed for an investigation to go ahead . left party leader gregor gysi told german public broadcaster ard that the motion would be formulated such that mps from the ruling coalition of social democrats and christian democrats could also lend their support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party leader gregor gysi still wants an enquiry to go ahead it is questionable though , whether the opposition can garner the necessary 25 percent of votes following disagreement between the fdp and the green party , also a member of the opposition . fdp , greens disagree on monday , the parliamentary group leader of the fdp , wolfgang gerhardt , blamed the greens for failing to agree on whether to back an inquiry . the greens had offered the government a compromise solution , saying that if it were to thoroughly inform parliament about the activities of german bnd intelligence agents in iraq , an inquiry would not be necessary . the government agreed to answer questions from the opposition on the issue , prompting renate künast , the leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , to say that the need for a probe was " far smaller " than before . a week ago , all three opposition parties had been in favor of an inquiry .
now , the fdp is criticizing the greens for changing their position too quickly . the greens now face accusations of trying to fend off any potential embarrassment an inquiry could bring to their party .
as the junior partner in the previous coalition government , their figurehead , joschka fischer , was foreign minister at the time of the iraq war . allegations denied in a parliamentary debate on friday , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier strongly denied that agents from the bnd foreign intelligence service had helped us forces choose targets for bombing in the 2003 iraq war . steinmeier dismissed as " scandal-mongering " reports that berlin shared military secrets with washington during the war . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german calls for bnd inquiry despite denials a senior german spy and two federal intelligence service agents denied involvement in identifying targets for the us in the iraq war wednesday .

" the case has been dropped .
there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i. " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , who has gained fame at home and abroad for such books as " my name is red " and " snow " , told das magazin in february . bildunterschrift : a huge poster depicts the faces of 90 survivors of the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire turkey categorically rejects portrayals of the killings - which took place between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was in its last throes - as genocide and has been sensitive to accounts of the bloodshed . it challenges counts that up to 1.5 million armenians died , arguing that the figure was 300,000 , and that at least as many turks died in the civil strife which occurred when the armenians rebelled in eastern anatolia and sided with russian troops invading the crumbling empire . the case against pamuk was launched by a group of turkish anti-eu lawyers which has lodged similar lawsuits against an ethnic armenian journalist and a senior european parliament member . the court had adjourned pamuk 's trial at the first hearing on december 16 on the grounds that it needed the justice ministry 's authorization to proceed . eu hails move critics of the charges had claimed nationalist elements in the judiciary opposed to turkey 's eu membership bid were pushing the case in a bid to undermine turkey 's efforts to meet the legal and democratic standards needed to one day join the european union . in brussels , eu enlargement chief olli rehn hailed the court 's decision to throw out the case , but pressed ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law . " this is obviously good news for mr pamuk , but it 's also good news for freedom of expression in turkey , " rehn said in a statement . he said he hoped the developments in pamuk 's case would help ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted in turkey .

" the case has been dropped .
there will be no hearing as scheduled on february 7 , " pamuk 's lawyer , haluk inanici , told afp . he said that recent penal code reforms had stripped the justice ministry of the right to authorize the prosecution of such cases , leading the court to abandon the trial . the european commission immediately welcomed the decision , but urged ankara to further review statutes restricting freedom of expression under which several other intellectuals have been charged . controversy over armenian massacre pamuk , 53 , the winner of a slew of literary awards , risked six months to three years in jail for " denigrating the turkish national identity " in remarks published in a swiss magazine about the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i. " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , who has gained fame at home and abroad for such books as " my name is red " and " snow " , told das magazin in february . bildunterschrift : a huge poster depicts the faces of 90 survivors of the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire turkey categorically rejects portrayals of the killings - which took place between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was in its last throes - as genocide and has been sensitive to accounts of the bloodshed . it challenges counts that up to 1.5 million armenians died , arguing that the figure was 300,000 , and that at least as many turks died in the civil strife which occurred when the armenians rebelled in eastern anatolia and sided with russian troops invading the crumbling empire . the case against pamuk was launched by a group of turkish anti-eu lawyers which has lodged similar lawsuits against an ethnic armenian journalist and a senior european parliament member . the court had adjourned pamuk 's trial at the first hearing on december 16 on the grounds that it needed the justice ministry 's authorization to proceed . eu hails move critics of the charges had claimed nationalist elements in the judiciary opposed to turkey 's eu membership bid were pushing the case in a bid to undermine turkey 's efforts to meet the legal and democratic standards needed to one day join the european union . in brussels , eu enlargement chief olli rehn hailed the court 's decision to throw out the case , but pressed ankara over similar cases and urged the country to review its law . " this is obviously good news for mr pamuk , but it 's also good news for freedom of expression in turkey , " rehn said in a statement . he said he hoped the developments in pamuk 's case would help ease the plight of other writers and intellectuals being persecuted in turkey . " several journalists , editors , writers and academics still face similar charges today , " he said . " i hope therefore that the decision on orhan pamuk 's case will pave the way for a positive outcome for them as well , so that freedom of expression for all turkish citizens is fully respected . " " there should be more international pressure " maureen freely , pamuk 's translator and friend , told the bbc that pamuk was overjoyed at the court 's decision , but warned that letting him off should not take away attention from other pending cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that dropping charges against pamuk will take away attention from other cases " in two weeks ' time there are going to be eight new trials opening , and our concern is that because orhan is no longer part of this group , that there will be less international pressure , " freely said .
" in fact , there should be more international pressure , because there 's a real chance that we can convince the government that it should drop these laws altogether and turn turkey into a democracy along european lines .

monday 's bilateral came at a sensitive time for franco-german relations , with the two governments struggling to reignite their historic sense of purpose at the heart of the eu , commentators said . french prime minister dominique de villepin and foreign minister philippe douste-blazy have both been to berlin in the last two weeks in a bid to boost the partnership . but with merkel at the very start of her term in office and chirac nearing the end of his , " europe may not get any of the decisions it needs till after the french presidential elections " in spring 2007 , said sylvie goulard of the centre for international research -lrb- ceri -rrb- in paris . divided on next step for eu constitution considerable uncertainty hangs over the fate of the eu constitutional treaty which was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands last year but approved by the german parliament and 12 other countries . sources close to the elysee said that while france would be willing to preserve parts of the text and discard others , merkel 's view was that the constitution should not be broken up piecemeal . another source of potential discord is france 's wish - enshrined in a chirac election promise - to bring down value added tax for the hotel and restaurant trade to 5.5 percent , an idea vigorously opposed by berlin . speaking at the press conference , chirac conceded that france was unlikely to get its way when the matter is voted on at an eu finance ministers ' meeting tuesday . chirac laughs , merkel dismisses " rift " over nuclear threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel missed the chance to publicly denounce the threat in favor of smiles and handshakes .
some in germany also reacted coolly to chirac 's speech on thursday in which he for the first time raised the threat of targeting french nuclear weapons on rogue states that back terrorism . he laughed and smiled when a german reporter asked about his comments during the news conference . " there has been no lowering of the nuclear threshold , " chirac said .

when they wake up on tuesday , their leader will be on his way to ottawa to become the country 's first conservative prime minister in more than 12 years .
the party 's years in the wilderness began with kim campbell 's humiliating defeat in the 1993 election when the party won just two seats in the house of commons .
now , after canada 's second election in 18 months , mr harper 's party has taken seats from the ruling liberal party in its traditional territories in ontario , and from the separatist bloc quebecois in french-speaking quebec .
messages and his campaign is being hailed for the ease with which it has defeated the liberals of prime minister paul martin . "
people decided -lsb- harper -rsb- is competent and he does not seem to be covetous of political power " allan bonner , political consultant " the conservatives ran an excellent , old-style campaign with a message a day , " says toronto-based political consultant allan bonner .
" nobody remembers the policies , but they remember that there was a message . "
meanwhile , for the first weeks of an eight-week campaign that spanned the christmas holidays , the liberals " sat on their hands " , mr bonner says .
a key element of mr harper 's campaign was his transformation in the public eye from extreme us-style , right-wing politician with a hidden agenda , to a progressive conservative who had a clear vision for the country .
" no-one is dying to go have a beer with him or talk hockey , but people decided that he is competent and he does not seem to be covetous of political power , " mr bonner says .
" people thought the liberals seemed to feel entitled to it . "
mr harper was helped along the way by long-running public anger at a financial scandal involving the liberal party , including allegations that the liberal party in quebec received kickbacks from government contracts .
" i travelled coast to coast in this campaign , and the words i heard almost everywhere was the need for change , " says james travers of the toronto star newspaper , which backed the liberals .
many liberal supports have accused mr harper of muzzling some of his party 's more right-wing members during the campaign in a bid to capture the centre ground .
" he has not changed his real ideas , but he has learned from the mistakes of the last campaign , " says stephen clarkson , a professor of political science at the university of toronto who once ran for mayor of toronto for the liberal party .
cultural change nonetheless , mr harper 's promises to cut taxes and tackle corruption and violent crime " made sense to ordinary people with mortgages and kids going to school " , james travers says . "
quebec voters are not angry at canada but at the liberal party " james travers , toronto star mr harper 's victory also means the country 's political centre of gravity looks set to lurch to the west .
although born in ontario , canada 's most populous province , mr harper was raised in oil-rich alberta , the country 's wealthiest province and a traditional tory heartland .
it is a significant cultural change in a country where leaders traditionally hail from ontario or quebec .
however , colby cosh , a columnist with the national post and western standard newspapers and a conservative supporter , says mr harper 's victory will not change the balance between provinces so much as " re-empower them at the expense of the federal government " .
mr harper 's commitment to small government will also affect relations with quebec , which has held two referendums on independence , in 1980 and 1995 .
federalists had feared that a drop in liberal support in the province over the financial scandals would bolster the bloc quebecois and its provincial counterpart , the parti quebecois , raising the spectre of another referendum .
but the strong conservative showing " proves that quebec voters are not angry at canada but at the liberal party " , james travers says .
" it is a positive sign that quebec is interested in the federalist point of view . "
after 18 months of instability , canadians had been hoping for a period of relative calm , but with a minority government , that is not a given .
attention will now turn to the alliances the conservative party might seek .
a deal with the leftist new democratic party may not give it enough of a hold on power .
ndp leader jack layton has so far refused to be drawn on whether he would consider co-operating with the tories .
and it is hard to imagine an alliance between a federalist party and the separatist bloc quebecois .
either way , says mr clarkson , stephen harper will have to govern down the middle and temper his policies accordingly .
for paul martin the outlook is bleaker .
a highly successful finance minister credited for canada 's strong economy , his performance as prime minister since 2003 has disappointed many .
it was his dream for decades to be prime minister , mr bonner says .
" the human tragedy of this story is that he is going out as a footnote of history .
but that 's politics . "

mr harper 's commitment to small government will also affect relations with quebec , which has held two referendums on independence , in 1980 and 1995 .
federalists had feared that a drop in liberal support in the province over the financial scandals would bolster the bloc quebecois and its provincial counterpart , the parti quebecois , raising the spectre of another referendum .
paul martin " is going out as a footnote of history " but the strong conservative showing " proves that quebec voters are not angry at canada but at the liberal party " , james travers says .
" it is a positive sign that quebec is interested in the federalist point of view . "
after 18 months of instability , canadians had been hoping for a period of relative calm , but with a minority government , that is not a given .
attention will now turn to the alliances the conservative party might seek .
a deal with the leftist new democratic party may not give it enough of a hold on power .
ndp leader jack layton has so far refused to be drawn on whether he would consider co-operating with the tories .
and it is hard to imagine an alliance between a federalist party and the separatist bloc quebecois .
either way , says mr clarkson , stephen harper will have to govern down the middle and temper his policies accordingly .
for paul martin the outlook is bleaker .
a highly successful finance minister credited for canada 's strong economy , his performance as prime minister since 2003 has disappointed many .
it was his dream for decades to be prime minister , mr bonner says .
" the human tragedy of this story is that he is going out as a footnote of history .

when they wake up on tuesday , their leader will be on his way to ottawa to become the country 's first conservative prime minister in more than 12 years .
the party 's years in the wilderness began with kim campbell 's humiliating defeat in the 1993 election when the party won just two seats in the house of commons .
now , after canada 's second election in 18 months , mr harper 's party has taken seats from the ruling liberal party in its traditional territories in ontario , and from the separatist bloc quebecois in french-speaking quebec .
messages and his campaign is being hailed for the ease with which it has defeated the liberals of prime minister paul martin .
people decided -lsb- harper -rsb- is competent and he does not seem to be covetous of political power allan bonner , political consultant " the conservatives ran an excellent , old-style campaign with a message a day , " says toronto-based political consultant allan bonner .
" nobody remembers the policies , but they remember that there was a message . "
meanwhile , for the first weeks of an eight-week campaign that spanned the christmas holidays , the liberals " sat on their hands " , mr bonner says .
a key element of mr harper 's campaign was his transformation in the public eye from extreme us-style , right-wing politician with a hidden agenda , to a progressive conservative who had a clear vision for the country .
" no-one is dying to go have a beer with him or talk hockey , but people decided that he is competent and he does not seem to be covetous of political power , " mr bonner says .
voters in stephen harper 's alberta may benefit from his win " people thought the liberals seemed to feel entitled to it . "
mr harper was helped along the way by long-running public anger at a financial scandal involving the liberal party , including allegations that the liberal party in quebec received kickbacks from government contracts .
" i travelled coast to coast in this campaign , and the words i heard almost everywhere was the need for change , " says james travers of the toronto star newspaper , which backed the liberals .
many liberal supports have accused mr harper of muzzling some of his party 's more right-wing members during the campaign in a bid to capture the centre ground .
" he has not changed his real ideas , but he has learned from the mistakes of the last campaign , " says stephen clarkson , a professor of political science at the university of toronto who once ran for mayor of toronto for the liberal party .
cultural change nonetheless , mr harper 's promises to cut taxes and tackle corruption and violent crime " made sense to ordinary people with mortgages and kids going to school " , james travers says .
quebec voters are not angry at canada but at the liberal party james travers , toronto star mr harper 's victory also means the country 's political centre of gravity looks set to lurch to the west .
although born in ontario , canada 's most populous province , mr harper was raised in oil-rich alberta , the country 's wealthiest province and a traditional tory heartland .

commuters clog up our streets on a daily basis - but why do n't they take the bus ? 40 % of us did in the fifties ; that figure has now fallen to 6 % .
and in bristol only 40 % are satisfied with their buses ... so what has gone wrong ?
twenty years on since the 1985 transport act , competition in bristol is virtually non-existent .
first group operate 95 % of bus services in and around the city ... and they have just raised fares by up to 40 % .
it has not gone down well .
" absolutely disgraceful , " said one woman shopping for her lunch in the city .
" i can not see it is warranted at all . "
one man who had struggled through the traffic and taken ages to find a parking space was late for a meeting .
" it is still just better to go by car .
it 's ridiculous .
" it costs £ 6 or £ 7 for my family ... as a city council we have been really foolish to sell up to a private company " .
the group responsible for the bus fare increase will also run all train services in the west from the spring .
kate legrice mack is part of the south west " public transport users group " .
she believes the bus routes should never have been sold off : " first has the highest bus fare increase of any operating company .
privatisation was supposed to be good for the passenger .
instead it 's delivered a big monopoly . "
bristol city councillor dennis brown shares her concerns : " de-regulation has n't worked and i think central government is looking into the way things are organised . "
last week the office of fair trading announced they are reviewing firstgroup 's regulation of bus fares in parts of scotland .
they also referred the initial bid here in the west to run the regions railways .
first has few competitors .
one is tony le voie , senior manager of the south gloucestershire bus company : " we do not have shareholders so we do n't need to charge the - in my personal view - the ridiculous fares that first bus do . "
alan peters has been running a bus since 1991 .
he says : " there 's not a lot of competition in bristol largely due to the fact first sell multi-journey tickets - a good product difficult to compete with . "
but when push comes to shove bristol city council can not tell us how many people are riding on their buses .
" it is commercially sensitive , " says dennis brown .
but he agrees the more statistics first share with them , the better they can work in partnership .
despite repeated requests first group plc would n't talk to us ; although it denied that its £ 55 million profit was excessive given the scale of the business .
in a written statement they argued the case for the price hike : " first are not alone with price increases ; other industries are also affected .
" if buses were operated by anyone the prices would go up .
" the on going increases to fuel are the major contributing factor to rises ... "
so 20 years on has de-regulation been in the best interests of the public ?
a brand new bus station is emerging from the rubble in the heart of bristol .
it is run by first ; the same people who run temple meads train station .

a university of athens team analysed dna from dental pulp found in a burial pit dating back to 430 bc and linked it to the organism that causes typhoid .
scientists have long debated the cause of the plague that ended athenian dominance of the classical world .
the study in the international journal of infectious diseases says a number of diseases were suspected as the cause .
it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history dr manolis papagrigorakis these included bubonic plague , smallpox , anthrax and measles as suspected causes of the epidemic which spread across northern africa to egypt , libya and greece .
between 430 and 426 bc the plague killed almost a third of the athenian population and its armed forces , along with the city 's leader and mastermind of athenian glory , pericles .
the research team investigated dna material in three randomly selected intact teeth found in the ancient cemetery of kerameikos which dates back to the outbreak of the disease .
all teeth were washed and the dental pulp removed was subjected to a series of dna tests .
the results were compared with the dna profiles of a seven disease-causing viruses and bacteria .
an ancient strain of the organism causing typhoid fever was found to be present in the dental pulp of all three dental samples .
microbiological evidence the team said in their research : " for an infectious disease to be considered as a likely cause of the plague of athens , it must , above all have existed at that time .
" infectious diarrhoeas and dysentery as described by the ancients , imply that typhoid fever was an endemic problem in the ancient world . "
the team added that it was the first time microbiological evidence associated with the plague had been analysed .
previously assumptions about the cause had been based on the narrations of a the 5th century greek historian thucydides .
earlier research rejected the idea that typhoid caused the plague because of the symptoms described by thucydides did not fit with the modern day typhoid .
it would be nice to have another lab repeat this work on a larger sample from a greek site of the same period dr daniel antoine institute of archaeology but the researchers said inconsistencies maybe explained by the possible evolution of typhoid fever over time .
lead author dr manolis papagrigorakis said : " studying historical aspects of infectious diseases can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from . "
dr daniel antoine , lecturer in bioarchaeology and dental anthropology at university college london 's institute of archaeology , described the work on dna as solid and said the results were very interesting .
however , he added : " it would be nice to have another lab repeat this work on a larger sample from a greek site of the same period , before typhoid fever is attributed as the sole ' cause ' of the plague , and thus eliminate the possibility of an isolated outbreak of typhoid fever . "

a university of athens team analysed dna from dental pulp found in a burial pit dating back to 430 bc and linked it to the organism that causes typhoid .
scientists have long debated the cause of the plague that ended athenian dominance of the classical world .
the study in the international journal of infectious diseases says a number of diseases were suspected as the cause .
it sheds light on one of the most debated enigmas in medical history dr manolis papagrigorakis these included bubonic plague , smallpox , anthrax and measles as suspected causes of the epidemic which spread across northern africa to egypt , libya and greece .
between 430 and 426 bc the plague killed almost a third of the athenian population and its armed forces , along with the city 's leader and mastermind of athenian glory , pericles .
the research team investigated dna material in three randomly selected intact teeth found in the ancient cemetery of kerameikos which dates back to the outbreak of the disease .
all teeth were washed and the dental pulp removed was subjected to a series of dna tests .
the results were compared with the dna profiles of a seven disease-causing viruses and bacteria .
an ancient strain of the organism causing typhoid fever was found to be present in the dental pulp of all three dental samples .
microbiological evidence the team said in their research : " for an infectious disease to be considered as a likely cause of the plague of athens , it must , above all have existed at that time .
" infectious diarrhoeas and dysentery as described by the ancients , imply that typhoid fever was an endemic problem in the ancient world . "
the team added that it was the first time microbiological evidence associated with the plague had been analysed .
previously assumptions about the cause had been based on the narrations of a the 5th century greek historian thucydides .
earlier research rejected the idea that typhoid caused the plague because of the symptoms described by thucydides did not fit with the modern day typhoid .
it would be nice to have another lab repeat this work on a larger sample from a greek site of the same period dr daniel antoine institute of archaeology but the researchers said inconsistencies maybe explained by the possible evolution of typhoid fever over time .
lead author dr manolis papagrigorakis said : " studying historical aspects of infectious diseases can be a powerful tool for several disciplines to learn from . "
dr daniel antoine , lecturer in bioarchaeology and dental anthropology at university college london 's institute of archaeology , described the work on dna as solid and said the results were very interesting .
however , he added : " it would be nice to have another lab repeat this work on a larger sample from a greek site of the same period , before typhoid fever is attributed as the sole ' cause ' of the plague , and thus eliminate the possibility of an isolated outbreak of typhoid fever . "

the four - a journalist , union leader , and two human rights activists - were arrested after they accused hun sen of ceding cambodian land to vietnam .
hun sen said he was dropping the charges because he had received letters of apology from the accused .
the four were freed on bail last week after a visit by a us diplomat .
they were journalist mom sonando , union leader rong chhun , and activists kem sokha and pa nguon tieng .
a fifth man , yeng virak , another activist , was freed on bail the week before .
it was not immediately clear if hun sen was dropping charges against him too .
hun sen told reporters he had decided to tell his lawyers to withdraw the lawsuits and " put a smooth end to this affair through compromise " .
" those letters written by those men are enough for me , " he said .
" for my part , it is finished . "
several other critics left the country last year before they could be arrested , raising fears about the strength of cambodia 's democracy .
hun sen said he was prepared to forgive these people too if they also wrote him letters of apology .
but there is no sign of leniency towards exiled opposition leader sam rainsy , who was sentenced in absentia last month to 18 months in prison for remarks he made about the governing coalition .

the world 's largest mobile phone group by revenues , and the uk 's fifth biggest firm by market value , said its global subscriber base was now 179.3 million .
the increase included 561,000 new users in the uk , 906,000 in germany and 324,000 in italy .
vodafone chief arun sarin said it was " a good operational performance " .
he added : " sales of 3g devices accelerated in the christmas quarter and we continue to see encouraging take-up of data services . "
shares in vodafone were up by more than 2 % in early morning trading .
european competition mr sarin said major markets had seen increasing competitor activity , while emerging market businesses had reported strong growth .
" we expect to deliver full-year results in line with our existing guidance and our preliminary outlook for next year remains unchanged . "
" if they sold verizon , our view is that there would be a massive uplift in value to shareholders " david cumming , standard life the firm saw lower growth in germany , italy and the uk because of increased competition , but said this had been offset by strong revenue growth in romania , egypt and south africa .
blended annual average revenue per user -lrb- arpu -rrb- , a major industry benchmark gauge , fell 7.8 % year-on-year in germany , 8.3 % in italy and 4.3 % in the uk , in the face of stiff competition and regulatory drives to cut prices .
in december , vodafone expanded its presence in emerging markets by buying turkey 's second biggest mobile telephone operator , telsim , for $ 4.5bn -lrb- £ 2.5bn -rrb- .
' refocus operations ' speculation had been mounting that the firm might be about to bow to shareholder pressure to offload its 45 % stake in us firm verizon wireless .
david cumming , from vodafone 's ninth largest shareholder standard life , had told the bbc on monday that he would like to see a sale .
" if they sold verizon , our view is that there would be a massive uplift in value to shareholders , " he said .
" it would allow them to refocus on their operations in europe and japan in particular , which have been disappointing . "
he said a verizon sale could add 20 % to share value and boost share earnings .
japanese competition but in its statement , vodafone said that verizon wireless " continues to perform well in the united states " and that " performance in japan reflects ongoing execution of its recovery plan " .
later , mr sarin said the value of the verizon stake had appreciated by about $ 10bn a year for the last couple of years .
" the financial benefits of our holding on to this asset over the last couple of years have been compelling , " he said .
" that 's why the board has chosen not to sell this asset at this time . "
however he did not rule out selling it " in the future " when they had maximised value for shareholders .
meanwhile , vodafone conceded that japan remained a challenging market for the firm .
it faces fierce competition in japan from rivals such as ntt docomo and kddi , and has been struggling to halt a decline there ever since the 2004 introduction of its third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- service flopped .

david cumming , from vodafone 's ninth largest shareholder standard life , had told the bbc on monday that he would like to see a sale .
" if they sold verizon , our view is that there would be a massive uplift in value to shareholders , " he said .
" it would allow them to refocus on their operations in europe and japan in particular , which have been disappointing . "
he said a verizon sale could add 20 % to share value and boost share earnings .
japanese competition but in its statement , vodafone said that verizon wireless " continues to perform well in the united states " and that " performance in japan reflects ongoing execution of its recovery plan " .
later , mr sarin said the value of the verizon stake had appreciated by about $ 10bn a year for the last couple of years .
" the financial benefits of our holding on to this asset over the last couple of years have been compelling , " he said .
" that 's why the board has chosen not to sell this asset at this time . "
however he did not rule out selling it " in the future " when they had maximised value for shareholders .
meanwhile , vodafone conceded that japan remained a challenging market for the firm .
it faces fierce competition in japan from rivals such as ntt docomo and kddi , and has been struggling to halt a decline there ever since the 2004 introduction of its third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- service flopped .

the 50 gold-plated trophies are being exhibited in times square .
british actor sir anthony hopkins was among the first visitors to the exhibition .
he won an oscar in 1992 for silence of the lambs .
the statuettes will be on show until 1 february when they will travel to los angeles before the ceremony on 5 march .
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is hoping to drum up interest in this year 's awards with the unusual display .
academy co-ordinator randy haberkamp said : " it 's not something you see regularly , so unless you have an uncle or aunt or somebody who won one , chances are pretty slim you 've seen one right up close . "
each statue is 13.5 inches tall and weighs eight pounds .
costing $ 400 -lrb- £ 224 -rrb- each to make , they are made from steel alloy britannium which is then dipped in 24k gold plating .
" they 're shinier and look better-made , " said new yorker marcia fokas , who had come to see the display .
" i think it 's good they 're coming to new york .
jaded new yorkers take this in their stride because we see this kind of stuff all the time , but to out-of-towners , this would seem special . "

ministers hope the changes will improve lives as well as save money , but how easy will it be for mentally ill people to find work ?
bruce murray says he would love to get a job but has been unable to get off incapacity benefit because of the mental illness he has suffered from for more than 20 years .
the 41-year-old from elland , west yorkshire , was diagnosed with schizophrenia after suffering a serious breakdown at the age of 17 .
this was followed by a spell in hospital and several other breakdowns over the years .
side effects while his condition is now under control , he has found it impossible to get paid work .
he has to have an injection of drugs to control his schizophrenia once a fortnight , which turns him " more or less back to normal " but the medication has side effects which make working difficult .
he takes other medication to temper the side-effects but still suffers from shaking , extreme tiredness and flu-like symptoms .
despite his illness , mr murray has consistently tried to get work and enrolled on several education and training programmes .
after leaving hospital after his first breakdown in the 1980s , mr murray spent time in a rehabilitation unit before getting work for a firm which employed disabled people .
he worked there for two years but left after suffering another breakdown .
in any case , the firm did not pay him enough to live on , he said .
after enrolling in an adult training scheme , he quickly realised his illness meant that , no matter what his qualifications , the only work likely to be open to him was low paid jobs such as washing up in kitchens .
he has since taken a levels and completed an open university degree in human geography and has undertaken various forms of unpaid and voluntary work .
among them was a work placement at the citizens advice bureau , helping with administration .
he says he enjoys working - even unpaid work - as it gives him something to do .
wary employers he says : " people who say we all like sitting at home are wrong .
it 's fine for a month or two but after that it 's pure hell . "
but he says : " i 've never actually got to the stage where someone would take me on for paid employment .
" the reason they give usually is that i 'm on this medication .
i 've been to lots of interviews and what kept coming up is the mental health problem . "
he says he went into education because he could n't find work , but has now realised there are few jobs open to him despite his qualifications . "
we 're the wrong target .
what we 've got to do is change the attitude of employers rather than those on incapacity benefit " bruce murray " when i finished my degree i thought i might become a teacher myself .
" but they wrote back saying it was far too risky .
so there are limitations on the types of job you can apply for .
it 's not because of your abilities , it 's because of society 's attitude .
" qualifications actually make matters worse for people like me because , for the sorts of jobs available to us , having an education makes it harder to find work .
i 'm over-qualified .
a lot of employers see that as a problem . "
neither is it easy to live on incapacity benefit .
mr murray says : " right now i 've got 50 pence to last me until wednesday when i get my benefit .
' trouble ahead ' " we 've got to be really careful with it and budget .
if i was to get ill again i would n't be able to manage that at all . "
all the same , he predicts problems for the government if it tries to force the mentally-ill off benefits and into work without the necessary help .
he says life would come so difficult for some people that they would rather stop taking their medication and be re-admitted to mental hospitals .
and he believes efforts to get mentally-ill people back to work will fail unless attitudes in the rest of society change .
he says : " we 're the wrong target .
what we 've got to do is change the attitude of employers rather than those on incapacity benefit .
employers need educating . "
and he accepts that the time when a schizophrenic will be welcomed into the workplace the same as any other employee is a long way off .
" i appreciate that 20 years ago people like me were in hospital but i think it will be another 20 years before people like me can fully live in the community and work . "

ministers hope the changes will improve lives as well as save money , but how easy will it be for mentally ill people to find work ?
bruce murray says he would love to get a job but has been unable to get off incapacity benefit because of the mental illness he has suffered from for more than 20 years .
the 41-year-old from elland , west yorkshire , was diagnosed with schizophrenia after suffering a serious breakdown at the age of 17 .
this was followed by a spell in hospital and several other breakdowns over the years .
side effects while his condition is now under control , he has found it impossible to get paid work .
he has to have an injection of drugs to control his schizophrenia once a fortnight , which turns him " more or less back to normal " but the medication has side effects which make working difficult .
he takes other medication to temper the side-effects but still suffers from shaking , extreme tiredness and flu-like symptoms .
despite his illness , mr murray has consistently tried to get work and enrolled on several education and training programmes .
after leaving hospital after his first breakdown in the 1980s , mr murray spent time in a rehabilitation unit before getting work for a firm which employed disabled people .
bruce murray was told it was " too risky " for him to become a teacher " he worked there for two years but left after suffering another breakdown .
in any case , the firm did not pay him enough to live on , he said .
after enrolling in an adult training scheme , he quickly realised his illness meant that , no matter what his qualifications , the only work likely to be open to him was low paid jobs such as washing up in kitchens .
he has since taken a levels and completed an open university degree in human geography and has undertaken various forms of unpaid and voluntary work .
among them was a work placement at the citizens advice bureau , helping with administration .
he says he enjoys working - even unpaid work - as it gives him something to do .
wary employers he says : " people who say we all like sitting at home are wrong .
it 's fine for a month or two but after that it 's pure hell . "
but he says : " i 've never actually got to the stage where someone would take me on for paid employment .
" the reason they give usually is that i 'm on this medication .
i 've been to lots of interviews and what kept coming up is the mental health problem . "
he says he went into education because he could n't find work , but has now realised there are few jobs open to him despite his qualifications .
we 're the wrong target .
what we 've got to do is change the attitude of employers rather than those on incapacity benefit bruce murray " when i finished my degree i thought i might become a teacher myself .
" but they wrote back saying it was far too risky .
so there are limitations on the types of job you can apply for .
it 's not because of your abilities , it 's because of society 's attitude .
" qualifications actually make matters worse for people like me because , for the sorts of jobs available to us , having an education makes it harder to find work .
i 'm over-qualified .
a lot of employers see that as a problem . "
neither is it easy to live on incapacity benefit .
mr murray says : " right now i 've got 50 pence to last me until wednesday when i get my benefit .
' trouble ahead ' " we 've got to be really careful with it and budget .
if i was to get ill again i would n't be able to manage that at all . "
all the same , he predicts problems for the government if it tries to force the mentally-ill off benefits and into work without the necessary help .
he says life would come so difficult for some people that they would rather stop taking their medication and be re-admitted to mental hospitals .
and he believes efforts to get mentally-ill people back to work will fail unless attitudes in the rest of society change .
he says : " we 're the wrong target .
what we 've got to do is change the attitude of employers rather than those on incapacity benefit .
employers need educating . "
and he accepts that the time when a schizophrenic will be welcomed into the workplace the same as any other employee is a long way off .
" i appreciate that 20 years ago people like me were in hospital but i think it will be another 20 years before people like me can fully live in the community and work . "
