" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .

and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .

one of the worst hit areas was the bantul district south of yogyakarta , which was flattened . " there is only one house remaining standing here , that of the head of the hamlet , but even that is not safe anymore as the walls are cracked , " said ngadiyo , 63 , crouching in front of the rubble of his house in central bantul .
" i have never gone through an earthquake this strong during my entire life , " said his elder brother , jodi riwono , 46 , who was trapped unconscious under rubble before being rescued by a grandson . at least 3,002 people were killed , more than 2,500 people were seriously injured and at least 3,824 houses were destroyed , said an official at the ministry 's disaster relief center in jakarta . emergency rescue and medical crews rushed to the worst-hit areas as officials said the death toll may rise .

" the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .

these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .

the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .

last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .

he was arrested by police who said he was already known to them for other assaults and vandalism . a total of 24 people were taken to hospital where 15 of them were admitted for treatment , the others able to leave for home later after medical checks . police spokesman bernhard schodrowski said he could not rule out further people reporting injuries from the attack , which began shortly before midnight when the youth starting randomly slashing passers-by . " it 's total hell here , " a police spokesman said shortly afterward . a short while earlier chancellor angela merkel had officially inaugurated the ultra-modern five-storey hauptbahnhof , and an estimated half a million people watched a subsequent fireworks and light show . the railway station was ruined during world war ii and then lay on the desolate stretch of land on the west berlin side of the cold war wall that divided the city . reconstruction began after germany was reunified , and the station will open for its first international traffic on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .
these days , other countries invest far more in their tracks .

the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .

" the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

" the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

one of the worst hit areas was the bantul district south of yogyakarta , which was flattened . " there is only one house remaining standing here , that of the head of the hamlet , but even that is not safe anymore as the walls are cracked , " said ngadiyo , 63 , crouching in front of the rubble of his house in central bantul .
" i have never gone through an earthquake this strong during my entire life , " said his elder brother , jodi riwono , 46 , who was trapped unconscious under rubble before being rescued by a grandson . at least 3,002 people were killed , more than 2,500 people were seriously injured and at least 3,824 houses were destroyed , said an official at the ministry 's disaster relief center in jakarta . emergency rescue and medical crews rushed to the worst-hit areas as officials said the death toll may rise .

these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .

do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .

when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .

" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .
-lrb- may 11 , 2006 -rrb- barroso wants to delay decision on eu constitution european commission chief jose barroso urged eu leaders on wednesday to put off any decision on the bloc 's moribund constitution until at least 2008 .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2006 embattled eu seeks more time to revive near-dead pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in time , the eu may end up with a constitution the european union admitted saturday there is no hope of rapidly reviving its ailing constitution but sought more time to reflect , a year after french and dutch voters rejected the controversial pact . eu foreign ministers insisted the eu blueprint can still be resurrected , as they gathered for two days of talks on the future of the embattled 25-nation bloc at an austrian monastery overlooking the danube . " the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

today , she is one of the most sought after and best paid top models in the world . dw-world : who do you think should win the 2006 world cup in germany ?
and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

" the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

today , she is one of the most sought after and best paid top models in the world . dw-world : who do you think should win the 2006 world cup in germany ?
and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2006 embattled eu seeks more time to revive near-dead pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in time , the eu may end up with a constitution the european union admitted saturday there is no hope of rapidly reviving its ailing constitution but sought more time to reflect , a year after french and dutch voters rejected the controversial pact . eu foreign ministers insisted the eu blueprint can still be resurrected , as they gathered for two days of talks on the future of the embattled 25-nation bloc at an austrian monastery overlooking the danube . " the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany .

i n 2002 , the warri n g parties officially agreed to a n e n d to the fighti n g i n the so-called pretoria agreeme n t .
despite this , armed co n flict co n ti n ues i n the easter n part of the cou n try , where a majority of the un troops are statio n ed . dw-world.de : ma n y europea n s do n ' t u n dersta n d what the co n go missio n of eu troops is really all about .
what are the soldiers really n eeded for ? albrecht conze : the soldiers have to be able to deal with different likely , possible or even probable moments of crisis .
the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .
one of them will lose and then it 's a similar situation as the one after the first round . the ma n date of germa n troops is explicitly limited to ki n shasa .
is it possible to assume that everythi n g will really happe n i n the greater ki n shasa area ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinshasa this is the political heart of the country - it will indeed be decided here whether the election outcome will be accepted or not .
rallies for one or the other candidate outside of kinshasa wo n't have national consequences .
that 's why it 's really all about the capital . there are rumors that some politicia n s have already started gatheri n g militia arou n d ki n shasa . we have n't seen that , we 're only seeing two candidates who have always had troops that go beyond the pretoria agreement .
that 's the current president , kabila , and one of four vice presidents , jean-pierre bemba .
they have to be watched carefully after each round of elections - depending on the outcome . how did the local populatio n react to the eu missio n ?
do people eve n k n ow about this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph kabila , the current president of dr congo the population will only really realize this when european soldiers arrive and become visible while driving around the city .
but it 's already possible to say that most people here react in a positive way .
that 's been visible in reports on german tv .
but in some places you hear people saying that this is a just a set-up : they say the europeans are only coming to help one candidate and evacuate europeans when things go bad .
these are two rumors that have stuck .
the europeans have to counter them and explain exactly why the troops are coming . but a n evacuatio n i n fact is a n importa n t respo n sibility for the europea n troops . yes , but it 's only one of several . what thi n gs did you have o n your wish list for the europea n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to come to dr congo we made this clear in a letter to the eu presidency at the end of december : we need short-term help in connection with our own mandate in order to secure the elections .
the europeans increasingly understand what this means .
it means encouraging the population : " you can vote freely and we 'll make sure that those elected will be able to take office . "
secondly , it 's a signal to all those who walk around in uniform in kinshasa : " stay in your barracks .
there are highly equipped european soldiers who will safeguard the process .
do n't let people convince you to march against the population for a losing candidate .
do n't even dream about a coup . "
it 's a two-sided mission : determent and encouragement .
that 's were the un counts on europe . but what if the eu se n ds eve n fewer soldiers tha n the un troops that are already there ? what 's that supposed to mean ?
the un has 15,000 soldiers in the eastern part of the country .
here in the city we only have 1,300 troops .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2006 embattled eu seeks more time to revive near-dead pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in time , the eu may end up with a constitution the european union admitted saturday there is no hope of rapidly reviving its ailing constitution but sought more time to reflect , a year after french and dutch voters rejected the controversial pact . eu foreign ministers insisted the eu blueprint can still be resurrected , as they gathered for two days of talks on the future of the embattled 25-nation bloc at an austrian monastery overlooking the danube . " the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

today , she is one of the most sought after and best paid top models in the world . dw-world : who do you think should win the 2006 world cup in germany ?
and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .

" the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .

a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.05.2006 european market hindered by rail system , says eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has a lot of work when it comes to rail transport eu officials say that much more money and effort is necessary to integrate europe 's railways . berlin opened its new main train station on friday , the largest in europe .
and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .
these days , other countries invest far more in their tracks .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2006 intelligence service report confirms bnd spied on reporters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists spying on their colleagues have stirred up a storm the german government 's parliamentary committee has confirmed allegations that foreign intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents illegally spied on journalists to expose their sources . the 180-page parliamentary report made public determined that measures taken by the bnd against german reporters in an effort to shut off leaks violated the law . " regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

he was arrested by police who said he was already known to them for other assaults and vandalism . a total of 24 people were taken to hospital where 15 of them were admitted for treatment , the others able to leave for home later after medical checks . police spokesman bernhard schodrowski said he could not rule out further people reporting injuries from the attack , which began shortly before midnight when the youth starting randomly slashing passers-by .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.05.2006 european market hindered by rail system , says eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has a lot of work when it comes to rail transport eu officials say that much more money and effort is necessary to integrate europe 's railways . berlin opened its new main train station on friday , the largest in europe .
and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .
these days , other countries invest far more in their tracks .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .
these days , other countries invest far more in their tracks .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .

but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks .

it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding .

bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .

he was arrested by police who said he was already known to them for other assaults and vandalism . a total of 24 people were taken to hospital where 15 of them were admitted for treatment , the others able to leave for home later after medical checks . police spokesman bernhard schodrowski said he could not rule out further people reporting injuries from the attack , which began shortly before midnight when the youth starting randomly slashing passers-by . " it 's total hell here , " a police spokesman said shortly afterward . a short while earlier chancellor angela merkel had officially inaugurated the ultra-modern five-storey hauptbahnhof , and an estimated half a million people watched a subsequent fireworks and light show . the railway station was ruined during world war ii and then lay on the desolate stretch of land on the west berlin side of the cold war wall that divided the city . reconstruction began after germany was reunified , and the station will open for its first international traffic on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .

and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .

but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan study shows germans getting heavier german health system not quite in intensive care germany still lighting up germany -pipe- 27.05.2006 germany 's low vaccination rates lead to measles epidemic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaccinations are not compulsory , but most pediatricians recommend them following a massive measles outbreak which left three children in critical condition , germany still lags behind other nations in vaccination rates . german health authorities , in the countdown to the world cup soccer games , have been trying to contain an outbreak of measles in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where nearly 1,200 cases were reported . " the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .
their main argument is that its use to control disease upsets nature 's ecological balance , and gives rise to new , more resistant microbes . " contracting measles is a normal part of growing up .
the goal should be to eradicate complications from the disease not the disease itself , " said dr. friedrich graf , a homeopathic physician and outspoken critic of all vaccines . " we can still reach the 95 percent threshold to eradicate measles without the hardliners , if we could convince skeptics of the benefits of vaccination .
then maybe germany can meet the target set by the world health organization to eradicate measles by 2010 , " concluded monks . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares for potential bird flu outbreak the alleged bird flu cases in belgium and cologne turned out to be false alarms .

germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

what are the soldiers really n eeded for ? albrecht conze : the soldiers have to be able to deal with different likely , possible or even probable moments of crisis .
the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .
one of them will lose and then it 's a similar situation as the one after the first round . the ma n date of germa n troops is explicitly limited to ki n shasa .

" the peak has passed , but cases are still being reported daily , " said ulrich van treeck , a regional public health official .
" compared to only 34 cases last year , this was an epidemic , with the vast bulk in and around düsseldorf , " he added . dortmund , gelsenkirchen , which is about 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away , and nearby cologne will host 16 world cup soccer matches in the region starting next month .
travelers from abroad have been warned to get vaccinated if they are not already immune to measles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measles is so contagious that close contact in crowds can cause epidemics the disease is so contagious that those who have not been vaccinated inevitably catch it in childhood .
though the majority recover with little more than flu-like symptoms and a rash , complications such as pneumonia can arise in up to 20 percent of all cases . for one out of 1,000 the virus infects the brain and can lead to acute encephalitis , which is often fatal . so far , 160 children have been hospitalized and three have contracted encephalitis , according to sean monks , spokesman for the berufsverband der kinderärzte , a national pediatric association . vaccinations not required of schoolchildren unlike the americas , scandinavia and the uk , vaccinations are not compulsory in germany . " since two shots of the measles vaccine are needed for full immunity , many children miss out on the second dose , because the parent simply forgot about it .
the danger of measles is underestimated , but vaccination rates would shoot up if parents were aware of potential brain damage , " said monks .
the first jab is administered at one year and the second one at least four weeks later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double dose of the measles vaccine is necessary for full effectiveness in germany , only 66 percent of schoolchildren get the vital double dose , according to the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , a federal agency for disease control and prevention .
the march outbreak started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school .
since then it has spread throughout the ruhr region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the epidemic started with 13 pupils in a duisburg school " those not immune could have easily gotten an emergency vaccine that would have blocked further transmission of the virus , " said dr. heinz-josef schmitt , head of the vaccination board at the rki who favors a " no vaccination , no school " rule as in the united states . vaccinations for the collective good in the 1960s , vaccinations against polio and smallpox were compulsory in germany , but responsibility for immunizing children then shifted from public health physicians to pediatricians in private practice , according to sean monks . " most favor vaccinations , but about 3-5 percent are hardliners opposed to them , while another 15 percent could be swayed either way .
the point is we have tremendously good vaccines today , which could easily eradicate measles .
to vaccinate or not can not be a matter left up to individual choice , " added monks . " germans just do n't understand the concept of social responsibility as far as public health matters go - that it is reckless for parents not to immunize their child who becomes infected , and then passes on a disease that could be deadly for someone else , " said the rki 's schmitt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infected child can easily transmit diseases that are harmful to others those opposed to vaccines tend to subscribe to an alternative view of medicine .

and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

today , she is one of the most sought after and best paid top models in the world . dw-world : who do you think should win the 2006 world cup in germany ?
and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

today , she is one of the most sought after and best paid top models in the world . dw-world : who do you think should win the 2006 world cup in germany ?
and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .
i belong to the sixth generation of my family in brazil .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .

and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .

and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.05.2006 european market hindered by rail system , says eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has a lot of work when it comes to rail transport eu officials say that much more money and effort is necessary to integrate europe 's railways . berlin opened its new main train station on friday , the largest in europe .
and two days later , it will begin to redirect and revamp the way transport is handled in the capital , which is considered a crossroads of europe .
it is expected that 1,100 trains and about 300,000 passengers will use the station daily . but the new station does n't just play an important role for berlin - it also will create opportunities for the rest of europe , especially for those traveling to southwestern europe , scandinavia , poland and russia . it is an example of eu railway success as it brings modern train travel to a new level .
but it also shows how european train companies elsewhere are falling behind .
before world war ii it took 27 hours to travel to tallinn from berlin ; now it takes 60 hours because the tracks have n't been brought up to speed . officials say that the eu states have to figure out a way to modernize and better coordinate their railways - everywhere . western half of eu does better brussel 's midi is a central point for international high-speed rain in europe .
for 10 years now , high-speed trains have linked the belgian capital to paris , cologne and amsterdam .
the eurostar connects the city with london .
and the ice international train from germany 's train company brings passengers quickly from frankfurt to brussels , while the french tgv whisks them up from southern france to europe 's capital city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv is one of europe 's most advanced trains belgium 's international hub has become a successful example of the transportation policy of the european commission , the eu 's executive body .
and in countries such as france , belgium , germany and italy , national networks also provide high-speed travel .
but aside from trains such as the tgv - and especially in the eastern european countries - much is still in disarray .
as a result , the eu has come up with initiatives to open the market and create consistent standards and infrastructure .
but progress has been slow so far , according to stefan rynck , spokesman for the eu transportation commissioner . " it 's obvious that the creation of an integrated european rail system is limping behind the rest of the internal market , " he said .
" that is why creating such a system has become one of the commissioner 's priorities . " rhine route is essential the lion 's share of rail transport in europe is not passenger travel but the transport of goods .
and every second shipment crosses a border .
that is why the highest priority is developing the backbone of the european goods network , the route between rotterdam , germany 's ruhr region , basel , milan and genoa , said joachim fried , who handles eu matters for german rail operator deutsche bahn . " for us , the rhine route is not just the main artery of europe but also the axis of the biggest industrial centers and harbors , " he said .
" it is there where we have to deepen and strengthen the transportation networks . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the line through the ruhr industrial area is critical , officials say the rhine project is one of about 20 projects that the eu wants to promote .
some of them , such as the rail bridge between denmark and germany or the alps tunnel project , are controversial . setting standards regardless , the eu is pushing one .
it wants to create a standard license for train conductors as well as to bring the varying signal and security systems in line with each other on all major tracks .
such initiatives are expected to take up to 15 years .
and what is especially problematic is the financing : funding for such projects has been more than halved in recent years . and rail officials say that without more help from the eu , modernization will be difficult to realize . " we were in a great position for years , " said fried .
" but things have become more difficult in the past six years .
these days , other countries invest far more in their tracks .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

" regarding the accusations in the press that the federal intelligence service ... illegally spied on journalists in order to expose their sources , it is to be ascertained that such observations did take place ... these measures were predominantly illegal , " the report read . bnd agents picked through the journalists ' rubbish and traced their research , the report stated .
while none of the reporters were bugged , agents used other measures against them to try to uncover their sources , including stealing a box of his papers that one journalist had thrown away and tracing another 's research in the federal archive . the report , compiled by gerhard schäfer on behalf of the committee , also called for the agency " to formally apologize " to the journalists whom it spied on .
bnd head says sorry after its publication , the german government announced that past and current bnd employees would be investigated on the basis of the report .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , apologized to the media shortly after it was released and promised to take steps to prevent such abuses in future . " as president of the bnd , i apologize for all rights abuses that resulted because of steps taken by the service , " he said .
last week germany ordered the bnd not to spy on local journalists after the scandal erupted over reports that correspondents had been put under surveillance to stop leaks to the press . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin had taken action after the damaging revelations that bnd had kept tabs on journalists and even paid reporters to spy on their colleagues to learn the source of leaks . the release of the report , however , brought up more questions than answers and the extent of the activities has taken many germans , including politicians , by surprise . hans-christian ströbele , green party politician and member of the oversight committee , said he was shocked by the amount of cooperation between the bnd and journalists . " i did n't think it was possible that journalists would work together so intensely with the intelligence service , " he said on friday . one facet of the journalistic " code of honor , " he said , is that the people they speak to must feel assured that they are not talking to informants . just at the beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele is surprised by journalistic informants the information that has already been released from the current investigation has led many politicians , particularly from the opposition , to believe that it will not be the end of it . max stadler , a free democratic politician who also sits on the oversight committee , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper that full clarification would not be achieved until those with political responsibility were questioned .
the most important dereliction of duty was why the chancellor 's office , which controls the bnd , failed to hinder the activities , stadler said . he said he would not rule out a full parliamentary inquiry into the affair , something the green party and the left party are already demanding . " we will need an investigating committee , " said wolfgang neskovic of the left party , who is also a member of the oversight committee . delays in report 's publication bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal intelligence service is under intense scrutiny the document was released on the parliament 's official web site on friday .
however , a focus magazine reporter 's injunction , forced the former federal judge gerhard schäfer to black out passages that mentioned the journalist . the oversight committee had called for any such restrictions to be lifted , saying that the report was based on bnd files and individual testimony .
magazines have reported that the domestic spying activities of the bnd go back to the 1990s and continued up to 2005 .
the reason given was the plugging up of leaks within the service , which is strictly limited to foreign intelligence gathering . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament begins intelligence service inquiry while celebrating its 50th anniversary , germany 's foreign intelligence agency was distracted by the start of an inquiry into its role in the iraq war .

he was arrested by police who said he was already known to them for other assaults and vandalism . a total of 24 people were taken to hospital where 15 of them were admitted for treatment , the others able to leave for home later after medical checks . police spokesman bernhard schodrowski said he could not rule out further people reporting injuries from the attack , which began shortly before midnight when the youth starting randomly slashing passers-by . " it 's total hell here , " a police spokesman said shortly afterward . a short while earlier chancellor angela merkel had officially inaugurated the ultra-modern five-storey hauptbahnhof , and an estimated half a million people watched a subsequent fireworks and light show . the railway station was ruined during world war ii and then lay on the desolate stretch of land on the west berlin side of the cold war wall that divided the city . reconstruction began after germany was reunified , and the station will open for its first international traffic on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .

and who should come second ? gisele bündchen : brazil should , of course , become world champion .
germany could take the second place , since it is the country organizing the event . will you be watching the games ? i can promise , at least , that i 'll watch some of it on tv . what players do you think are indispensable ? i think ronaldinho is extremely important . what do you think about women 's soccer ? i think it 's great that women also play soccer . and how do you yourself stay fit ? sport is a wonderful thing and everybody should engage is some kind of physical activity .
when i was a kid , i played volleyball and even took part in various contests .
these days , when i have time , i go surfing , i do yoga or i play beach volleyball . bildunterschrift : gisele bündchen is a leading top model today what would you describe as the best goal of your life ?
did you ever score an own goal ?
or did you commit a foul ? i think my best direct hit was my decision to become a model .
as for fouls … ah !
many .
as that old saying goes : " live and learn . " you are of german origin .
do you actually speak german ?
nein , ich spreche nicht deutsch .
i was born in horizontina , a town in the backcountry of -lrb- brazilian -rrb- state rio grande do sul .
the town was once mainly colonized by germans .
in the school which i attended , learning german was actually obligatory from third grade on .
but being out of touch with the language for such a long time , i unfortunately forgot it .
my parents , on the other hand , still speak german today .
when they meet their brothers and sisters , they often speak only german .

" the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .

what are the soldiers really n eeded for ? albrecht conze : the soldiers have to be able to deal with different likely , possible or even probable moments of crisis .
the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .
one of them will lose and then it 's a similar situation as the one after the first round . the ma n date of germa n troops is explicitly limited to ki n shasa .

that 's the current president , kabila , and one of four vice presidents , jean-pierre bemba .

but it 's already possible to say that most people here react in a positive way .
that 's been visible in reports on german tv .
but in some places you hear people saying that this is a just a set-up : they say the europeans are only coming to help one candidate and evacuate europeans when things go bad .

the europeans increasingly understand what this means .
it means encouraging the population : " you can vote freely and we 'll make sure that those elected will be able to take office . "
secondly , it 's a signal to all those who walk around in uniform in kinshasa : " stay in your barracks .
there are highly equipped european soldiers who will safeguard the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.05.2006 embattled eu seeks more time to revive near-dead pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in time , the eu may end up with a constitution the european union admitted saturday there is no hope of rapidly reviving its ailing constitution but sought more time to reflect , a year after french and dutch voters rejected the controversial pact . eu foreign ministers insisted the eu blueprint can still be resurrected , as they gathered for two days of talks on the future of the embattled 25-nation bloc at an austrian monastery overlooking the danube . " the treaty is not dead , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos , stressing that 15 eu states representing 60 percent of european citizens have already ratified it . " our proposals today are to continue the reflection period , " said dutch foreign minister bernard bot .
in theory the current period ends next month .
" we 'd like to prolong the reflection period by a year , for example , " he said . eu leaders officially called a " period of reflection " after last year 's double referendum blow to a pact which they had trumpeted as crucial to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanding half-century old bloc . but 12 months later - and despite the fact that 15 eu states have now ratified the pact - the mood in the 25-nation bloc is if anything more gloomy , with the divide between eu elites and ordinary europeans as wide as ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the constitution in its current form the austrian eu presidency , hosting the klosterneuburg talks to prepare for a mid-june summit , has played down expectations of a breakthrough , putting the accent on initiatives to rebuild popular enthusiasm for the whole eu project .
a deeper problem but the fact is , the constitution crisis stems from a wider malaise which a few public relations initiatives will do little to tackle . for some , the morose state of europe 's economy , mired in slow growth and high unemployment , is a key reason for lack of support for brussels , which is perceived more as creating red tape than unchaining potential . others cite the eu 's ambitious expansion plans : following its " big bang " enlargement from 15 to 25 countries in may 2004 , several more newcomers are waiting in line , including bulgaria and romania possibly next year . on the future of the constitution , there are broadly three schools of thought : that it should be adopted in its current form ; that it be ditched ; and that it be tinkered with to make it more attractive to voters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the eu constitution a year ago but realistically , most analysts believe there is no hope of unblocking the broader constitutional dilemma until after next year 's french presidential elections to choose a successor to jacques chirac .
even then critics laugh at the suggestion that the french could be asked again on something which they so clearly rejected last year . steinmeier a rare optimist austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , declined to forecast when the eu will reach an accord on a constitution . " if you are asking me for a date , you will not get one , " she said . british europe minister geoff hoon added : " the important thing is that we take some time .
we are in the very early days of this discussion .
there is no agreed way forward . " but germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , whose country takes over the eu reins in the first half of 2007 , was more upbeat even if no immediate breakthrough is expected . " i assume that the german presidency will be tasked in the first half of 2007 with coming up with substantial proposals by the end of the presidency on how to continue with the ratification process , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

what are the soldiers really n eeded for ? albrecht conze : the soldiers have to be able to deal with different likely , possible or even probable moments of crisis .
the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .
one of them will lose and then it 's a similar situation as the one after the first round . the ma n date of germa n troops is explicitly limited to ki n shasa .

that 's the current president , kabila , and one of four vice presidents , jean-pierre bemba .
they have to be watched carefully after each round of elections - depending on the outcome . how did the local populatio n react to the eu missio n ?

but it 's already possible to say that most people here react in a positive way .
that 's been visible in reports on german tv .
but in some places you hear people saying that this is a just a set-up : they say the europeans are only coming to help one candidate and evacuate europeans when things go bad .
these are two rumors that have stuck .
the europeans have to counter them and explain exactly why the troops are coming . but a n evacuatio n i n fact is a n importa n t respo n sibility for the europea n troops . yes , but it 's only one of several . what thi n gs did you have o n your wish list for the europea n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to come to dr congo we made this clear in a letter to the eu presidency at the end of december : we need short-term help in connection with our own mandate in order to secure the elections .
the europeans increasingly understand what this means .
it means encouraging the population : " you can vote freely and we 'll make sure that those elected will be able to take office . "
secondly , it 's a signal to all those who walk around in uniform in kinshasa : " stay in your barracks .
there are highly equipped european soldiers who will safeguard the process .
do n't let people convince you to march against the population for a losing candidate .
do n't even dream about a coup . "
it 's a two-sided mission : determent and encouragement .
that 's were the un counts on europe . but what if the eu se n ds eve n fewer soldiers tha n the un troops that are already there ? what 's that supposed to mean ?

i n 2002 , the warri n g parties officially agreed to a n e n d to the fighti n g i n the so-called pretoria agreeme n t .
despite this , armed co n flict co n ti n ues i n the easter n part of the cou n try , where a majority of the un troops are statio n ed . dw-world.de : ma n y europea n s do n ' t u n dersta n d what the co n go missio n of eu troops is really all about .
what are the soldiers really n eeded for ? albrecht conze : the soldiers have to be able to deal with different likely , possible or even probable moments of crisis .
the first of these moments of crisis occurs around the time of the first round of elections .
once the results are announced , it 's important to see who has lost and whether there is someone among the losers who might resort to violence .
we have to keep in mind whether a loser has private troops that he could deploy .
between elections , it 's important to make sure that the atmosphere in the city does not reach boiling point .
during the run-off election , only two candidates remain .
one of them will lose and then it 's a similar situation as the one after the first round . the ma n date of germa n troops is explicitly limited to ki n shasa .
is it possible to assume that everythi n g will really happe n i n the greater ki n shasa area ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinshasa this is the political heart of the country - it will indeed be decided here whether the election outcome will be accepted or not .
rallies for one or the other candidate outside of kinshasa wo n't have national consequences .
that 's why it 's really all about the capital . there are rumors that some politicia n s have already started gatheri n g militia arou n d ki n shasa . we have n't seen that , we 're only seeing two candidates who have always had troops that go beyond the pretoria agreement .
that 's the current president , kabila , and one of four vice presidents , jean-pierre bemba .
they have to be watched carefully after each round of elections - depending on the outcome . how did the local populatio n react to the eu missio n ?
do people eve n k n ow about this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph kabila , the current president of dr congo the population will only really realize this when european soldiers arrive and become visible while driving around the city .
but it 's already possible to say that most people here react in a positive way .
that 's been visible in reports on german tv .
but in some places you hear people saying that this is a just a set-up : they say the europeans are only coming to help one candidate and evacuate europeans when things go bad .
these are two rumors that have stuck .
the europeans have to counter them and explain exactly why the troops are coming . but a n evacuatio n i n fact is a n importa n t respo n sibility for the europea n troops . yes , but it 's only one of several . what thi n gs did you have o n your wish list for the europea n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to come to dr congo we made this clear in a letter to the eu presidency at the end of december : we need short-term help in connection with our own mandate in order to secure the elections .
the europeans increasingly understand what this means .
it means encouraging the population : " you can vote freely and we 'll make sure that those elected will be able to take office . "
secondly , it 's a signal to all those who walk around in uniform in kinshasa : " stay in your barracks .
there are highly equipped european soldiers who will safeguard the process .
do n't let people convince you to march against the population for a losing candidate .
do n't even dream about a coup . "
it 's a two-sided mission : determent and encouragement .
that 's were the un counts on europe . but what if the eu se n ds eve n fewer soldiers tha n the un troops that are already there ? what 's that supposed to mean ?
the un has 15,000 soldiers in the eastern part of the country .
here in the city we only have 1,300 troops .
the europeans will be impressive enough to complete the mission . mathias bölinger interviewed albrecht conze -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans enjoy good reputation among congolese people in congo were happy to hear that german soldiers will be among those headed to congo as part of the eu force keeping the peace during the country 's first free elections .

after days of summing up , judge tamerlan aguzarov pronounced nur-pashi kulayev guilty on all charges , including terrorism and murder .
he said the defendant deserved capital punishment , but that a moratorium on death sentences meant it had to be replaced with life imprisonment .
and as judge aguzarov closed the case - shutting the folder with the verdict which he had been reading out for almost two weeks - there were dramatic scenes of both grief and anger in the tiny courtroom .
some victims ' relatives exploded with rage , throwing themselves at the police cordon , trying to break through to reach kulayev .
they were hurling abuse and threatening to lynch him .
others remained motionless .
it seemed as if they were frozen , unable to leave the courtroom where so many horror stories had been told , so many family tragedies relived .
' cover-up ' in beslan , many had been demanding the death penalty - the only adequate punishment , they said , for somebody who had taken part in the killing of more than 330 people .
nur-pashi kulayev is just a " pawn " according to some still , some disagreed .
across the street from the courthouse aneta gadieva , one of the victims of the siege , said : " spending your whole life in jail is probably worse than being executed . "

on the bicentenary of the great engineer 's birth , exhibitions and re-enactments abound and one or two isambard kingdom look-alikes are doing good business .
the diminutive genius did n't mind a row , and it would be intriguing to know what he would make of the controversy surrounding one of his most picturesque creations - the stretch of the great western railway between exeter and plymouth .
running towards dawlish and teignmouth , the line passes estuarine mud and sand flats dotted with sea birds and pleasure boats , while on the inland side the track is edged with red sandstone cliffs .
but the line flirts dangerously with the sea .
" the track at dawlish is increasingly vulnerable , and the government has got to explore alternative tracks , " says anthony steen , the conservative mp for the nearby totnes constituency .
" global warming is going to be increasingly an issue , but network rail has decided it 's not imminent enough .
there needs to be a new track - full stop . "
catching fish but network rail is taking action .
it is supporting a new study , funded by the government , which will examine the effects of climate change on the railway using dawlish as a case study .
the company has decided safety and performance on coastal railways will be affected by rising sea levels .
at the oxford headquarters of the uk climate impact programme -lrb- ukcip -rrb- , this kind of approach is applauded .
there , they talk about " mitigation " and " adaptation " responses to climate change .
and , according to ukcip 's gerry metcalf , there should be more emphasis on adaptation - accepting the inevitable and coping with it .
" i think it 's demonstrably under-considered .
the climate conditions we 're experiencing in the first half of this century are the result of the emissions that were made at the back end of the last century - they are unavoidable .
so we need to adapt . "
back in dawlish , seaside aromas of chips and seaweed mingle with a faint whiff of climate change fatigue .
i meet a local amateur historian , angela marks .
" i have been told an apocryphal story that the odd train has actually caught a fish .
there has also been seaweed on trains pulling into exeter , with the locals commenting ' rough down at dawlish again ' .
and this was years ago . "
finding solutions so will one of britain 's most spectacular stretches of railway fall victim to climate change ?
it would be dramatic - and hugely expensive - to re-route the line , a move opposed by the liberal democrat mp for the area , richard younger-ross .
" there 's no evidence that the railway has to be re-routed at the moment .

rhyl week , which starts on saturday , aims to bring a ' carnival atmosphere ' to the north wales town , and organisers say it will attract tourists there .
denbighshire councillor glyn williams said the event demonstrates that criticism of rhyl is unjustified .
last year former steps singer lisa-scott lee fronted a campaign promoting the town where she grew up .
" we 're fed up of rhyl getting a bad press when the truth is it is a tremendous place , " said cllr williams .
" rhyl has gone through some depressed times .
properties on the promenade have been left derelict .
" we have gone from a seaside resort where people used to come for a week or two to a day resort where people enjoy the facilities and go home . "
" rhyl week 2006 ... will show the passion that people have for the town " rhyl mayor joan butterfield but cllr williams said regeneration by property developers was improving the town and residents were looking forward to the opening of the drift park project , which includes a golf course and sunken gardens , later this year " there is a willingness and belief in the community , " he said .
the third annual rhyl week lasts until 4 june and events include a charity abseil down the skytower , a street festival in the town centre , an international flower festival and the crowning of the may queen .
partnerships rhyl mayor joan butterfield said partnerships between the local authority , the business community and local residents made the festivities possible .
representatives from rhyl 's business community , denbighshire county council , rhyl town council and the local community have been working on the programme of events since december , she said .
the white rose shopping centre in the town centre helped to market the event .
the recently-formed rhyl business group organised a series of banners for the town centre and students at rhyl college helped design and print a series of posters distributed to schools , libraries , community centres , shops and churches .
cllr butterfield said the week proved that residents and business people were ' proud of their town ' .
" we want rhyl week to put the town on the map , to show the enthusiasm people have in the town and to promote rhyl as a place to visit , as well as a place for business , " she said .

with the bbc formally beginning its own hdtv broadcasts on saturday , four readers give their impressions of the new service .
jeff newton jeff newton : " the picture quality is outstanding . "
having been one of the lucky few to have sky hd installed this week , i 've had five days to form my own opinions of the latest technology in tv .
there is absolutely no doubt that the picture quality is outstanding .
there has been lots of talk about whether it is important to be able to see the sweat on an actor 's face .
it 's not .
it is , however , fantastic to see the detail and colours of nature in the latest discovery hd programme or see one of your favourite movies in screen quality that you have never seen before .
i think possibly the best way to explain the difference between standard tv and hdtv is to remember vhs against dvd .
could you go back to vhs from your dvd ?
no , and i think it 's fair to say that i wo n't be going back to standard tv .
austin grant austin grant : " there will be no going back . "
after the sky engineer left on monday , i had a quick scan through the hd channels - the picture quality is superb .
the first thing i noticed was picture clarity , detail and sharpness , the colours really stand out .
and you are blown away with the feeling of depth perception .
it is amazing how quickly you get use to the hd quality , and end up not watching the normal channels as they look blurry in comparison .
looking forward to watching the planet earth series starting on the bbc hd channel and also the world cup .
you need to experience the viewing to understand what all the fuss is about .
once you do , there will be no going back .
rob preston rob : " standard definition is like watching tv through clingfilm . "
i 've watched several broadcasts in hd including the 5-day international cricket match , the england football friendly and the hd previews on bbc hd .
the most obvious differences between standard definition and hd is the detail and the vibrancy of colour .
watching standard definition is like watching tv through clingfilm .
simple things , like looking at the grass on the football pitch , the whiskers on a man 's beard ; the fine detail is amazing , it 's like you 're there .
rahul patel rahul : " the hype is worthy . "
firstly , the hype is worthy .
some of the broadcasts i have seen have been breathtaking , especially the natural history programmes .
star wars episode iii on sky hd box office was undoubtedly far superior to my dvd copy , though that might change with hd dvd and blu-ray due out soon .
to many hdtv is all about sport and the live cricket coverage speaks for itself .
absolutely amazing , i could read the wording on the players ' shirts and see faces in the crowd .
even more reason , i think , to eagerly await the bbc 's coverage of the world cup .
if i had to find fault with the hdtv revolution , then it 's probably the current lack of actual hd content .
but in time i believe this will change , and hdtv will become the norm .
what next ?
well the engineer from sky , who installed my system , hinted at 3d hdtv - now that would be something !

austin grant austin grant : " there will be no going back . "
after the sky engineer left on monday , i had a quick scan through the hd channels - the picture quality is superb .
the first thing i noticed was picture clarity , detail and sharpness , the colours really stand out .
and you are blown away with the feeling of depth perception .
it is amazing how quickly you get use to the hd quality , and end up not watching the normal channels as they look blurry in comparison .
looking forward to watching the planet earth series starting on the bbc hd channel and also the world cup .
you need to experience the viewing to understand what all the fuss is about .
once you do , there will be no going back .
rob preston rob : " standard definition is like watching tv through clingfilm . "
i 've watched several broadcasts in hd including the 5-day international cricket match , the england football friendly and the hd previews on bbc hd .
the most obvious differences between standard definition and hd is the detail and the vibrancy of colour .
watching standard definition is like watching tv through clingfilm .
simple things , like looking at the grass on the football pitch , the whiskers on a man 's beard ; the fine detail is amazing , it 's like you 're there .
rahul patel rahul : " the hype is worthy . "
firstly , the hype is worthy .
some of the broadcasts i have seen have been breathtaking , especially the natural history programmes .
star wars episode iii on sky hd box office was undoubtedly far superior to my dvd copy , though that might change with hd dvd and blu-ray due out soon .
to many hdtv is all about sport and the live cricket coverage speaks for itself .
absolutely amazing , i could read the wording on the players ' shirts and see faces in the crowd .
even more reason , i think , to eagerly await the bbc 's coverage of the world cup .
if i had to find fault with the hdtv revolution , then it 's probably the current lack of actual hd content .
but in time i believe this will change , and hdtv will become the norm .
what next ?
well the engineer from sky , who installed my system , hinted at 3d hdtv - now that would be something !

having been one of the lucky few to have sky hd installed this week , i 've had five days to form my own opinions of the latest technology in tv .
there is absolutely no doubt that the picture quality is outstanding .
there has been lots of talk about whether it is important to be able to see the sweat on an actor 's face .
it 's not .
it is , however , fantastic to see the detail and colours of nature in the latest discovery hd programme or see one of your favourite movies in screen quality that you have never seen before .
