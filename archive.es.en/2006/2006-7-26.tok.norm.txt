the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .

" al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there .

" the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger .

" at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

one of their major tasks is preparing the population for the upcoming elections .
dw-world.de spoke to caritas ' congo director bruno miteyo . at least half of the democratic republic of congo 's 60 million people are catholic and the church is very influential in this nation the size of western europe .
the german catholic aid organization caritas has been active in congo since 1994 .
bruno miteyo heads the country 's office in kinshasa . dw-world.de : on sunday , congo will hold the first free elections in over 40 years .
how have caritas and other catholic aid organizations helped people prepare for these elections ? bruno miteyo : the work of caritas is the work of the church .
our bishop 's conference in congo decided to train and educate people in the spirit of transition and to accompany them to this election .
for the last two years , we have been all over the country .
the catholic church is very popular here .
we have parishes , churches and many different communities .
we have been training people how to go to the elections , what to do and now , we are almost at the end of this transition period .
now , the elections are coming . what about humanitarian work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of congolese have lost their homes in the past decade we work especially in the area of emergency measures .
we are one country in africa , which has faced a major catastrophe .
during the last 10 years , 3.8 million people have died because of the war and because of the intolerance .
more than 2.5 million people are internally displaced .
they are running through the country and do n't have anything .
so , caritas and other aid organizations are trying to give them support , food and medicine in order to give those people who are suffering a small sense of dignity . the catholic church has an extensive presence in the democratic republic of congo .
how does caritas benefit from the church 's infrastructure ? the catholic church has been involved in all the infrastructure in health , in schools and in small factories .
but now , much of it has been destroyed by the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the country 's infrastructure needs to be rebuilt the minimum infrastructure you can still find out in the country comes from the catholic church .
we now have more than 1,000 observers for the election throughout the country .
they can take advantage of this infrastructure .
and the population across the country knows that the small support that can be given comes from the catholic church . the catholic church in congo criticized election preparations last week , citing fears of manipulation .
what is your impression of the feeling among the people about the elections on sunday ? first of all , everybody would like to vote .
there is nobody in this country who does n't want to go to the elections .
it is a wish for everybody .
there is the feeling , though , that we are going to this election , but we do n't see clearly where we are going .
that 's why the bishop 's conference said that there needs to be a minimum of conditions to go to the election .
what kind of conditions ?
we need transparency .
we need to clarify some things , which are not clear .
we need to go to the polls with the feeling of people facing a big challenge in order to get democracy , to have leaders who are going to lead the people , who are going to set up a good government .
but there is something that is n't clear and we need to clarify that . sabina casagrande interviewed bruno miteyo send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de distrust of european troops grows in congo when congo holds its first democratic elections in 40 years at the end of the month , european troops will be on hand to guarantee safety and stability .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

our bishop 's conference in congo decided to train and educate people in the spirit of transition and to accompany them to this election .
for the last two years , we have been all over the country .
the catholic church is very popular here .

it is a wish for everybody .
there is the feeling , though , that we are going to this election , but we do n't see clearly where we are going .
that 's why the bishop 's conference said that there needs to be a minimum of conditions to go to the election .
what kind of conditions ?
we need transparency .
we need to clarify some things , which are not clear .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .

it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .
soon researchers will be joining their ranks , hoping to make their picture of the era more complete . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countries agree to open world 's largest nazi victim archive eleven nations - including germany - that share custody of millions of files on victims of the nazis agreed tuesday to open the archives to researchers more than 60 years after world war ii .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .
soon researchers will be joining their ranks , hoping to make their picture of the era more complete . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countries agree to open world 's largest nazi victim archive eleven nations - including germany - that share custody of millions of files on victims of the nazis agreed tuesday to open the archives to researchers more than 60 years after world war ii .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.07.2006 dismissed lawsuit over abducted german appealed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-masri 's case has received a lot of media attention around the world lawyers for a german man accusing the united states of kidnapping and torturing him have appealed the dismissal of his case by a us court . the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing the dismissal of a federal lawsuit filed by a german man of lebanese origin , who said the cia abducted him and transported him to a prison where he was tortured . the aclu , which represents khaled al-masri in the lawsuit against former cia director george tenet , his subordinates and three aviation companies that allegedly ran secret " rendition " flights , asked the 4th circuit court of appeals in richmond , to overturn a may 18 ruling by us district court judge t.s. ellis .
the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .
" and what happened to mr. al-masri as a result of gross executive misconduct must be remedied by our court which is why yesterday we filed an appeal with a higher court … asking that court not to ignore common sense - that to discuss in a court room what is being discussed all around the world will not harm national security . " al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there . ' terribly important case ' the case is currently being investigated in europe and is being watched around the world . " this is a terribly important case , to make sure the us respects its obligations both under our constitution , under international law and under our treaties , " wizner said .
" what the us did to khaled al-masri should make every american ashamed .
all that al-masri wants from our government is an acknowledgement of what happened , an explanation for why it happened and an apology . " tenet , who was director of the cia at the time of al-masri 's alleged kidnapping , and the cia have declined to comment on the case . al-masri deserves a remedy when ellis dismissed the case because he thought it would expose state secrets vital to the us war on terrorism , he still acknowledged that al-masri suffered injuries as a result of the us government 's mistake and deserves a remedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials are also looking into the case the aclu said the case has already played out in the media around the world and such a ruling gives the government too much power to act without oversight . " the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger . " aclu lawyers said they will take the case all the way to the supreme court if they have to in order to get al-masri what he wants . " at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .
that 's why i decided to insert a glass wedge through the front of the arsenal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind -lrb- right -rrb- shows former defense minister peter struck his plan the notch in the facade of the dresden museum - like a bolt of lightening - is an allusion to the unsoundness of this world , according to libeskind .
the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .
dresden wants to step away from the homage-paying collection it used to be and replace it will a fresh exhibition concept . the new approach means confronting the anthropological side of violence , said gorch pieken , project leader for the remade exhibit . " we examine not only governmental but also social implementation of violence and have attempted to place a cornerstone in the cultural history of violence , " he said .
" we do n't want an overbearing , aesthetic glorification of weapons or a multimedia remake of the trenches of verdun .
neither should it be a hero memorial to celebrate military victories with utmost national pathos . " the search for deeper mea n i n g what , then , should the german bundeswehr 's military history museum represent : the wars of the 20th century and the millions of deaths that occurred ?
or war as dismal tragedy ? the foundation has already been poured , but the public will have to wait for the answer until the museum 's grand re-opening in 2009 . michael marek / -lrb- ana / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional mvoie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

one of their major tasks is preparing the population for the upcoming elections .
dw-world.de spoke to caritas ' congo director bruno miteyo . at least half of the democratic republic of congo 's 60 million people are catholic and the church is very influential in this nation the size of western europe .
the german catholic aid organization caritas has been active in congo since 1994 .
bruno miteyo heads the country 's office in kinshasa . dw-world.de : on sunday , congo will hold the first free elections in over 40 years .
how have caritas and other catholic aid organizations helped people prepare for these elections ? bruno miteyo : the work of caritas is the work of the church .
our bishop 's conference in congo decided to train and educate people in the spirit of transition and to accompany them to this election .
for the last two years , we have been all over the country .
the catholic church is very popular here .
we have parishes , churches and many different communities .
we have been training people how to go to the elections , what to do and now , we are almost at the end of this transition period .
now , the elections are coming . what about humanitarian work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of congolese have lost their homes in the past decade we work especially in the area of emergency measures .
we are one country in africa , which has faced a major catastrophe .
during the last 10 years , 3.8 million people have died because of the war and because of the intolerance .
more than 2.5 million people are internally displaced .
they are running through the country and do n't have anything .
so , caritas and other aid organizations are trying to give them support , food and medicine in order to give those people who are suffering a small sense of dignity . the catholic church has an extensive presence in the democratic republic of congo .
how does caritas benefit from the church 's infrastructure ? the catholic church has been involved in all the infrastructure in health , in schools and in small factories .
but now , much of it has been destroyed by the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the country 's infrastructure needs to be rebuilt the minimum infrastructure you can still find out in the country comes from the catholic church .
we now have more than 1,000 observers for the election throughout the country .
they can take advantage of this infrastructure .
and the population across the country knows that the small support that can be given comes from the catholic church . the catholic church in congo criticized election preparations last week , citing fears of manipulation .
what is your impression of the feeling among the people about the elections on sunday ? first of all , everybody would like to vote .
there is nobody in this country who does n't want to go to the elections .
it is a wish for everybody .
there is the feeling , though , that we are going to this election , but we do n't see clearly where we are going .
that 's why the bishop 's conference said that there needs to be a minimum of conditions to go to the election .
what kind of conditions ?
we need transparency .
we need to clarify some things , which are not clear .
we need to go to the polls with the feeling of people facing a big challenge in order to get democracy , to have leaders who are going to lead the people , who are going to set up a good government .
but there is something that is n't clear and we need to clarify that . sabina casagrande interviewed bruno miteyo send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de distrust of european troops grows in congo when congo holds its first democratic elections in 40 years at the end of the month , european troops will be on hand to guarantee safety and stability .
but the soldiers are not necessarily welcome .

it is not yet clear how long the troops will be there .

government officials see the deployment as an important peacekeeping effort , but most experts call it a symbolic gesture .

but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

" the primary objective is a ceasefire , " italy 's prime minister romano prodi told journalists tuesday , although clear differences were emerging as to when a cessation of hostilities should begin . lebanon 's prime minister fuad siniora had little hope of achieving an early ceasefire as he left beirut . " i want to be clear on this : i do not expect the rome conference to lead to a ceasefire , even if we must do everything in our power to reach one , " he said , making it clear he saw it more as an exercise in advertising the plight of the lebanese people . " this visit will serve to have lebanon 's voice heard and to explain -lrb- to the international community -rrb- the hardships that the lebanese are suffering , " siniora said ahead of the conference . calls to disarm hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah rocket attacks reached haifa over the weekend un secretary general kofi annan said monday he was going to press for a truce and creation of a buffer force in south lebanon , as well as the release of the two israeli soldiers whose abduction sparked israel 's offensive , and an end to hezbollah 's rocket attacks on northern israel . he also stressed the need to secure full implementation of un security council resolution 1559 which calls for the disarming of hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to reassert its authority throughout its territory . many other countries and leaders have called for an immediate ceasefire , including france , russia , members of the association of southeast asian nations and pope benedict xvi . linked to the ceasefire issue is the question of a stabilization force for southern lebanon . peacekeepers ' mandate under debate the idea of deploying an international peacekeeping force to the region was gathering momentum on tuesday , but many questions remain about what its mandate would be , top diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , and israeli prime minister ehud olmert coming up with an outline for what sort of force could be used to police any future peace is a main objective of the rome meeting , but it is unclear who would be willing to take part and how long any force would have to stay . " the basic elements , i think , will be clarified -lrb- wednesday -rrb- , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . almost 400 people , most of them civilians , have been killed in lebanon since israel 's offensive against hezbollah started some two weeks ago , according to information from medics , police and hezbollah . debate with damascus any international force entering the region would need to have a united nations mandate allowing them to deploy in southern lebanon up to the border with syria .
israel has repeatedly accused syria of delivering weapons to hezbollah , which is also backed by iran , across the border .
the government in damascus strongly denies the charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria and iran are accused of arming hezbollah fighters the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- - with the united states as its dominant force - has the command structure , planning capability and political coordination to run such a multinational operation , but solana seemed to doubt that it would play a role . " we have to be very careful with the perception of people since we want to get the people on our side , " said solana , a former nato secretary general . for the eu , there is one obvious benefit to taking part .
playing such a role means the bloc would increase its leverage in the region and its standing as a future broker for peace . " trust is nonexistent " " i think that without europeans ... the force will not exist .
to me it is fundamental that some european countries participate , " solana said . on monday , the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . european commission president manuel barroso told reporters monday , " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent . … only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace . " germans question role the idea of an international force - which would most likely be led by france and turkey , according to us news reports - has caused public flip-flopping in germany . after vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .
that 's why i decided to insert a glass wedge through the front of the arsenal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind -lrb- right -rrb- shows former defense minister peter struck his plan the notch in the facade of the dresden museum - like a bolt of lightening - is an allusion to the unsoundness of this world , according to libeskind .
the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .

" we ca n't detect any genuine willingness on the part of the wealthy nations to make more concessions , particularly in the field of agriculture . " the same can be said about the services sector , she added , " where the west has been raising the stakes for the poorer nations without offering anything substantial in return .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however .

" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .

but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .

however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .

" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .
dresden wants to step away from the homage-paying collection it used to be and replace it will a fresh exhibition concept . the new approach means confronting the anthropological side of violence , said gorch pieken , project leader for the remade exhibit . " we examine not only governmental but also social implementation of violence and have attempted to place a cornerstone in the cultural history of violence , " he said .
" we do n't want an overbearing , aesthetic glorification of weapons or a multimedia remake of the trenches of verdun .
neither should it be a hero memorial to celebrate military victories with utmost national pathos . " the search for deeper mea n i n g what , then , should the german bundeswehr 's military history museum represent : the wars of the 20th century and the millions of deaths that occurred ?

" we ca n't detect any genuine willingness on the part of the wealthy nations to make more concessions , particularly in the field of agriculture . " the same can be said about the services sector , she added , " where the west has been raising the stakes for the poorer nations without offering anything substantial in return . " droege said she thinks negotiators will take many months to find a basis on which to get the talks going again .
she added that none of the western negotiators , including the european union , went far enough to ensure the success of the talks by making agreements acceptable to poorer nations . " co n ditio n s have to be fair " " it 's not the opening of markets and market access alone that makes people richer , " said friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , vice-president of the eu 's agriculture committee .
" trade alone does n't necessarily lead to more prosperity for all players involved .
it certainly fills the pockets of multi-national companies . " graefe zu baringdorf said the conditions in which developing countries are able to export to the industrialized world are more important , " and these conditions have to be fair .
developing countries should be able to export at eu or us price levels .
if the west is only out to make a killing , the developing countries ' negotiators are now organized well enough to say ' thanks guys , that 's not a deal !

" we ca n't detect any genuine willingness on the part of the wealthy nations to make more concessions , particularly in the field of agriculture . " the same can be said about the services sector , she added , " where the west has been raising the stakes for the poorer nations without offering anything substantial in return . " droege said she thinks negotiators will take many months to find a basis on which to get the talks going again .
she added that none of the western negotiators , including the european union , went far enough to ensure the success of the talks by making agreements acceptable to poorer nations . " co n ditio n s have to be fair " " it 's not the opening of markets and market access alone that makes people richer , " said friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , vice-president of the eu 's agriculture committee .
" trade alone does n't necessarily lead to more prosperity for all players involved .
it certainly fills the pockets of multi-national companies . " graefe zu baringdorf said the conditions in which developing countries are able to export to the industrialized world are more important , " and these conditions have to be fair .
developing countries should be able to export at eu or us price levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .
soon researchers will be joining their ranks , hoping to make their picture of the era more complete . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countries agree to open world 's largest nazi victim archive eleven nations - including germany - that share custody of millions of files on victims of the nazis agreed tuesday to open the archives to researchers more than 60 years after world war ii .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

" the primary objective is a ceasefire , " italy 's prime minister romano prodi told journalists tuesday , although clear differences were emerging as to when a cessation of hostilities should begin . lebanon 's prime minister fuad siniora had little hope of achieving an early ceasefire as he left beirut . " i want to be clear on this : i do not expect the rome conference to lead to a ceasefire , even if we must do everything in our power to reach one , " he said , making it clear he saw it more as an exercise in advertising the plight of the lebanese people . " this visit will serve to have lebanon 's voice heard and to explain -lrb- to the international community -rrb- the hardships that the lebanese are suffering , " siniora said ahead of the conference . calls to disarm hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah rocket attacks reached haifa over the weekend un secretary general kofi annan said monday he was going to press for a truce and creation of a buffer force in south lebanon , as well as the release of the two israeli soldiers whose abduction sparked israel 's offensive , and an end to hezbollah 's rocket attacks on northern israel . he also stressed the need to secure full implementation of un security council resolution 1559 which calls for the disarming of hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to reassert its authority throughout its territory . many other countries and leaders have called for an immediate ceasefire , including france , russia , members of the association of southeast asian nations and pope benedict xvi . linked to the ceasefire issue is the question of a stabilization force for southern lebanon . peacekeepers ' mandate under debate the idea of deploying an international peacekeeping force to the region was gathering momentum on tuesday , but many questions remain about what its mandate would be , top diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , and israeli prime minister ehud olmert coming up with an outline for what sort of force could be used to police any future peace is a main objective of the rome meeting , but it is unclear who would be willing to take part and how long any force would have to stay . " the basic elements , i think , will be clarified -lrb- wednesday -rrb- , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . almost 400 people , most of them civilians , have been killed in lebanon since israel 's offensive against hezbollah started some two weeks ago , according to information from medics , police and hezbollah . debate with damascus any international force entering the region would need to have a united nations mandate allowing them to deploy in southern lebanon up to the border with syria .
israel has repeatedly accused syria of delivering weapons to hezbollah , which is also backed by iran , across the border .
the government in damascus strongly denies the charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria and iran are accused of arming hezbollah fighters the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- - with the united states as its dominant force - has the command structure , planning capability and political coordination to run such a multinational operation , but solana seemed to doubt that it would play a role . " we have to be very careful with the perception of people since we want to get the people on our side , " said solana , a former nato secretary general . for the eu , there is one obvious benefit to taking part .
playing such a role means the bloc would increase its leverage in the region and its standing as a future broker for peace . " trust is nonexistent " " i think that without europeans ... the force will not exist .
to me it is fundamental that some european countries participate , " solana said . on monday , the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . european commission president manuel barroso told reporters monday , " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent . … only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace . " germans question role the idea of an international force - which would most likely be led by france and turkey , according to us news reports - has caused public flip-flopping in germany . after vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .
that is : carry on as it has been . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ceasefire and troops on the table at rome conference world leaders are converging on rome before an emergency conference aimed at stopping nearly two weeks of israeli-lebanese violence .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .
that 's why i decided to insert a glass wedge through the front of the arsenal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind -lrb- right -rrb- shows former defense minister peter struck his plan the notch in the facade of the dresden museum - like a bolt of lightening - is an allusion to the unsoundness of this world , according to libeskind .
the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .
dresden wants to step away from the homage-paying collection it used to be and replace it will a fresh exhibition concept . the new approach means confronting the anthropological side of violence , said gorch pieken , project leader for the remade exhibit .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?

the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .
that 's why i decided to insert a glass wedge through the front of the arsenal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind -lrb- right -rrb- shows former defense minister peter struck his plan the notch in the facade of the dresden museum - like a bolt of lightening - is an allusion to the unsoundness of this world , according to libeskind .
the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .
dresden wants to step away from the homage-paying collection it used to be and replace it will a fresh exhibition concept . the new approach means confronting the anthropological side of violence , said gorch pieken , project leader for the remade exhibit . " we examine not only governmental but also social implementation of violence and have attempted to place a cornerstone in the cultural history of violence , " he said .
" we do n't want an overbearing , aesthetic glorification of weapons or a multimedia remake of the trenches of verdun .
neither should it be a hero memorial to celebrate military victories with utmost national pathos . " the search for deeper mea n i n g what , then , should the german bundeswehr 's military history museum represent : the wars of the 20th century and the millions of deaths that occurred ?
or war as dismal tragedy ? the foundation has already been poured , but the public will have to wait for the answer until the museum 's grand re-opening in 2009 . michael marek / -lrb- ana / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional mvoie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

" the primary objective is a ceasefire , " italy 's prime minister romano prodi told journalists tuesday , although clear differences were emerging as to when a cessation of hostilities should begin . lebanon 's prime minister fuad siniora had little hope of achieving an early ceasefire as he left beirut . " i want to be clear on this : i do not expect the rome conference to lead to a ceasefire , even if we must do everything in our power to reach one , " he said , making it clear he saw it more as an exercise in advertising the plight of the lebanese people . " this visit will serve to have lebanon 's voice heard and to explain -lrb- to the international community -rrb- the hardships that the lebanese are suffering , " siniora said ahead of the conference . calls to disarm hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah rocket attacks reached haifa over the weekend un secretary general kofi annan said monday he was going to press for a truce and creation of a buffer force in south lebanon , as well as the release of the two israeli soldiers whose abduction sparked israel 's offensive , and an end to hezbollah 's rocket attacks on northern israel . he also stressed the need to secure full implementation of un security council resolution 1559 which calls for the disarming of hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to reassert its authority throughout its territory . many other countries and leaders have called for an immediate ceasefire , including france , russia , members of the association of southeast asian nations and pope benedict xvi . linked to the ceasefire issue is the question of a stabilization force for southern lebanon . peacekeepers ' mandate under debate the idea of deploying an international peacekeeping force to the region was gathering momentum on tuesday , but many questions remain about what its mandate would be , top diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , left , and israeli prime minister ehud olmert coming up with an outline for what sort of force could be used to police any future peace is a main objective of the rome meeting , but it is unclear who would be willing to take part and how long any force would have to stay . " the basic elements , i think , will be clarified -lrb- wednesday -rrb- , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana . almost 400 people , most of them civilians , have been killed in lebanon since israel 's offensive against hezbollah started some two weeks ago , according to information from medics , police and hezbollah . debate with damascus any international force entering the region would need to have a united nations mandate allowing them to deploy in southern lebanon up to the border with syria .
israel has repeatedly accused syria of delivering weapons to hezbollah , which is also backed by iran , across the border .
the government in damascus strongly denies the charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria and iran are accused of arming hezbollah fighters the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- - with the united states as its dominant force - has the command structure , planning capability and political coordination to run such a multinational operation , but solana seemed to doubt that it would play a role . " we have to be very careful with the perception of people since we want to get the people on our side , " said solana , a former nato secretary general . for the eu , there is one obvious benefit to taking part .
playing such a role means the bloc would increase its leverage in the region and its standing as a future broker for peace . " trust is nonexistent " " i think that without europeans ... the force will not exist .
to me it is fundamental that some european countries participate , " solana said . on monday , the german government said it hoped the conference would reach " rapid and practical solutions " to humanitarian issues such as the evacuation and well-being of refugees who are flooding out of southern lebanon fleeing israeli bombardment . european commission president manuel barroso told reporters monday , " i think it is obvious that this international presence is necessary because the level of trust between the belligerent parties is non-existent . … only with an international force can we have the minimum conditions for peace . " germans question role the idea of an international force - which would most likely be led by france and turkey , according to us news reports - has caused public flip-flopping in germany . after vague responses from german chancellor angela merkel earlier this week in response to questions of whether germany would contribute troops , defense minister franz josef jung reversed the official line when he told germany 's n24 television station berlin " could not refuse such a peace mission " under certain circumstances . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .
-lrb- july 25 , 2006 -rrb- emergency middle east conference will push peace plan as fighting in israel and lebanon moves into its 13th day , european , us and middle eastern foreign ministers have agreed to meet in rome wednesday to try to move a ceasefire plan forward .

" we ca n't detect any genuine willingness on the part of the wealthy nations to make more concessions , particularly in the field of agriculture . " the same can be said about the services sector , she added , " where the west has been raising the stakes for the poorer nations without offering anything substantial in return . " droege said she thinks negotiators will take many months to find a basis on which to get the talks going again .
she added that none of the western negotiators , including the european union , went far enough to ensure the success of the talks by making agreements acceptable to poorer nations . " co n ditio n s have to be fair " " it 's not the opening of markets and market access alone that makes people richer , " said friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , vice-president of the eu 's agriculture committee .
" trade alone does n't necessarily lead to more prosperity for all players involved .
it certainly fills the pockets of multi-national companies . " graefe zu baringdorf said the conditions in which developing countries are able to export to the industrialized world are more important , " and these conditions have to be fair .
developing countries should be able to export at eu or us price levels .
if the west is only out to make a killing , the developing countries ' negotiators are now organized well enough to say ' thanks guys , that 's not a deal ! " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy of france is the general director of wto the german association of wholesale and foreign trade criticized the failure of monday 's talks , saying that a further liberalization of global trade relations was now completely out of sight . it called on germany and the eu as a whole to make more bilateral deals with interested partners in the developing world so as not to yield the ground completely to such countries as china and india . a severe blow to the developi n g world the president of the german farmers ' association , gerd sonnleitner , said the united states had at been willing to arrive at a sustainable solution at any point during the talks .
no result , he concluded , was better than a bad compromise . german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul added that the failure of the talks was a severe blow to the developing world . many poorer nations , she said , are dependent on agriculture as an important source of employment and export earnings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .
that is : carry on as it has been . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ceasefire and troops on the table at rome conference world leaders are converging on rome before an emergency conference aimed at stopping nearly two weeks of israeli-lebanese violence .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .
that is : carry on as it has been . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ceasefire and troops on the table at rome conference world leaders are converging on rome before an emergency conference aimed at stopping nearly two weeks of israeli-lebanese violence .
-lrb- july 26 , 2006 -rrb- germany insists on ceasefire before any troops go to lebanon before a larger meeting planned for wednesday , defense ministers from germany , france and poland said hezbollah and israel need to lay down their weapons before an international force could be sent to the region .

" the same can be said about the services sector , she added , " where the west has been raising the stakes for the poorer nations without offering anything substantial in return . " droege said she thinks negotiators will take many months to find a basis on which to get the talks going again .
she added that none of the western negotiators , including the european union , went far enough to ensure the success of the talks by making agreements acceptable to poorer nations . " co n ditio n s have to be fair " " it 's not the opening of markets and market access alone that makes people richer , " said friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , vice-president of the eu 's agriculture committee .
" trade alone does n't necessarily lead to more prosperity for all players involved .
it certainly fills the pockets of multi-national companies . " graefe zu baringdorf said the conditions in which developing countries are able to export to the industrialized world are more important , " and these conditions have to be fair .
developing countries should be able to export at eu or us price levels .
if the west is only out to make a killing , the developing countries ' negotiators are now organized well enough to say ' thanks guys , that 's not a deal !

no result , he concluded , was better than a bad compromise . german development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul added that the failure of the talks was a severe blow to the developing world . many poorer nations , she said , are dependent on agriculture as an important source of employment and export earnings .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .
that is : carry on as it has been . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ceasefire and troops on the table at rome conference world leaders are converging on rome before an emergency conference aimed at stopping nearly two weeks of israeli-lebanese violence .

the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .
" and what happened to mr. al-masri as a result of gross executive misconduct must be remedied by our court which is why yesterday we filed an appeal with a higher court … asking that court not to ignore common sense - that to discuss in a court room what is being discussed all around the world will not harm national security . " al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there . ' terribly important case ' the case is currently being investigated in europe and is being watched around the world . " this is a terribly important case , to make sure the us respects its obligations both under our constitution , under international law and under our treaties , " wizner said .
" what the us did to khaled al-masri should make every american ashamed .
all that al-masri wants from our government is an acknowledgement of what happened , an explanation for why it happened and an apology . " tenet , who was director of the cia at the time of al-masri 's alleged kidnapping , and the cia have declined to comment on the case . al-masri deserves a remedy when ellis dismissed the case because he thought it would expose state secrets vital to the us war on terrorism , he still acknowledged that al-masri suffered injuries as a result of the us government 's mistake and deserves a remedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials are also looking into the case the aclu said the case has already played out in the media around the world and such a ruling gives the government too much power to act without oversight . " the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger . " aclu lawyers said they will take the case all the way to the supreme court if they have to in order to get al-masri what he wants . " at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .
that is : carry on as it has been . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ceasefire and troops on the table at rome conference world leaders are converging on rome before an emergency conference aimed at stopping nearly two weeks of israeli-lebanese violence .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

" we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however .

" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .

her actions sent her on a trip she never intended to take . the local court in the western city of düsseldorf was busy with cake on tuesday .
this was no office party , but a case involving a cake with a special secret ingredient , which is causing its heidelberg-based baker a bit of trouble . the amateur baker sent her creation through the mail to a 30-year-old man in düsseldorf who lives with his mom .
since the intended recipient was not at home at the time , nosy mom opened the package herself . apparently delighted at the edible contents she found and having a bit of an appetite at the time , she decided to partake .
in fact , she ate half of the thing .
it proved the beginning of a long , strange trip for the 60-year-old . the cake was chock full of marijuana , which sent the unsuspecting and somewhat greedy mom flying , and she did not enjoy the ride .
she told the court she experienced " cramps , delusions and psychosis " while she was stoned out of her mind .
her son , more the reticent type , simply said the situation was " screwed up . " the judge seemed to take it all in stride , telling the mother , who had sobered up by this time , that it was n't all that bad .
but at the same time , she fined the woman who baked the cake 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- on charges of negligent bodily harm . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch town fights dope tourism with " weed boulevard " a dutch town near germany wants to quell booming soft-drug tourism by creating a strip especially for smokers - outside city limits .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .

" some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .
soon researchers will be joining their ranks , hoping to make their picture of the era more complete . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countries agree to open world 's largest nazi victim archive eleven nations - including germany - that share custody of millions of files on victims of the nazis agreed tuesday to open the archives to researchers more than 60 years after world war ii .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind -lrb- right -rrb- shows former defense minister peter struck his plan the notch in the facade of the dresden museum - like a bolt of lightening - is an allusion to the unsoundness of this world , according to libeskind .
the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .
dresden wants to step away from the homage-paying collection it used to be and replace it will a fresh exhibition concept . the new approach means confronting the anthropological side of violence , said gorch pieken , project leader for the remade exhibit . " we examine not only governmental but also social implementation of violence and have attempted to place a cornerstone in the cultural history of violence , " he said .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .
that 's why i decided to insert a glass wedge through the front of the arsenal .

the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .
" and what happened to mr. al-masri as a result of gross executive misconduct must be remedied by our court which is why yesterday we filed an appeal with a higher court … asking that court not to ignore common sense - that to discuss in a court room what is being discussed all around the world will not harm national security . " al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there . ' terribly important case ' the case is currently being investigated in europe and is being watched around the world . " this is a terribly important case , to make sure the us respects its obligations both under our constitution , under international law and under our treaties , " wizner said .
" what the us did to khaled al-masri should make every american ashamed .
all that al-masri wants from our government is an acknowledgement of what happened , an explanation for why it happened and an apology . " tenet , who was director of the cia at the time of al-masri 's alleged kidnapping , and the cia have declined to comment on the case . al-masri deserves a remedy when ellis dismissed the case because he thought it would expose state secrets vital to the us war on terrorism , he still acknowledged that al-masri suffered injuries as a result of the us government 's mistake and deserves a remedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials are also looking into the case the aclu said the case has already played out in the media around the world and such a ruling gives the government too much power to act without oversight . " the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger . " aclu lawyers said they will take the case all the way to the supreme court if they have to in order to get al-masri what he wants . " at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .
" and what happened to mr. al-masri as a result of gross executive misconduct must be remedied by our court which is why yesterday we filed an appeal with a higher court … asking that court not to ignore common sense - that to discuss in a court room what is being discussed all around the world will not harm national security . " al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there . ' terribly important case ' the case is currently being investigated in europe and is being watched around the world . " this is a terribly important case , to make sure the us respects its obligations both under our constitution , under international law and under our treaties , " wizner said .
" what the us did to khaled al-masri should make every american ashamed .
all that al-masri wants from our government is an acknowledgement of what happened , an explanation for why it happened and an apology . " tenet , who was director of the cia at the time of al-masri 's alleged kidnapping , and the cia have declined to comment on the case . al-masri deserves a remedy when ellis dismissed the case because he thought it would expose state secrets vital to the us war on terrorism , he still acknowledged that al-masri suffered injuries as a result of the us government 's mistake and deserves a remedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials are also looking into the case the aclu said the case has already played out in the media around the world and such a ruling gives the government too much power to act without oversight . " the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger . " aclu lawyers said they will take the case all the way to the supreme court if they have to in order to get al-masri what he wants . " at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .
it does n't look like this is imminent . israel at any rate has found the appropriate jargon .
until the international force arrives , it says it will see to calm and order itself .
that is : carry on as it has been . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ceasefire and troops on the table at rome conference world leaders are converging on rome before an emergency conference aimed at stopping nearly two weeks of israeli-lebanese violence .

the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .
" and what happened to mr. al-masri as a result of gross executive misconduct must be remedied by our court which is why yesterday we filed an appeal with a higher court … asking that court not to ignore common sense - that to discuss in a court room what is being discussed all around the world will not harm national security . " al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there . ' terribly important case ' the case is currently being investigated in europe and is being watched around the world . " this is a terribly important case , to make sure the us respects its obligations both under our constitution , under international law and under our treaties , " wizner said .
" what the us did to khaled al-masri should make every american ashamed .

" tenet , who was director of the cia at the time of al-masri 's alleged kidnapping , and the cia have declined to comment on the case . al-masri deserves a remedy when ellis dismissed the case because he thought it would expose state secrets vital to the us war on terrorism , he still acknowledged that al-masri suffered injuries as a result of the us government 's mistake and deserves a remedy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials are also looking into the case the aclu said the case has already played out in the media around the world and such a ruling gives the government too much power to act without oversight . " the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger . " aclu lawyers said they will take the case all the way to the supreme court if they have to in order to get al-masri what he wants . " at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

one of their major tasks is preparing the population for the upcoming elections .
dw-world.de spoke to caritas ' congo director bruno miteyo . at least half of the democratic republic of congo 's 60 million people are catholic and the church is very influential in this nation the size of western europe .
the german catholic aid organization caritas has been active in congo since 1994 .
bruno miteyo heads the country 's office in kinshasa . dw-world.de : on sunday , congo will hold the first free elections in over 40 years .
how have caritas and other catholic aid organizations helped people prepare for these elections ? bruno miteyo : the work of caritas is the work of the church .
our bishop 's conference in congo decided to train and educate people in the spirit of transition and to accompany them to this election .
for the last two years , we have been all over the country .
the catholic church is very popular here .
we have parishes , churches and many different communities .
we have been training people how to go to the elections , what to do and now , we are almost at the end of this transition period .
now , the elections are coming . what about humanitarian work ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of congolese have lost their homes in the past decade we work especially in the area of emergency measures .
we are one country in africa , which has faced a major catastrophe .
during the last 10 years , 3.8 million people have died because of the war and because of the intolerance .
more than 2.5 million people are internally displaced .
they are running through the country and do n't have anything .
so , caritas and other aid organizations are trying to give them support , food and medicine in order to give those people who are suffering a small sense of dignity . the catholic church has an extensive presence in the democratic republic of congo .
how does caritas benefit from the church 's infrastructure ? the catholic church has been involved in all the infrastructure in health , in schools and in small factories .
but now , much of it has been destroyed by the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the country 's infrastructure needs to be rebuilt the minimum infrastructure you can still find out in the country comes from the catholic church .
we now have more than 1,000 observers for the election throughout the country .
they can take advantage of this infrastructure .
and the population across the country knows that the small support that can be given comes from the catholic church . the catholic church in congo criticized election preparations last week , citing fears of manipulation .
what is your impression of the feeling among the people about the elections on sunday ? first of all , everybody would like to vote .
there is nobody in this country who does n't want to go to the elections .
it is a wish for everybody .
there is the feeling , though , that we are going to this election , but we do n't see clearly where we are going .
that 's why the bishop 's conference said that there needs to be a minimum of conditions to go to the election .
what kind of conditions ?
we need transparency .
we need to clarify some things , which are not clear .
we need to go to the polls with the feeling of people facing a big challenge in order to get democracy , to have leaders who are going to lead the people , who are going to set up a good government .
but there is something that is n't clear and we need to clarify that . sabina casagrande interviewed bruno miteyo send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de distrust of european troops grows in congo when congo holds its first democratic elections in 40 years at the end of the month , european troops will be on hand to guarantee safety and stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.07.2006 opinion : united states is doing too little , too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice took her time to sit down for talks in the middle east the conference in rome on wednesday wants to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .
then , she basically limited herself to assuring lebanon humanitarian aid and support in rebuilding . it 's too little , too late - this must be the clear message her visit has left on the lebanese . but could more have realistically been expected ?
hardly .
the government in washington made it clear from the beginning that it did n't only fully understand israel 's motives , but that it was also willing to coordinate with jerusalem its agenda for solution attempts . washi n gto n gave israel more time sure enough , washington started floundering just as much as jerusalem .
the duration of the israeli military operations in lebanon were initially forecast to last " several days , " then " several weeks . "
and before they concluded , washington did n't want to talk about either a ceasefire or the deployment of international troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli ground forces are pushing deeper into lebanon but in order not to stifle all hopes for an end to the violence , the us secretary of state brought both points into play - combined with the declaration that possible solutions would be talked about at the international conference in rome on wednesday . as positive as this may sound , it gave israel a couple of days more to attain its war goal : destroying hezbollah .
it is a goal which everyone - in particular israel - should know ca n't be achieved in such a short period .
israel like no other country has respective experience in southern lebanon , after all .
it has already once had to experience how a military campaign turned into an 18-year occupation . un deaths could speed up decisio n process another incident that has repeated itself : just as israeli artillery killed lebanese refugees in the un camp kafr qana in november 1996 , israelis now bombed a well-known post of un observers in southern lebanon , killing four blue helmets .
whether kofi annan 's charges of deliberate action or israel 's expression of regret apply ultimately remains unimportant .
the incident makes clear that an international deployment in southern lebanon would have to look different than up till now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can lebanon return to normality ?
how it will look and who should and will take part in it with which mandate is supposed to be decided at the meeting in rome on wednesday .
the participants ' opinions so far have diverged greatly from one another .
but maybe the death of the un observers will speed up the decision process , after the death of hundreds of civilians and the flight of hundreds of thousands were n't able to do so . thereby , rome is n't a peace conference , but rather just the attempt to end the fighting and start a process of normalization in lebanon .
the planned international force is also not supposed to force calm and peace , but rather maintain it .
but in order for that to be the case , these first must step in .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .
" but i thought , why should the military building be hidden ?
germany is a modern democratic country .
germans have to accept their past and understand the military history museum as something positive .
that 's why i decided to insert a glass wedge through the front of the arsenal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind -lrb- right -rrb- shows former defense minister peter struck his plan the notch in the facade of the dresden museum - like a bolt of lightening - is an allusion to the unsoundness of this world , according to libeskind .
the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .
dresden wants to step away from the homage-paying collection it used to be and replace it will a fresh exhibition concept . the new approach means confronting the anthropological side of violence , said gorch pieken , project leader for the remade exhibit . " we examine not only governmental but also social implementation of violence and have attempted to place a cornerstone in the cultural history of violence , " he said .

but the museum will have to find a new message before it reopens . tanks , tin soldiers , uniforms , weapons of relations and the first german u-boot : the bundeswehr museum on dresden 's stauffenbergstrasse has everything one would expect from an exhibition on german military history .
however , the museum is far from meeting today 's didactic and architectural standards . to close this gap , the bundeswehr , germany 's army , is investing 35 million euros -lrb- $ 44.3 million -rrb- in renovating the landmarked building .
american architect and museum specialist daniel libeskind is responsible for redoing the austere structure , which had been used as a military museum under the nazis and later under the communist sed party . dresden is not libeskind 's first war museum .
he also designed the imperial war museum in manchester , which opened in 2002 . " germa n s have to accept their past " " when the contest for the museum renovation was announced , everyone expected that something would be built at the back side of the arsenal , " libeskind said .

the asymmetrical " v " is an enormous victory sign that points toward downtown dresden , which allied bombers utterly destroyed at the end of world war ii . visitors should take away the message that war causes horrible suffering , said museum director lieutenant franz-josef heuser . " the main goal is , of course , to prevent war and violence , " he said .
" but in this world you need a military to do that . " few exhibitio n s o n peacekeepi n g missio n s the prominently placed wedge also stands for flux , volte-face and total change , which heuser was open to , fortunately for libeskind 's plans .
the new museum is to represent not only the german army 's classic task of national defense , but also the paradigm shift that has taken place : the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping missions . " this is somewhat problematic for us at the moment , " heuser said .
" we do n't have many pieces to exhibit yet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind also designed the jewish museum in berlin to critics , the military history museum has been highly polished and well organized , but without a statement .

but so far , us efforts by secretary of state rice on this conflict have been meager , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would actually expect more from someone who wants to mediate and make peace .
first , us secretary of state condoleezza rice took over a week 's time to go to the middle east to speak to the parties involved in the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.07.2006 protocol signed to open nazi victims archives to researchers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the miles of files in the archive will soon be more accessible germany and seven other nations signed on wednesday an agreement which will open millions of files on the victims of the nazis to researchers .
previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .
rather it is frequently the grandchildren to ask for information , eager to learn more about their grandparents .
soon researchers will be joining their ranks , hoping to make their picture of the era more complete . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countries agree to open world 's largest nazi victim archive eleven nations - including germany - that share custody of millions of files on victims of the nazis agreed tuesday to open the archives to researchers more than 60 years after world war ii .

the judge had dismissed al-masri 's case because of a perceived risk to national security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european officials said there were hundreds of secret flights " in the us , the courts are the final protectors and final guarantors of individual rights and liberties , " benjamin wizner , al-masri 's aclu lawyer in new york , told dw-radio .
" and what happened to mr. al-masri as a result of gross executive misconduct must be remedied by our court which is why yesterday we filed an appeal with a higher court … asking that court not to ignore common sense - that to discuss in a court room what is being discussed all around the world will not harm national security . " al-masri is accusing the us of mistakenly identifying him as a terror suspect and abducting him in macedonia in december 2001 .
he alleges that he was drugged , beaten and flown by the cia to a prison in afghanistan , where he was held for five months before the us government flew him to albania and left him there .

" the idea that this case can not be litigated because of secrecy is even further undermined by the reports that are coming out of europe , " wizner said .
" the council of europe has publicly concluded that mr. al-masri was rendered by the cia .
there was an article in newspapers here last week that identified an eye witness who shared the prison with mr. al-masri in afghanistan .
the entire world knows what happened to mr. al-masri and it is fiction that litigation would expose any secrets of state .
what the us is really seeking to avoid here is embarrassment not danger .

" at this point , we are hoping that we get a chance to litigate this case , to move forward and perhaps even to reach a settlement with the government , " wizner said .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

" a ceasefire to end the bloodshed in the region " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable , " they said . the leaders also called on israel to exercise the " utmost restraint " and welcomed israel 's decision to let aid into lebanon on flights to beirut airport . but the ceasefire pledge fell far short of meeting un secretary general kofi annan 's plea for an " immediate cessation of hostilities . " sustainable ceasefire us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire backed by many us allies in europe and the middle east , saying root causes of the violence needed to be addressed first . " we are all agreed that we want most urgently to end the violence on a basis that this time will be sustainable .
because , unfortunately , this is a region that has had too many broken ceasefires , " she said . " we do have a way forward , " rice added , referring to un resolution 1559 , which calls for the disarming and disbanding of all militias , including hezbollah , and for the lebanese government to assert its authority over all its territory .
much of southern lebanon is controlled by hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , left , and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier the conference set out no concrete steps for implementing the un resolution , however . " we all committed to dedicated and urgent action to try to bring about an end to this violence that indeed would be sustainable and that would leave the lebanese government with the prospect of full control of its country , " rice said .
" we can not return to the status-quo . " lebanese express disappointment at outcome a disappointed lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , who had pressed for an immediate ceasefire , told a news conference that " some progress " had been made , but " much remains to be done . "
he had made an impassioned speech at the talks in which he asked : " is the value of human rights in lebanon less than that of citizens elsewhere ?
are we children of a lesser god ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un indian peacekeepers carry the body of their colleague the meeting was held just hours after an israeli air raid hit a un post in southern lebanon , killing four un observers .
the 15-day-old conflict has killed 418 people in lebanon and 42 israelis .
ministers held a minute 's silence for all the dead . " the death and destruction we have witnessed in the past two weeks including yesterday 's tragic killing of un peacekeepers compels this conference to send a strong message and to speak with one voice , " annan said at the meeting 's opening .
" a temporary cessation of hostilities would offer crucial hours and days for essential humanitarian tasks . " syria and iran 's role in mediation rice warned syria and iran that it was time for them to " make a choice " about their roles in middle east peace .
the international community would work to " try to gain an understanding from other states that they have responsibilities too " in ending the violence in lebanon , rice said . " syria has a responsibility , " rice said .
" and we are deeply concerned , as we have said , about the role of iran .
it is high time that people make a choice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands are fleeing southern lebanon the us secretary of state said ministers had agreed to make urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian situation .
" we will continue to work with the united nations and with all to alleviate the suffering of the lebanese people , " she said . an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there was much discussion at the talks about the deployment of an international buffer force to guarantee lasting security in southern lebanon .
most countries at the conference have backed the idea of a buffer force , but there are differences over its composition and the conditions under which it should be deployed . " the mandate of the security force will be discussed over the next several days , " rice told journalists in rome .
" we have asked for urgent meetings to take place so that a force can be put together . " germans continue troop debate in germany , cabinet ministers debated the situation and germany ’ s possible contribution towards defusing the conflict .
chancellor angela merkel expressed her regrets over the killing of the four un peacekeepers and welcomed israel 's decision to look into the incident . a public debate continued here about the usefulness of a un-mandated peacekeeping mission .
former bundeswehr general hermann hagena claimed that an efficient mission in the region would require between 30,000 and 40,000 troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un supplies are traveling to beirut such a contingent would be needed , he said , since no one knows the real strength of hezbollah .
if the stabilization force were to disarm the militia in southern lebanon , it would entail house-to-house searches and require large numbers of soldiers . the debate also entails the sensitive issue of whether german troops should be involved in such a mission .
the central council of jews in germany advised against it . " just imagine a german soldier having to shoot at an israeli one , " said stephan kramer , the council 's general secretary .
" i think we shouldn ’ t make such a situation possible in the first place .
my advice would be to steer clear of such an involvement .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .
to date , only records of a non-personal nature - such as general information on concentration camps , forced labor or military records - have been accessible for historical research . i n terest still high still in the foreground is the tracing service , which even six decades after the end of the war receives tens of thousands of requests annually , according to bad arolsen officials .
in 2005 , 150,828 people asked the tracing service for help . the service was originally conceived as a temporary institute , but the passage of time has shown that the doors are not closing anytime soon .
right now , the institute is preparing to digitalize its files to make the growing demand for access easier . but employees in bad arolsen say they are somewhat surprised that the interest in the collection has grown recently , since today there are fewer and fewer survivors who need documentation to show government authorities .

previously they were only open to the victims and immediate family . the cabinets containing the card index boxes reach the ceiling and fill three rooms .
on the cards themselves are the names of more than 17 million victims of national socialism and information about where documents relating to the individuals can be located .
put in a single row , these documents would cover a length of about 26 kilometers -lrb- 16 miles -rrb- - it 's the most comprehensive collection of its type in the world . however , the international tracing service in the town of bad arolsen in hesse is no holocaust museum . " some of these victims would be found among our files , but the international tracing service was created to collect , hold and analyze documents of the victims of national socialism , " said udo jost , who coordinates document categorization at the center .
" those are of course not only victims of the holocaust , but also those who were imprisoned due to political , racial or religious reasons in the various prisons , concentration camps and the like . " for years , researchers , such as the director of the buchenwald memorial , have tried to gain access to the immense file collection , which includes " transfer lists , " such as oscar schindler 's famous one .
but until now , these records were closed to all but the survivors of nazi crimes or their close relatives . loose n i n g restrictio n s now , 61 years after the end of world war ii and the liberation of the nazi concentration camps , this restrictive policy is coming to an end .
the federal government has agreed on opening the files to researchers and the international committee , made up of 11 countries , has also given the green light .
once signed , the protocol still needs to be ratified by all signatory states before the archives can be opened . the " bonn treaty , " signed in 1955 , gave the panel responsibility for overseeing the international tracing service , which is an arm of the geneva-based international committee of the red cross .
the body actually decided to open the archive in 1998 , but could not agree on implementing the process until now , largely due to the difficulty of coming up with unified rules on access .
there were also concerns about protecting the interests of victims and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documents are often chilling " there were different views on these issues because there are different rules in the 11 countries involved , " jost said . on may 16 , 11 states - israel , the us , france , belgium , britain , greece , luxembourg , the netherlands , italy , poland and germany - agreed to open up on the archive while taking into consideration the protection of personal data .
eight of those nations signed the accord on wednesday , including germany , israel and the us .
three others are expected to sign later . the rules on access to the files have now been put in place .
information that refers to medical conditions or political orientation and data that was often invented by the nazis to justify an individual 's imprisonment will remain largely protected .
those protections are especially strict if the person concerned is still living . from the beginning , the international tracing service has stressed that the interests of the victims have priority over the data 's historical value or media inquiries .

the insurance fraud bureau -lrb- ifb -rrb- , to be headed by a former top policeman , will share intelligence with police forces and government .
initially , ifb staff are expected to scour 160 million insurance policies for signs of potential fraud , such as staged accidents or arson .
estimates put insurance fraud at £ 1.5bn a year , adding 5 % to average premiums .
better detection of late , it seems insurers are getting better at detecting fraud .
the growth in organised fraud needs a new approach stephen sklaroff , association of british insurers last year , the association of british insurers -lrb- abi -rrb- - which is backing the launch of the ifb - said that almost £ 400m of fraud was detected .
the figure is an increase of 50 % on the previous year .
some insurers have been turning to new technology , such as voice stress analysis , to counter bogus claims lodged over the telephone .
these sort of tactics have helped in the detection of opportunistic fraud such as people lodging excessive claims for damages .
organised gangs the ifb , though , will be targeting organised gangs of fraudsters , who - evidence suggests - use their ill-gotten gains to fund crimes such as drug dealing .
" the growth in organised fraud needs a new approach , " said stephen sklaroff , deputy director general of the abi .
" the launch of the ifb shows the industry 's determination to expose the organised criminal gangs who often use insurance payouts to fund other crimes , and put lives in danger . "
common types of fraud the ifb will be investigating include : staged motor accidents - fraudsters deliberately stage an accident with an innocent motorist so to put in an insurance claim fake disability - bogus personal injury claims to hoodwink insurers into paying-out cash to secure state benefits arson - business owners burning down their premises for the insurance cash .
court action the ifb will be headed by ex-new scotland yard detective john beadle , and its £ 1.7m costs will be funded by a levy on insurers .
information gathered by the ifb will be shared with police and government agencies , such as the department for work and pensions .
ifb staff will analyse data from across the insurance industry , using sophisticated computer software it will then alert insurers when it believes an organised fraud is taking place and an investigation will be launched .
ultimately , the abi said , the aim of the ifb was to bring gangs of fraudsters in front of the courts .
the public will be encouraged to shop fraudsters by phoning the ifb cheatline on 0800 328 2550 .

a mite is attacking the honey bees while nearly half of the island 's bumblebees species are in serious decline and several of them face extinction .
this is all due to changes in farming practices and the explosion of development over the past 30 years .
philip mccabe is one of ireland 's best known bee-keepers with colonies north and south of the border .
he keeps a close eye on his bees monitoring their progress as they convert nectar extracted from flowers into honey .
and all done in the presence of the queen bee , this one has a drop of white paint on her .
it is estimated that 60 % of ireland 's bees are wild but they face a new threat , the varroa mite .
it was first found in asia over 100 years ago but has now spread to ireland .
mr mccabe said : " it is the worst thing that has happened in ireland - ever .
" it sucks up the blood from the honey bee and kills them so beekeepers who do n't look after -lrb- them -rrb- their bees will be wiped out if they do n't learn how to manage it . "
research is under way into organic ways of dealing with the mite .
in the meantime , bee keepers are advised to use varroa screen floors .
but it is not just honey bees that are under threat , so too are bumblebees .
ireland 's hedges and meadows used to support 18 species now surveys are only regularly finding three .
why ?
because hedges are being cut down for new houses , new roads and bigger fields for farming .
anja murray , an ecologist with an taisce , the irish equivalent of the national trust , says it would be a terrible pity if children in the future only learn about bumble bees by reading history books .
she said : " agriculture is becoming more intensive , we are having early cuts of silage .
it is a change in production and so we are contacting the soil and there is not the habitat for the bumblebees to live any more . "

a mite is attacking the honey bees while nearly half of the island 's bumblebees species are in serious decline and several of them face extinction .
the humble bumble bee is in decline this is all due to changes in farming practices and the explosion of development over the past 30 years .
philip mccabe is one of ireland 's best known bee-keepers with colonies north and south of the border .
he keeps a close eye on his bees monitoring their progress as they convert nectar extracted from flowers into honey .
and all done in the presence of the queen bee , this one has a drop of white paint on her .
it is estimated that 60 % of ireland 's bees are wild but they face a new threat , the varroa mite .
it was first found in asia over 100 years ago but has now spread to ireland .
phillip mccabe has colonies on both sides of the border mr mccabe said : " it is the worst thing that has happened in ireland - ever .
" it sucks up the blood from the honey bee and kills them so beekeepers who do n't look after -lrb- them -rrb- their bees will be wiped out if they do n't learn how to manage it . "
research is under way into organic ways of dealing with the mite .
in the meantime , bee keepers are advised to use varroa screen floors .
but it is not just honey bees that are under threat , so too are bumblebees .
ireland 's hedges and meadows used to support 18 species now surveys are only regularly finding three .
why ?
because hedges are being cut down for new houses , new roads and bigger fields for farming .
anja murray , an ecologist with an taisce , the irish equivalent of the national trust , says it would be a terrible pity if children in the future only learn about bumble bees by reading history books .
she said : " agriculture is becoming more intensive , we are having early cuts of silage .
it is a change in production and so we are contacting the soil and there is not the habitat for the bumblebees to live any more . "

the law says a person wishing to convert and the priest conducting the ceremony will have to inform the authorities in advance .
religious minorities and human right groups have opposed the law saying it seeks to appease radical hindu groups .
in may , the pope condemned attempts to ban religious conversions in india .
the new law provides for a year in prison and cash fines to the person who converts and the priest who conducts the ceremony without informing the authorities .
the existing law on religious conversion in madhya pradesh passed in 1968 does not seek any such information and does not include priests in its ambit .
attacks the bbc 's faisal mohammed ali in bhopal says conversion is a major political issue in the state with the right-wing hindu political parties accusing christian missionaries of converting tribal people and low caste hindus through " force and allurement " .
christian groups say the new law is " clearly directed against the church " - the punishment for the priests who do not inform authorities about a conversion ceremony is stiffer than of the person who converts .
a spokesperson for the catholic council of bishops , father anand muttungal , said the new law will increase " moral policing " by right-wing hindu groups and " lead to more communal tension " .

the pop programme has been running for 42 years , and in its time has seen off competition from dozens of imitators and impostors .
you can find about more about the ups and downs of pop music on uk television by clicking on the links below .

the hit parade 3 .
juke box jury 5 .
the old grey whistle test 7 .
the roxy 9 .
cd : uk 2 .
six-five special 4 .
ready , steady , go ! 6 .
the tube 8 .
the chart show 10 .
top of the pops the hit parade - 1952 the hit parade was broadcast from studio g at lime grove the hit parade was described in the radio times as " the most ambitious attempt yet made to present popular music on the screen in a directly visual way " .
curiously , this meant dramatising the lyrics of hit songs through the medium of dance , perhaps providing an early inspiration for pan 's people .
rather than feature the recording stars of the day , the show recreated popular songs with the help of a house band , featuring a pre-downtown petula clark .
it was first transmitted by the bbc in january 1952 , pre-dating the creation of the uk singles chart by several months .
return to the top of the page six-five special - 1957-1958 teenagers danced to pop , rock , jazz and skiffle on the programme launched in february 1957 , six-five special got its name from its time slot - five past six on a saturday evening .
the programme revolutionised music television by showing its audience of teenagers jiving to the music - reportedly against the wishes of the bbc .
it opened each week with a film of a steam train , before presenter pete murray declared : " it 's time to jive on the old six-five ! "
featured artists included marty wilde , michael holliday and even spike milligan .
producer jack good eventually left for itv and created oh boy ! , the music show that introduced cliff richard to the world .
return to the top of the page juke box jury - 1959-1967 the judges included recording artists like mel torme -lrb- second right -rrb- perhaps the least visually stimulating pop programme of all time , juke box jury was nonetheless incredibly popular .
a forerunner to pop idol , the show asked guests to judge whether the week 's new singles would be hits or misses .
while the songs were being played , the cameras focused on the panel - who invariably adopted the pose of people concentrating very hard on a maths exam .
the audience would also tap their feet politely .
some excitement occurred in 1963 , however , when the beatles took part in the programme .
they correctly identified the swinging blue jeans ' hippy hippy shake and elvis presley 's kiss me quick as hits , accompanied by deafening screams from the audience .
the format was revived twice for the video era , with noel edmonds in 1979 and jools holland in 1989 .
return to the top of the page ready , steady , go ! - 1963-1966 dusty springfield presented early editions of the pop show " the weekend starts here , " promised ready steady go ! , which went out on itv every friday evening during the halcyon years of british rock .
capturing the exuberance and attitude of the swinging sixties in a way that the more straight-laced top of the pops never managed , the programme 's guest list reads like a who 's who of classic pop .
the beatles , the rolling stones , marvin gaye and the beach boys all made appearances , and the show 's warm-up act was gary glitter .
the regular hosts were fuddy-duddy dad keith fordyce , a dj and local councillor for wimbledon , and gushing teen cathy mcgowan .
plucked from obscurity to be a " teenage advisor " on the programme , mcgowan became known as queen of the mods , and even launched her own fashion label .
the programme petered out along with the mod scene in 1966 .
the last episode was called ready steady goes !
return to the top of the page the old grey whistle test - 1971-1985 the ' starkicker ' character in the title sequence became famous in the era of the concept album , rock music needed a programme that was n't just about screaming teenagers and three-minute singles .
the old grey whistle test was that programme .
as the last programme shown on bbc two on a friday night , it was allowed to extend its running time if a band became engrossed in a particularly awesome guitar solo .
despite its associations with prog rock , however , whistle test also found time to feature acts like the pet shop boys , bb king and the eurythmics .
according to long-standing presenter " whispering " bob harris , the show 's name was inspired by the doormen , known as " old greys " , who worked outside the music publishing companies in london 's denmark street .
if they could remember a new song after hearing it only once , it was said to have passed the old grey whistle test .
return to the top of the page the tube - 1982-1987 the tube made paula yates -lrb- left -rrb- a household name the most influential pop programme of the 1980s , the tube was the first place many people saw acts like frankie goes to hollywood , rem and madonna .
launched in channel 4 's opening week , the programme was filmed in a newcastle studio set up to look like a nightclub .
to adults , the tube must have seemed like the televisual representation of a migraine , but for teenagers it was compelling and edgy - a kaleidoscopic mixture of live music , fashion and comedy .
by 1987 , however , it had run out of steam .
child actor felix howard was given a presenting job , seemingly on the strength that he had been in madonna 's open your heart video .
but it was long-term presenter jools holland who got the programme taken off the air when he uttered an expletive during a live trail on children 's television .
the tube returned after three weeks , but it never fully recovered .
return to the top of the page the roxy - 1987-1988 the roxy was presented by david " kid " jensen itv 's disastrous mid-80s riposte to top of the pops was also filmed in newcastle .
the format owed a lot to its bbc rival , featuring music videos , live performances and a rundown of the chart .
presented by former bbc radio 1 dj david " kid " jensen , the programme had a run of bad luck .
in many regions , it suffered from being scheduled against eastenders .
then , at the end of 1987 , an industrial dispute at itv made live performances impossible .
the programme achieved a certain amount of notoriety when vanessa paradis sang joe le taxi in a see-through costume , but it was cancelled after only eight months .
return to the top of the page the chart show - 1986-1998 robert palmer 's addicted to love was the first and last video to be played on the chart show a direct response to the success of mtv , the chart show featured only music videos and replaced presenters with computer graphics .
in an effort to convey the sheer excitement of pop music , the programme was set in an animated funfair .
the top 10 countdown , for example , took place on a rollercoaster - because songs went up and down .
the chart show started life on channel 4 in 1986 , replacing the tube during a summer break , and later transferred to itv .
in 1998 , the show was axed to make way for ant and dec 's new saturday morning venture , cd : uk .
the company behind the chart show now produces channel 4 's b4 music video show .
return to the top of the page cd : uk - 1998-2006 ant , dec and cat also hosted the children 's programme sm : tv cd : uk was an hour long sugar rush of pre-packaged pop designed to shock sleepy teenagers into action on saturday mornings .
presenters ant and dec - together with cat deeley - were in charge , frequently collapsing into fits of laughter as they introduced acts like billie piper , s club 7 and britney spears .
they always seemed more interested in oasis and u2 , but the piercing screams that greeted every westlife performance dictated that the programme focused squarely on the school disco market .
occasionally that meant trouble , as when christina aguilera turned up in nothing but leather chaps and underwear - prompting a raft of complaints from parents .
the show lost some of its spark when ant and dec jumped ship in 2001 , and deeley followed suit in 2005 .
cd : uk struggled on with new presenters until april 2006 when it was ignominiously replaced with a cookery programme .
it has been reported the show will re-appear on five later this year .
return to the top of the page top of the pops - 1964-2006 totp had 65 presenters , including jayne middlemiss " all of these songs sound the same , " was the eternal cry of parents watching top of the pops over the last 42 years .
but , despite their complaints , they never quite managed to leave the room - always holding on to see who was at number one .
initially , the programme had a strict rule about miming - it was compulsory .
records would be visibly placed on a turntable before the artist launched into their performance .
the rule was scrapped , reinstated , fudged and eventually abandoned , but one thing about top of the pops remained constant - its representation of the uk 's eclectic taste in music .
in one 1977 edition , for example , bob marley appeared alongside combine harvester enthusiasts the wurzels .
what the reggae legend thought of the west country novelty act is , unfortunately , lost to history .

top of the pops the hit parade - 1952 the hit parade was broadcast from studio g at lime grove the hit parade was described in the radio times as " the most ambitious attempt yet made to present popular music on the screen in a directly visual way " .
curiously , this meant dramatising the lyrics of hit songs through the medium of dance , perhaps providing an early inspiration for pan 's people .
rather than feature the recording stars of the day , the show recreated popular songs with the help of a house band , featuring a pre-downtown petula clark .
it was first transmitted by the bbc in january 1952 , pre-dating the creation of the uk singles chart by several months .
return to the top of the page six-five special - 1957-1958 teenagers danced to pop , rock , jazz and skiffle on the programme launched in february 1957 , six-five special got its name from its time slot - five past six on a saturday evening .
the programme revolutionised music television by showing its audience of teenagers jiving to the music - reportedly against the wishes of the bbc .
it opened each week with a film of a steam train , before presenter pete murray declared : " it 's time to jive on the old six-five ! "
featured artists included marty wilde , michael holliday and even spike milligan .
producer jack good eventually left for itv and created oh boy ! , the music show that introduced cliff richard to the world .
return to the top of the page juke box jury - 1959-1967 the judges included recording artists like mel torme -lrb- second right -rrb- perhaps the least visually stimulating pop programme of all time , juke box jury was nonetheless incredibly popular .
a forerunner to pop idol , the show asked guests to judge whether the week 's new singles would be hits or misses .
while the songs were being played , the cameras focused on the panel - who invariably adopted the pose of people concentrating very hard on a maths exam .
the audience would also tap their feet politely .
some excitement occurred in 1963 , however , when the beatles took part in the programme .
they correctly identified the swinging blue jeans ' hippy hippy shake and elvis presley 's kiss me quick as hits , accompanied by deafening screams from the audience .
the format was revived twice for the video era , with noel edmonds in 1979 and jools holland in 1989 .
return to the top of the page ready , steady , go ! - 1963-1966 dusty springfield presented early editions of the pop show " the weekend starts here , " promised ready steady go ! , which went out on itv every friday evening during the halcyon years of british rock .
capturing the exuberance and attitude of the swinging sixties in a way that the more straight-laced top of the pops never managed , the programme 's guest list reads like a who 's who of classic pop .
the beatles , the rolling stones , marvin gaye and the beach boys all made appearances , and the show 's warm-up act was gary glitter .
the regular hosts were fuddy-duddy dad keith fordyce , a dj and local councillor for wimbledon , and gushing teen cathy mcgowan .
plucked from obscurity to be a " teenage advisor " on the programme , mcgowan became known as queen of the mods , and even launched her own fashion label .
the programme petered out along with the mod scene in 1966 .
the last episode was called ready steady goes !
return to the top of the page the old grey whistle test - 1971-1985 the ' starkicker ' character in the title sequence became famous in the era of the concept album , rock music needed a programme that was n't just about screaming teenagers and three-minute singles .
the old grey whistle test was that programme .
as the last programme shown on bbc two on a friday night , it was allowed to extend its running time if a band became engrossed in a particularly awesome guitar solo .
despite its associations with prog rock , however , whistle test also found time to feature acts like the pet shop boys , bb king and the eurythmics .
according to long-standing presenter " whispering " bob harris , the show 's name was inspired by the doormen , known as " old greys " , who worked outside the music publishing companies in london 's denmark street .
if they could remember a new song after hearing it only once , it was said to have passed the old grey whistle test .
return to the top of the page the tube - 1982-1987 the tube made paula yates -lrb- left -rrb- a household name the most influential pop programme of the 1980s , the tube was the first place many people saw acts like frankie goes to hollywood , rem and madonna .
launched in channel 4 's opening week , the programme was filmed in a newcastle studio set up to look like a nightclub .
to adults , the tube must have seemed like the televisual representation of a migraine , but for teenagers it was compelling and edgy - a kaleidoscopic mixture of live music , fashion and comedy .
by 1987 , however , it had run out of steam .
child actor felix howard was given a presenting job , seemingly on the strength that he had been in madonna 's open your heart video .
but it was long-term presenter jools holland who got the programme taken off the air when he uttered an expletive during a live trail on children 's television .
the tube returned after three weeks , but it never fully recovered .
return to the top of the page the roxy - 1987-1988 the roxy was presented by david " kid " jensen itv 's disastrous mid-80s riposte to top of the pops was also filmed in newcastle .
the format owed a lot to its bbc rival , featuring music videos , live performances and a rundown of the chart .
presented by former bbc radio 1 dj david " kid " jensen , the programme had a run of bad luck .
in many regions , it suffered from being scheduled against eastenders .
then , at the end of 1987 , an industrial dispute at itv made live performances impossible .
the programme achieved a certain amount of notoriety when vanessa paradis sang joe le taxi in a see-through costume , but it was cancelled after only eight months .

in an effort to convey the sheer excitement of pop music , the programme was set in an animated funfair .
the top 10 countdown , for example , took place on a rollercoaster - because songs went up and down .
the chart show started life on channel 4 in 1986 , replacing the tube during a summer break , and later transferred to itv .
in 1998 , the show was axed to make way for ant and dec 's new saturday morning venture , cd : uk .

return to the top of the page cd : uk - 1998-2006 ant , dec and cat also hosted the children 's programme sm : tv cd : uk was an hour long sugar rush of pre-packaged pop designed to shock sleepy teenagers into action on saturday mornings .
presenters ant and dec - together with cat deeley - were in charge , frequently collapsing into fits of laughter as they introduced acts like billie piper , s club 7 and britney spears .
they always seemed more interested in oasis and u2 , but the piercing screams that greeted every westlife performance dictated that the programme focused squarely on the school disco market .
occasionally that meant trouble , as when christina aguilera turned up in nothing but leather chaps and underwear - prompting a raft of complaints from parents .
the show lost some of its spark when ant and dec jumped ship in 2001 , and deeley followed suit in 2005 .
cd : uk struggled on with new presenters until april 2006 when it was ignominiously replaced with a cookery programme .

initially , the programme had a strict rule about miming - it was compulsory .
records would be visibly placed on a turntable before the artist launched into their performance .
the rule was scrapped , reinstated , fudged and eventually abandoned , but one thing about top of the pops remained constant - its representation of the uk 's eclectic taste in music .

the pop programme has been running for 42 years , and in its time has seen off competition from dozens of imitators and impostors .
you can find about more about the ups and downs of pop music on uk television by clicking on the links below .

the chart show 10 .
top of the pops the hit parade - 1952 the hit parade was broadcast from studio g at lime grove the hit parade was described in the radio times as " the most ambitious attempt yet made to present popular music on the screen in a directly visual way " .
curiously , this meant dramatising the lyrics of hit songs through the medium of dance , perhaps providing an early inspiration for pan 's people .
rather than feature the recording stars of the day , the show recreated popular songs with the help of a house band , featuring a pre-downtown petula clark .
it was first transmitted by the bbc in january 1952 , pre-dating the creation of the uk singles chart by several months .
return to the top of the page six-five special - 1957-1958 teenagers danced to pop , rock , jazz and skiffle on the programme launched in february 1957 , six-five special got its name from its time slot - five past six on a saturday evening .
the programme revolutionised music television by showing its audience of teenagers jiving to the music - reportedly against the wishes of the bbc .
it opened each week with a film of a steam train , before presenter pete murray declared : " it 's time to jive on the old six-five ! "
featured artists included marty wilde , michael holliday and even spike milligan .
producer jack good eventually left for itv and created oh boy ! , the music show that introduced cliff richard to the world .
return to the top of the page juke box jury - 1959-1967 the judges included recording artists like mel torme -lrb- second right -rrb- perhaps the least visually stimulating pop programme of all time , juke box jury was nonetheless incredibly popular .
a forerunner to pop idol , the show asked guests to judge whether the week 's new singles would be hits or misses .
while the songs were being played , the cameras focused on the panel - who invariably adopted the pose of people concentrating very hard on a maths exam .
the audience would also tap their feet politely .
some excitement occurred in 1963 , however , when the beatles took part in the programme .
they correctly identified the swinging blue jeans ' hippy hippy shake and elvis presley 's kiss me quick as hits , accompanied by deafening screams from the audience .
the format was revived twice for the video era , with noel edmonds in 1979 and jools holland in 1989 .
return to the top of the page ready , steady , go ! - 1963-1966 dusty springfield presented early editions of the pop show " the weekend starts here , " promised ready steady go ! , which went out on itv every friday evening during the halcyon years of british rock .
capturing the exuberance and attitude of the swinging sixties in a way that the more straight-laced top of the pops never managed , the programme 's guest list reads like a who 's who of classic pop .
the beatles , the rolling stones , marvin gaye and the beach boys all made appearances , and the show 's warm-up act was gary glitter .
the regular hosts were fuddy-duddy dad keith fordyce , a dj and local councillor for wimbledon , and gushing teen cathy mcgowan .
plucked from obscurity to be a " teenage advisor " on the programme , mcgowan became known as queen of the mods , and even launched her own fashion label .
the programme petered out along with the mod scene in 1966 .
the last episode was called ready steady goes !
return to the top of the page the old grey whistle test - 1971-1985 the ' starkicker ' character in the title sequence became famous in the era of the concept album , rock music needed a programme that was n't just about screaming teenagers and three-minute singles .
the old grey whistle test was that programme .
as the last programme shown on bbc two on a friday night , it was allowed to extend its running time if a band became engrossed in a particularly awesome guitar solo .
despite its associations with prog rock , however , whistle test also found time to feature acts like the pet shop boys , bb king and the eurythmics .
according to long-standing presenter " whispering " bob harris , the show 's name was inspired by the doormen , known as " old greys " , who worked outside the music publishing companies in london 's denmark street .
if they could remember a new song after hearing it only once , it was said to have passed the old grey whistle test .
return to the top of the page the tube - 1982-1987 the tube made paula yates -lrb- left -rrb- a household name the most influential pop programme of the 1980s , the tube was the first place many people saw acts like frankie goes to hollywood , rem and madonna .
launched in channel 4 's opening week , the programme was filmed in a newcastle studio set up to look like a nightclub .
to adults , the tube must have seemed like the televisual representation of a migraine , but for teenagers it was compelling and edgy - a kaleidoscopic mixture of live music , fashion and comedy .
by 1987 , however , it had run out of steam .
child actor felix howard was given a presenting job , seemingly on the strength that he had been in madonna 's open your heart video .
but it was long-term presenter jools holland who got the programme taken off the air when he uttered an expletive during a live trail on children 's television .
the tube returned after three weeks , but it never fully recovered .
return to the top of the page the roxy - 1987-1988 the roxy was presented by david " kid " jensen itv 's disastrous mid-80s riposte to top of the pops was also filmed in newcastle .
the format owed a lot to its bbc rival , featuring music videos , live performances and a rundown of the chart .
presented by former bbc radio 1 dj david " kid " jensen , the programme had a run of bad luck .
in many regions , it suffered from being scheduled against eastenders .
then , at the end of 1987 , an industrial dispute at itv made live performances impossible .
the programme achieved a certain amount of notoriety when vanessa paradis sang joe le taxi in a see-through costume , but it was cancelled after only eight months .

the us government currently oversees the net 's domain name system through the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- .
but at a hearing on wednesday a government official said the us was " committed " to the transition to private domain name control " .
however , a policy statement issued last year asserted the us would not give up overseeing domain names like .com.
these root domain names include .com , .net and .org. "
we remain committed to the private sector management of the domain name system " us government icann , a california-based not-for profit company , was given the task of coordinating and managing the domain name system in 1998 .
this includes the allocation of internet protocol numbers , the unique number given to every online device , as well as the assignment of domain names and deciding whether root-level names such as .com , .net or .org , can be added to the internet .
currently the us commerce department oversees icann , and any major changes to the domain name system need to be submitted for approval to the us commerce department .
but the deadline for the full privatisation of icann is 30 september 2006 , although the us department has the option to delay the hand-over , and the meeting on wednesday formed part of the public consultation to determine whether the company is ready to stand alone .
sea-change john kneuer , a representative of the us commerce department , told the meeting : " we remain committed to the private sector management of the domain name system . "
this seemed to mark a sea-change from a statement issued in june 2005 by the government that asserted the us intended to retain its control of top-level root domain names to preserve the security and stability of the net domain name system .

a number of the submissions stated : " no single government should have a pre-eminent role in internet governance . "

the us government currently oversees the net 's domain name system through the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- .
but at a hearing on wednesday a government official said the us was " committed " to the transition to private domain name control " .
however , a policy statement issued last year asserted the us would not give up overseeing domain names like .com.
these root domain names include .com , .net and .org.
we remain committed to the private sector management of the domain name system us government icann , a california-based not-for profit company , was given the task of coordinating and managing the domain name system in 1998 .
this includes the allocation of internet protocol numbers , the unique number given to every online device , as well as the assignment of domain names and deciding whether root-level names such as .com , .net or .org , can be added to the internet .
currently the us commerce department oversees icann , and any major changes to the domain name system need to be submitted for approval to the us commerce department .
but the deadline for the full privatisation of icann is 30 september 2006 , although the us department has the option to delay the hand-over , and the meeting on wednesday formed part of the public consultation to determine whether the company is ready to stand alone .
sea-change john kneuer , a representative of the us commerce department , told the meeting : " we remain committed to the private sector management of the domain name system . "
this seemed to mark a sea-change from a statement issued in june 2005 by the government that asserted the us intended to retain its control of top-level root domain names to preserve the security and stability of the net domain name system .
this caused consternation within the international community when it was announced ; with some countries stating they were concerned the us had too much control and suggesting that net oversight should shift to the united nations or another international organisation .
ultimately , we would like to see a private sector solution emily taylor , nominet and icann hit controversy again in may 2006 , when it rejected a plan for a new .xxx domain name , for sexually explicit sites , a move that some condemned as politically motivated .
almost 700 people from around the world submitted written evidence to the hearing .
a number of the submissions stated : " no single government should have a pre-eminent role in internet governance . "
while margarita valdes , president of the latin american and caribbean top level domain organization , wrote : " the us government needs to lessen its perceived and actual influence on day-to-day operations of icann and its role with the domain name system . "
transition time-line but others at the meeting said that while the aim should remain the full privatisation of icann , the company was not yet ready to become fully sustainable .
emily taylor , director of legal and policy at nominet , the uk internet name registry for domain names ending in .uk , spoke at the hearing .
she told the bbc news website : " i think , from our perspective , icann has done some good work , particularly in reforming the operation of the root .
" but -lsb- the transition -rsb- is all a question of timing .
we are reasonably relaxed about the timeframe .
we think the current system works well , and we do not really have an operational problem with the us government 's involvement .
" but , ultimately , we would like to see a private sector solution .
that was the original vision when icann was set up in 1998 .
" what was very positive from our point of view was that there was a renewed commitment from the department of commerce to transition to privatisation . "
the us government have said they will take the information from the meeting and the written submissions into account for their final verdict on icann 's status .
