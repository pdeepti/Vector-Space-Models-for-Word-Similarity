" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .
we are checking various pieces of information .
we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .
there are still no suspects . " one source accusations rebuffed by club and country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger is set to feature at the world cup schweinsteiger , 21 , is one of germany 's brightest prospects and a certainty to make jurgen klinsmann 's final squad for this summer 's world cup finals . the tz was the only media outlet to name him in connection with the investigation , although the rolling news channels gave high prominence to the report . the tz also named two players from the second division 1860 munich club , australian international paul agostino and dutchman quido lanzaat , in connection with the scandal . tz said all three players had been questioned by investigators . bayern munich general manager uli hoeness was enraged , saying schweinsteiger had told the club " he had never bet a euro on a match in his life " .
hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .
" i have nothing to do with it and my club have said the same thing .
i have never bet on a match involving my team before and will never do so in the future , " the dutchman said . it was unclear whether that betting referred to second and third division matches which are currently the subject of a criminal investigation being handled by prosecutors in the western city of frankfurt . with the world cup finals beginning on june 9 , host nation germany could face another match-fixing scandal just as it is shaking off an affair involving a referee who admitted fixing matches . in january 2005 , referee robert hoyzer , 26 , blew the lid on a match-fixing scandal when he admitted to fixing four matches for financial gain . the tainted official had been taking bribes from a croatian mafia circle based in berlin and he named and shamed others involved in the match-rigging ring . last november , hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in jail and another former referee , dominik marks , was given an 18-month suspended sentence .
hoyzer is currently appealing his sentence . berlin-based croat ante sapina was found guilty of masterminding the match-fixing operation and sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de allegations surface of star player involvement in new scandal a german sports magazine has claimed that bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in the illegal mafia betting scandal that is threatening germany 's world cup .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks .

" unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .

french youth are angry : for days , protests have swept across the country as young people demand better occupational conditions . demonstrators overturned cars and threw petrol bombs at police who repelled them with tear gas and water cannons , as a show of force by hundreds of thousands of french students against the government over job reforms turned increasingly violent on thursday . calm returned early friday after demonstrators clashed with police on paris 's place de la sorbonne square in the latin quarter following a protest march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot policemen arrest two protesters during clashes near the sorbonne university in paris protestors also vandalized cafés amid scenes that left the area veiled in tear gas fumes and a bookshop in flames on the square , located near departments of the sorbonne university . police said 46 officers were injured , including 11 hospitalized , in clashes in paris and incidents elsewhere in french towns including rennes and toulouse left several other officers hurt . interior minister claims current protestors are " copycats " interior minister nicolas sarkozy laid blame for the riots on militants ranging from the extreme left to the extreme right , and including " hooligans " and " louts " from suburbs of paris who had seen angry demonstrations earlier this year . " there were a few hundred delinquents who came to fight , " he told journalists after meeting police and firemen in central paris .
" among them there were extreme left , extreme right , hooligans , and louts from a number of neighbourhoods . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy blames riots on " hooligans " the protests were organized in anger at the proposed first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- , a contested youth jobs measure .
unions , student groups and the political left say the cpe , which can be broken off without explanation in the first two years , is a license to hire and fire at will , and are demanding its withdrawal . new job measure is causing the fuss prime minister dominique de villepin , who championed the scheme as a key tool in fighting youth unemployment , faces the most serious test of his premiership as the wave of protests paralyzes dozens of french universities .
the cpe is aimed at encouraging companies to recruit young people . the interior ministry said 257,000 people took to the streets in up to 80 towns and cities across france , while some organizers set the figure as high as half a million . student leaders said that 120,000 people joined the march through paris 's left bank university quarter , although police said there were 30,000 . france has a tradition of protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration last year against education reform plans large rallies were also held in marseille , lyon and grenoble in the south and southeast , bordeaux in the southwest , rennes and lille in the northwest and north , clermont-ferrand , limoges and angers in the centre and strasbourg in the east . four people were arrested in the southern city of toulouse after police dispersed a peaceful 9,000-strong protest . violence also erupted last week when riot police were called in to evacuate demonstrators from paris ' historic sorbonne university .
student leaders described the protest movement - which is backed by 68 percent of the public , according to a new poll - as a " tidal wave " . unions have called for a further day of protest on saturday , when the head of the powerful cgt union , bernard thibault , has vowed to " step up a gear " in the stand-off with the government . strikes and sit-ins have spread to two-thirds of france 's 84 universities with 21 closed and 37 others badly disrupted , according to the education ministry , with protests also reported in dozens of high schools . france has one of europe 's highest youth unemployment rates not all students back the protest movement , however , and clashes broke out in toulouse as dozens of youths angry at the disruption to their studies tried to dislodge protestors from the building . france has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in europe , with 23 percent of all young people out of work and the figure topping 50 percent in some of the high-immigration city suburbs hit by rioting late last year . villepin has said he was open to talks with labor leaders but insists the measure - passed by parliament as part of a broader law on equal opportunities drawn up after the riots in october and november - will be implemented . the escalating protests have revived memories of the may 1968 student uprising , and have been seen as the sign of a deeper malaise among young french people worried about their future . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curfews take heat out of riots but violence continues nightly violence flared again wednesday in riot-hit parts of france but the threat of emergency curfews appeared to have taken the edge off the urban unrest that has gripped the country for almost two weeks .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .
" it was a good game by both teams , " said us head coach greg rayn .

" there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .
we are checking various pieces of information .
we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .
there are still no suspects . " one source accusations rebuffed by club and country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger is set to feature at the world cup schweinsteiger , 21 , is one of germany 's brightest prospects and a certainty to make jurgen klinsmann 's final squad for this summer 's world cup finals . the tz was the only media outlet to name him in connection with the investigation , although the rolling news channels gave high prominence to the report . the tz also named two players from the second division 1860 munich club , australian international paul agostino and dutchman quido lanzaat , in connection with the scandal . tz said all three players had been questioned by investigators . bayern munich general manager uli hoeness was enraged , saying schweinsteiger had told the club " he had never bet a euro on a match in his life " .
hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .
" i have nothing to do with it and my club have said the same thing .
i have never bet on a match involving my team before and will never do so in the future , " the dutchman said . it was unclear whether that betting referred to second and third division matches which are currently the subject of a criminal investigation being handled by prosecutors in the western city of frankfurt . with the world cup finals beginning on june 9 , host nation germany could face another match-fixing scandal just as it is shaking off an affair involving a referee who admitted fixing matches . in january 2005 , referee robert hoyzer , 26 , blew the lid on a match-fixing scandal when he admitted to fixing four matches for financial gain . the tainted official had been taking bribes from a croatian mafia circle based in berlin and he named and shamed others involved in the match-rigging ring . last november , hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in jail and another former referee , dominik marks , was given an 18-month suspended sentence .
hoyzer is currently appealing his sentence . berlin-based croat ante sapina was found guilty of masterminding the match-fixing operation and sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de allegations surface of star player involvement in new scandal a german sports magazine has claimed that bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in the illegal mafia betting scandal that is threatening germany 's world cup .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .
" it was a good game by both teams , " said us head coach greg rayn .
" it think we played much better this year .
last year , i thought germany dominated the game and we were fortunate to score the goal and defend well .
i think in this match we were the aggressive team , attacking throughout the game . " the game was a rematch of last year 's final , which the world 's number-two-ranked american team won 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta carlson scores in germany 's successful european championship campaign as number one , the german women 's team , however , should get more of the limelight in the national public eye . german women soccer players have achieved what the men can only dream of : they 've won the european championships five times ; they won two olympic bronze medals in sydney and athens and in 2003 ; they won the world championship .
it makes the german team one of the most successful women 's national football teams in the world . but judging from the amount of money coming from sponsors , women players have an image problem .
and they have to put up with stereotypes : men ask women in soccer whether their fields are smaller or the matches are shorter or if the girls play with balls made from soft foam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls training with the german women 's team there was a time when men did n't like women to play football at all .
until 1970 , the german football federation banned women from playing professionally .
and although there is more acceptance of women players now , male dominance can still be seen in the structure of the federation : the decision-makers are mostly men .
there are women representatives , but usually only one per federation , if at all . some things have changed , however .
these days winning major competitions means cash prizes for women in football . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel strikes personal note in new year 's wishes to germans chancellor angela merkel issued a personal call to germans to dare to achieve more in the new year , and said her new government would set the best example .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2006 calls for more concrete eu action on belarus gather pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liberal leaders are urging the eu to back the opposition in the belarussian elections former and current eastern european liberal leaders called on the eu friday to support the liberal opposition candidates challenging belarusian president alexander lukashenko in a vote they said was certain to be fixed . georgian president mikhail saakashvili , brought to power by mass protests in 2003 , wrote in the international herald tribune that new sanctions were needed to put teeth into allegations that lukashenko crushed human rights and urged the west to take note of upheavals against electoral fraud that helped unseat governments in georgia and ukraine . the eu " will need to show leadership by publicly denouncing and not recognising the election and facilitating an eu-led negotiating forum for the two belarusian sides , " he wrote .
" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be .

" " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .

" paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .

" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

french youth are angry : for days , protests have swept across the country as young people demand better occupational conditions . demonstrators overturned cars and threw petrol bombs at police who repelled them with tear gas and water cannons , as a show of force by hundreds of thousands of french students against the government over job reforms turned increasingly violent on thursday . calm returned early friday after demonstrators clashed with police on paris 's place de la sorbonne square in the latin quarter following a protest march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot policemen arrest two protesters during clashes near the sorbonne university in paris protestors also vandalized cafés amid scenes that left the area veiled in tear gas fumes and a bookshop in flames on the square , located near departments of the sorbonne university . police said 46 officers were injured , including 11 hospitalized , in clashes in paris and incidents elsewhere in french towns including rennes and toulouse left several other officers hurt . interior minister claims current protestors are " copycats " interior minister nicolas sarkozy laid blame for the riots on militants ranging from the extreme left to the extreme right , and including " hooligans " and " louts " from suburbs of paris who had seen angry demonstrations earlier this year . " there were a few hundred delinquents who came to fight , " he told journalists after meeting police and firemen in central paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

unions , student groups and the political left say the cpe , which can be broken off without explanation in the first two years , is a license to hire and fire at will , and are demanding its withdrawal . new job measure is causing the fuss prime minister dominique de villepin , who championed the scheme as a key tool in fighting youth unemployment , faces the most serious test of his premiership as the wave of protests paralyzes dozens of french universities .
the cpe is aimed at encouraging companies to recruit young people . the interior ministry said 257,000 people took to the streets in up to 80 towns and cities across france , while some organizers set the figure as high as half a million . student leaders said that 120,000 people joined the march through paris 's left bank university quarter , although police said there were 30,000 . france has a tradition of protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration last year against education reform plans large rallies were also held in marseille , lyon and grenoble in the south and southeast , bordeaux in the southwest , rennes and lille in the northwest and north , clermont-ferrand , limoges and angers in the centre and strasbourg in the east . four people were arrested in the southern city of toulouse after police dispersed a peaceful 9,000-strong protest . violence also erupted last week when riot police were called in to evacuate demonstrators from paris ' historic sorbonne university .
student leaders described the protest movement - which is backed by 68 percent of the public , according to a new poll - as a " tidal wave " . unions have called for a further day of protest on saturday , when the head of the powerful cgt union , bernard thibault , has vowed to " step up a gear " in the stand-off with the government . strikes and sit-ins have spread to two-thirds of france 's 84 universities with 21 closed and 37 others badly disrupted , according to the education ministry , with protests also reported in dozens of high schools . france has one of europe 's highest youth unemployment rates not all students back the protest movement , however , and clashes broke out in toulouse as dozens of youths angry at the disruption to their studies tried to dislodge protestors from the building . france has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in europe , with 23 percent of all young people out of work and the figure topping 50 percent in some of the high-immigration city suburbs hit by rioting late last year . villepin has said he was open to talks with labor leaders but insists the measure - passed by parliament as part of a broader law on equal opportunities drawn up after the riots in october and november - will be implemented . the escalating protests have revived memories of the may 1968 student uprising , and have been seen as the sign of a deeper malaise among young french people worried about their future . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curfews take heat out of riots but violence continues nightly violence flared again wednesday in riot-hit parts of france but the threat of emergency curfews appeared to have taken the edge off the urban unrest that has gripped the country for almost two weeks .

" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .
we are checking various pieces of information .
we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .
there are still no suspects . " one source accusations rebuffed by club and country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger is set to feature at the world cup schweinsteiger , 21 , is one of germany 's brightest prospects and a certainty to make jurgen klinsmann 's final squad for this summer 's world cup finals . the tz was the only media outlet to name him in connection with the investigation , although the rolling news channels gave high prominence to the report . the tz also named two players from the second division 1860 munich club , australian international paul agostino and dutchman quido lanzaat , in connection with the scandal . tz said all three players had been questioned by investigators . bayern munich general manager uli hoeness was enraged , saying schweinsteiger had told the club " he had never bet a euro on a match in his life " .
hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .

french youth are angry : for days , protests have swept across the country as young people demand better occupational conditions . demonstrators overturned cars and threw petrol bombs at police who repelled them with tear gas and water cannons , as a show of force by hundreds of thousands of french students against the government over job reforms turned increasingly violent on thursday . calm returned early friday after demonstrators clashed with police on paris 's place de la sorbonne square in the latin quarter following a protest march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot policemen arrest two protesters during clashes near the sorbonne university in paris protestors also vandalized cafés amid scenes that left the area veiled in tear gas fumes and a bookshop in flames on the square , located near departments of the sorbonne university . police said 46 officers were injured , including 11 hospitalized , in clashes in paris and incidents elsewhere in french towns including rennes and toulouse left several other officers hurt . interior minister claims current protestors are " copycats " interior minister nicolas sarkozy laid blame for the riots on militants ranging from the extreme left to the extreme right , and including " hooligans " and " louts " from suburbs of paris who had seen angry demonstrations earlier this year . " there were a few hundred delinquents who came to fight , " he told journalists after meeting police and firemen in central paris .
" among them there were extreme left , extreme right , hooligans , and louts from a number of neighbourhoods . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy blames riots on " hooligans " the protests were organized in anger at the proposed first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- , a contested youth jobs measure .
unions , student groups and the political left say the cpe , which can be broken off without explanation in the first two years , is a license to hire and fire at will , and are demanding its withdrawal . new job measure is causing the fuss prime minister dominique de villepin , who championed the scheme as a key tool in fighting youth unemployment , faces the most serious test of his premiership as the wave of protests paralyzes dozens of french universities .
the cpe is aimed at encouraging companies to recruit young people . the interior ministry said 257,000 people took to the streets in up to 80 towns and cities across france , while some organizers set the figure as high as half a million . student leaders said that 120,000 people joined the march through paris 's left bank university quarter , although police said there were 30,000 . france has a tradition of protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration last year against education reform plans large rallies were also held in marseille , lyon and grenoble in the south and southeast , bordeaux in the southwest , rennes and lille in the northwest and north , clermont-ferrand , limoges and angers in the centre and strasbourg in the east . four people were arrested in the southern city of toulouse after police dispersed a peaceful 9,000-strong protest . violence also erupted last week when riot police were called in to evacuate demonstrators from paris ' historic sorbonne university .
student leaders described the protest movement - which is backed by 68 percent of the public , according to a new poll - as a " tidal wave " . unions have called for a further day of protest on saturday , when the head of the powerful cgt union , bernard thibault , has vowed to " step up a gear " in the stand-off with the government . strikes and sit-ins have spread to two-thirds of france 's 84 universities with 21 closed and 37 others badly disrupted , according to the education ministry , with protests also reported in dozens of high schools . france has one of europe 's highest youth unemployment rates not all students back the protest movement , however , and clashes broke out in toulouse as dozens of youths angry at the disruption to their studies tried to dislodge protestors from the building . france has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in europe , with 23 percent of all young people out of work and the figure topping 50 percent in some of the high-immigration city suburbs hit by rioting late last year . villepin has said he was open to talks with labor leaders but insists the measure - passed by parliament as part of a broader law on equal opportunities drawn up after the riots in october and november - will be implemented . the escalating protests have revived memories of the may 1968 student uprising , and have been seen as the sign of a deeper malaise among young french people worried about their future . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curfews take heat out of riots but violence continues nightly violence flared again wednesday in riot-hit parts of france but the threat of emergency curfews appeared to have taken the edge off the urban unrest that has gripped the country for almost two weeks .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration .

" " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated .

" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .
" it was a good game by both teams , " said us head coach greg rayn .
" it think we played much better this year .
last year , i thought germany dominated the game and we were fortunate to score the goal and defend well .
i think in this match we were the aggressive team , attacking throughout the game .

it makes the german team one of the most successful women 's national football teams in the world . but judging from the amount of money coming from sponsors , women players have an image problem .
and they have to put up with stereotypes : men ask women in soccer whether their fields are smaller or the matches are shorter or if the girls play with balls made from soft foam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls training with the german women 's team there was a time when men did n't like women to play football at all .
until 1970 , the german football federation banned women from playing professionally .
and although there is more acceptance of women players now , male dominance can still be seen in the structure of the federation : the decision-makers are mostly men .
there are women representatives , but usually only one per federation , if at all . some things have changed , however .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government .

" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .

we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team .

" the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .

hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2006 " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaved heads are no longer the identifying sign of the right-wing scene in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts . according to germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , throngs of youth people are still joining the german neo-nazi scene .
matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .
" it was a good game by both teams , " said us head coach greg rayn .
" it think we played much better this year .
last year , i thought germany dominated the game and we were fortunate to score the goal and defend well .
i think in this match we were the aggressive team , attacking throughout the game . " the game was a rematch of last year 's final , which the world 's number-two-ranked american team won 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta carlson scores in germany 's successful european championship campaign as number one , the german women 's team , however , should get more of the limelight in the national public eye . german women soccer players have achieved what the men can only dream of : they 've won the european championships five times ; they won two olympic bronze medals in sydney and athens and in 2003 ; they won the world championship .
it makes the german team one of the most successful women 's national football teams in the world . but judging from the amount of money coming from sponsors , women players have an image problem .
and they have to put up with stereotypes : men ask women in soccer whether their fields are smaller or the matches are shorter or if the girls play with balls made from soft foam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls training with the german women 's team there was a time when men did n't like women to play football at all .
until 1970 , the german football federation banned women from playing professionally .
and although there is more acceptance of women players now , male dominance can still be seen in the structure of the federation : the decision-makers are mostly men .
there are women representatives , but usually only one per federation , if at all . some things have changed , however .
these days winning major competitions means cash prizes for women in football . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel strikes personal note in new year 's wishes to germans chancellor angela merkel issued a personal call to germans to dare to achieve more in the new year , and said her new government would set the best example .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks . " wal-mart of black-market proliferation " the information first came to light when a german ship was intercepted in october 2003 carrying a cargo of containers filled with nuclear weapons technology headed for libya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi unexpectedly spilled the beans on the nuclear mafia in 2003 the seizure prompted a nervous gadhafi to disclose the names of all those who had supplied tripoli with material and expertise for its nuclear program .
that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

but according to political economist friedrich schneider , that 's partly due to hypocritical western governments , who do n't want to be team players .

the world 's first trial of an alleged member of the a.q. khan global nuclear mafia opens in mannheim friday .
it draws unwelcome attention to german firms ' roles in the illegal export of nuclear technology . a global black market for nuclear weapons , a shadowy network of masterminds and middlemen spanning continents and dictators ready to pay billions to get the bomb .
it may sound like the plot for a racy thriller , but it 's the very real backdrop to a trial that opened on friday in mannheim , where a german engineer and businessman has been charged with violating germany 's war weapons control act and foreign trade act . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdul qadeer khan also known as the father of the pakistani nuclear bomb the defendant , gotthard lerch , 63 , is the first alleged member of the global nuclear mafia led by discredited pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan to go on trial . the case relates to lerch 's role in 2000 in supplying libyan dictator moammar gadhafi with centrifuges , manuals and control systems to construct a nuclear weapon .
according to the mannheim district attorney 's office , lerch received 55 million marks -lrb- 28 million euros or $ 34 million -rrb- for his services for a total profit of some 25 million marks .

lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system .

that in turn led to the unraveling of khan 's elaborately-built global arms-dealer bazaar and to the emergence of details of how it peddled nuclear technology to regimes in iran , north korea and libya . khan , also known as the " father of the pakistani nuclear bomb , " had to publicly apologize to the pakistani people in early 2004 and has been placed under house arrest . ever since , probes and arrests in several countries in asia , south africa and europe have brought authorities closer to understanding what mohammed elbaradei , head of the un nuclear watchdog iaea , has called " a veritable wal-mart of black-market proliferation . " unwelcome spotlight on murky dealings though germany remains the first place in which proceedings have been formally opened to call the khan nuclear network to account , there 's no denying that the trial once again shines an unwelcome spotlight on the country 's role at the center of an illegal nuclear smuggling case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's hatf iii missile lifted off successfully in 2002 along with middlemen and firms in several european countries , german companies and individuals have fed equipment , materials and knowledge to nuclear programs in pakistan , north korea and other aspiring nuclear nations since the 1980s . gotthard lerch , who goes on trial on friday , was investigated extensively by german authorities in the 1980s for the misappropriation of blueprints at a joint british , german and dutch uranium enrichment facility in the netherlands .
that was apparently also when he came into contact with abdul qadeer khan .
lerch , however , was never convicted . erich schmidt-eenboom , a writer and expert on intelligence agencies said there were two primary reasons for germany to be involved .
" firstly , germany is a country of hi-tech and cutting-edge technology of the kind that 's required for uranium enrichment and the like and , secondly , it 's an export-oriented country , " schmidt-eenboom said .
" add that up and it 's not surprising to find firms involved in illegal nuclear exports , " he said , adding : " there are always going to be black sheep who are only interested in making hefty profits . " paucity of funds the problem at the same time some believe that the current problem of illegal weapons exports in germany is n't a question of weak export control laws but rather one of resources . mark hibbs , europe and asia editor of nucleonics week journal said one tactic used by european firms wanting to illegally export nuclear technology in the past was to use the widely differing eu jurisdictions to disguise the origin of equipment . " but in the late 1980s , the german government took a leading role in making major advances in export control laws and coordinating and harmonizing its rules with eu laws , " hibbs said .
" today the problem is that export control authorities do n't have sufficient resources - and that includes logistics , money , personnell - to detect smuggling operations .
that 's taken advantage of by countries wanting to import technology for their nuclear programs , who try to outwit the system . " new details on iran ? despite the uncomfortable attention that the case draws to germany , experts agree that the significance of friday 's trial can hardly be overstated . " the trial is hugely important in strengthening international attention on the problem of illegal proliferation , " said götz neuneck of the peace research and security policy at the university of hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan uranium conversion facility he added that the timing of the trial took on added significance in light of the international community 's ongoing conflict with iran over its nuclear program .
" there are lots of unanswered questions in iaea reports on iran , " said neuneck , adding that it was well known that the khan network had supplied teheran with bits of nuclear technology in the 1980s , including high-tech centrifuges . " it would be very good for international non-proliferation if the trial were to provide more details and shine more light on dark corners .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign . " the special rapporteur urges the government of belarus to release immediately and unconditionally all political opponents , to bring all violations of freedom of expression and of the right of peaceful assembly to an immediate end and to ensure that the elections are held in full compliance with international standards , " the statement said . protestors face anti-terror measures if they protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb will enforce order with a heavy hand this weekend also thursday , the head of the belarusian state security , the kgb , warned that opposition supporters planning to take to the streets during the election to protest against lukashenko could face the death sentence . demonstrators who " try to destabilize the situation will be charged with terrorism " and face " sentences of up to 25 years , or life in prison , or capital punishment " , stepan sukhorenko told a news conference in minsk . milinkevich ridiculed claims by sukhorenko that the opposition planned to stage a violent coup under cover of the elections , and charged that " the state is planning total falsification " of the vote . in office since 1994 , lukashenko has vowed defiance in the face of western pressure to reform his soviet-style rule - pressure that has increased with the enlargement of the european union and nato to the borders of belarus . us president george w. bush has called belarus the " last remaining dictatorship in europe " and washington and brussels have openly backed the opposition in the election , for which advance voting began on tuesday . lithuanian lawmakers said thursday six of their delegation have been refused visas to enter belarus to observe the election . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed thursday to the belarus government to respect the rights of the opposition , saying this was " one of the elementary conditions for free and fair elections .

" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .
we are checking various pieces of information .
we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .
there are still no suspects . " one source accusations rebuffed by club and country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger is set to feature at the world cup schweinsteiger , 21 , is one of germany 's brightest prospects and a certainty to make jurgen klinsmann 's final squad for this summer 's world cup finals . the tz was the only media outlet to name him in connection with the investigation , although the rolling news channels gave high prominence to the report . the tz also named two players from the second division 1860 munich club , australian international paul agostino and dutchman quido lanzaat , in connection with the scandal . tz said all three players had been questioned by investigators . bayern munich general manager uli hoeness was enraged , saying schweinsteiger had told the club " he had never bet a euro on a match in his life " .
hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .
" i have nothing to do with it and my club have said the same thing .
i have never bet on a match involving my team before and will never do so in the future , " the dutchman said . it was unclear whether that betting referred to second and third division matches which are currently the subject of a criminal investigation being handled by prosecutors in the western city of frankfurt . with the world cup finals beginning on june 9 , host nation germany could face another match-fixing scandal just as it is shaking off an affair involving a referee who admitted fixing matches . in january 2005 , referee robert hoyzer , 26 , blew the lid on a match-fixing scandal when he admitted to fixing four matches for financial gain . the tainted official had been taking bribes from a croatian mafia circle based in berlin and he named and shamed others involved in the match-rigging ring . last november , hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in jail and another former referee , dominik marks , was given an 18-month suspended sentence .
hoyzer is currently appealing his sentence . berlin-based croat ante sapina was found guilty of masterminding the match-fixing operation and sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de allegations surface of star player involvement in new scandal a german sports magazine has claimed that bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in the illegal mafia betting scandal that is threatening germany 's world cup .

" the eu also needs to stand with the belarusian pro-democracy activists through such acts as imposing strict economic and political sanctions on the belarusian government . " former president of the czech republic vaclav havel and lech walesa , the former polish president - both veterans of the fight to overturn communist rule in the 1980s - said in a joint letter that backing belarusian liberals could hasten the end of lukashenko 's administration . " just like in our countries in those times , the reality in belarus might seem unchangeable and chances for a political transformation slim , " they wrote in a letter published in polish and czech dailies .
" if the eu is able to truly support civic society , the last undemocratic regime at its borders will collapse .
this may happen as quickly as communist regimes once collapsed .
the stronger the opposition is , the less painful the transition to democracy and social transformation will be . " a wave of arrests generates concern the pleas followed concern from the international community on thursday following a wave of arrests of opposition candidates in belarus ahead of this weekend 's presidential election , with the european union brandishing sanctions as minsk authorities warned tougher measures could come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko - europe 's last dictator in brussels the eu 's executive commission and heads of the european parliament 's political groups called on authorities in the ex-soviet republic , led since 1994 by authoritarian president alexander lukashenko , to immediately release those detained in the run-up to sunday 's polls . " the new wave of arrests of opposition leaders in belarus over the last two days is completely unacceptable , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . belarus " should recall that the eu has made clear it stands ready to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals , if the elections are not conducted in a democratic manner , " she said . terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , a europe-wide human rights watchdog , said : " the belarus presidential elections will take place in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation . " " there is no genuine freedom of expression and no freedom of association , " he said in a statement .
" political opponents of the president have been repeatedly and violently harassed .
whatever the outcome , these elections can not be qualified as democratic in any meaning of the word . " council of europe chief says there is much concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis : " little suspense , much concern " referring to sunday 's vote and expectations that lukashenko will be declared the winner , davis said : " there seems to be little suspense , but there is much concern . " " belarus is the only european country which is not a member of the council of europe , and i can only hope that whoever wins the election will use the mandate to bring belarus closer to the european family of free and democratic nations .
this is perhaps excessively optimistic , but optimism - just as people ’ s aspiration to freedom - is far too resilient to be lastingly suppressed . " the concerns came after scandinavian activists were expelled from the country and top opposition politician anatoly lebedko , a key aide to main opposition leader alexander milinkevich , was arrested on wednesday , the latest among dozens of campaigners and journalists to be held in recent days . the arrests appear aimed at stifling an opposition that has gained confidence since uprisings in other ex-soviet nations , notably the so-called " orange revolution " in belarus ' southern neighbor ukraine , in 2004 . un human rights official adds weight to calls for action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has grave concerns about belarus the united nations ' special rapporteur for human rights in belarus , adrian severin , added his organization 's voice to the condemnation . he called " on the government of belarus to immediately cease all actions aimed at intimidating opponents , journalists and human rights defenders and jeopardizing the free and fair running of the electoral campaign .

" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .
we are checking various pieces of information .
we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .
there are still no suspects . " one source accusations rebuffed by club and country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger is set to feature at the world cup schweinsteiger , 21 , is one of germany 's brightest prospects and a certainty to make jurgen klinsmann 's final squad for this summer 's world cup finals . the tz was the only media outlet to name him in connection with the investigation , although the rolling news channels gave high prominence to the report . the tz also named two players from the second division 1860 munich club , australian international paul agostino and dutchman quido lanzaat , in connection with the scandal . tz said all three players had been questioned by investigators . bayern munich general manager uli hoeness was enraged , saying schweinsteiger had told the club " he had never bet a euro on a match in his life " .
hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .
" i have nothing to do with it and my club have said the same thing .
i have never bet on a match involving my team before and will never do so in the future , " the dutchman said . it was unclear whether that betting referred to second and third division matches which are currently the subject of a criminal investigation being handled by prosecutors in the western city of frankfurt . with the world cup finals beginning on june 9 , host nation germany could face another match-fixing scandal just as it is shaking off an affair involving a referee who admitted fixing matches . in january 2005 , referee robert hoyzer , 26 , blew the lid on a match-fixing scandal when he admitted to fixing four matches for financial gain . the tainted official had been taking bribes from a croatian mafia circle based in berlin and he named and shamed others involved in the match-rigging ring . last november , hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in jail and another former referee , dominik marks , was given an 18-month suspended sentence .
hoyzer is currently appealing his sentence . berlin-based croat ante sapina was found guilty of masterminding the match-fixing operation and sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de allegations surface of star player involvement in new scandal a german sports magazine has claimed that bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in the illegal mafia betting scandal that is threatening germany 's world cup .

matthias adrian was a member of the far-right npd party 's youth organization from 1997 to 2000 and organized neo-nazi marches in hesse .
today , he is involved in the berlin-based exit initiative , which helps people leave the right-wing scene . dw-world : how would you say the appearance of far-right youth is changing ?
it appears that many are slowly distancing themselves from the old image of shaved heads and combat boots in order to find new supporters . matthias adrian : it 's very clear to us that the image is changing from that of the skinhead subculture to that of " completely normal " everyday life .
in the 90s , when the word " skinhead " became a pseudonym for right-wing extremist , the far-right was pursuing a strategy of setting up " nationally liberated zones " in the eastern federal states , which were considered far-right strongholds .
these had to be controlled through violence and by suppressing other youth subcultures .
for that , they needed strong young men in bomber jackets . but today across large swaths of the eastern states , for example in mecklenburg-western pomerania , especially in the countryside , these " opponents " simply are n't there anymore .
so the bomber jackets have become unnecessary .
now they 're cultivating another image , that of the " nice nazi next door , " who might be a right-winger , but who also helps old people cross the street . and this is supposed to help them find new supporters ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias adrian in eastern germany , it 's hardly necessary anymore to seek out supporters .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania , it 's become completely acceptable to have a far-right orientation , or at least to see right-wing extremism as a very normal political standpoint .
there has been a real change in this respect .
being a right-wing extremist is no longer a reason to be ostracized by society .
it 's seen as a completely normal political opinion , just like any other . is right-wing extremism still concentrated largely in the eastern states ? unfortunately , these structures are clearly recognizable in the west as well .
of course , not in the magnitude that they are in the east , but in hesse , where i come from , a neo-nazi framework has been firmly established across the region . in most of the wine-growing villages with populations from five to seven thousand , there may only be two or three far-right youths .
but when they get together at a wine festival in the region , then you have about 80 young people in one place who are prepared to use violence .
it can be difficult for other young people , who do n't adhere to the right-wing dress code or are of foreign origin , to get through the mob . so it could be problematic if a lot of far-right youths in the west decided to band together ? the networks are , in any case , definitely there and are expanding .
in the rhine valley region in the last few years we 've seen the development of something remarkable .
the concentration of new right-wing groups here is approaching levels we see in the east .
if these groups spread out , there could be a serious conflagration in the region .
i also find it horrible that this problem is hardly recognized by the public .
sometimes i feel like i 'm a lonely voice in the wilderness . could n't it also be the case that the inhibitions that young people who are not part of the right-wing crowd used to have about attending right-wing concerts have fallen ? yes , of course .
if i as a " normal " young person am afraid to go to that kind of concert , that clearly hurts the image of the far-right movement .
it 's only through this subculture and this music that right-wing groups can reach young people , which is also the reason why these concerts are put on in the first place .
if young people no longer have to be afraid to go to the concert , you can reach more of them than you could through violent behavior . can the development of this far-right image transformation be explained on the basis of the developments in the far-right music scene ? yes , for example , look at the so-called " schoolyard cd . "
the idea came out of the far-right scene , where music groups which support the npd released a cd .
but the songs were so openly nazi and glorified violence so much that they were confiscated .
so the npd released a new cd , which had pretty harmless song titles on it .
only one song , " the skin of one 's teeth , " was categorized as dangerous to youth .
then the npd put out a second cd , which was legally watertight , since it only had songs on it which had already been released and were not on any government watch list . despite that , many teachers took the cds away from students .
one student even pressed charges against a teacher , and he was actually convicted of theft .
because the student was a member of the youth wing of the npd , he had all the power of the party supporting him , including several lawyers who are npd members .
the trial did n't cost him a cent . so the right-wing parties are interacting with the larger society in different ways today than they did several years ago ? the right-wing scene has decided to pursue a legal path these days .
just recently in berlin there was a test case conducted regarding demonstration rights for the npd .
the judge rejected the motion on grounds of a lack of police presence , but still the npd advocated being able to safeguard its legal rights to demonstrate and to assemble .
how can you argue against that ? the npd is trying its best to play by the rules .
we can only try to prevent the scope from expanding , for example , regarding the -lrb- annual -rrb- rudolf hess demonstrations and nazi symbols .
one could still do quite a lot in this area , but that would just lead to the far-right keeping even closer to the rules .
in a few years , the scene will be to the point where they always make their projects legally watertight from the very beginning .
then there will be little that the courts can do to fight them . mirja annawald interviewed matthias adrian -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis spreading message and recruiting through music germany 's neo-nazis are increasingly using music to spread their message , particularly among the unemployed youth of the former communist east germany , according to experts on extremism .

the women 's team is ranked number one in the world , but is generally overshadowed by male counterparts . the germans - world and european champions - beat the united states 4-3 wednesday to take the algarve cup for the first time .
the game remained goalless after 120 minutes , with the match ending in a penalty-shot shootout . despite their 16 shots on goal during regulation time , the americans were unable to win the title .
" it was a good game by both teams , " said us head coach greg rayn .
" it think we played much better this year .
last year , i thought germany dominated the game and we were fortunate to score the goal and defend well .
i think in this match we were the aggressive team , attacking throughout the game . " the game was a rematch of last year 's final , which the world 's number-two-ranked american team won 1-0 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britta carlson scores in germany 's successful european championship campaign as number one , the german women 's team , however , should get more of the limelight in the national public eye . german women soccer players have achieved what the men can only dream of : they 've won the european championships five times ; they won two olympic bronze medals in sydney and athens and in 2003 ; they won the world championship .
it makes the german team one of the most successful women 's national football teams in the world . but judging from the amount of money coming from sponsors , women players have an image problem .
and they have to put up with stereotypes : men ask women in soccer whether their fields are smaller or the matches are shorter or if the girls play with balls made from soft foam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls training with the german women 's team there was a time when men did n't like women to play football at all .
until 1970 , the german football federation banned women from playing professionally .
and although there is more acceptance of women players now , male dominance can still be seen in the structure of the federation : the decision-makers are mostly men .
there are women representatives , but usually only one per federation , if at all . some things have changed , however .

" the conduct from sections of the media is completely irresponsible , " theo zwanziger , president of the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , told german news agency dpa . " there are no facts and so long as that remains the case we have to protect our players and our sport .
it is primitive conduct and damages the reputation of players , bundesliga clubs and the german national team . " on wednesday , plusminus , an online sports magazine for the respected german television channel ard , claimed several bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in illegal betting . the munich prosecutor 's office said it had not released any names to the media . " the prosecutor 's office has not named anyone .
we are checking various pieces of information .
we do not talk about names , " chief prosecutor anton winkler said . " there are still not any accused in this .
there are still no suspects .

hoeness said the club had briefed a lawyer and the newspaper faced " a claim for damages of millions of euros " . denials all round as paranoia sweeps german soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's uli hoeness is threatening legal action lanzaat meanwhile denied the accusations against him .
" i have nothing to do with it and my club have said the same thing .
i have never bet on a match involving my team before and will never do so in the future , " the dutchman said . it was unclear whether that betting referred to second and third division matches which are currently the subject of a criminal investigation being handled by prosecutors in the western city of frankfurt . with the world cup finals beginning on june 9 , host nation germany could face another match-fixing scandal just as it is shaking off an affair involving a referee who admitted fixing matches . in january 2005 , referee robert hoyzer , 26 , blew the lid on a match-fixing scandal when he admitted to fixing four matches for financial gain . the tainted official had been taking bribes from a croatian mafia circle based in berlin and he named and shamed others involved in the match-rigging ring . last november , hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in jail and another former referee , dominik marks , was given an 18-month suspended sentence .
hoyzer is currently appealing his sentence . berlin-based croat ante sapina was found guilty of masterminding the match-fixing operation and sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : allegations surface of star player involvement in new scandal a german sports magazine has claimed that bundesliga players , including a full german international , were involved in the illegal mafia betting scandal that is threatening germany 's world cup .

this follows the announcement that a hospital trust in staffordshire plans to cut one job in seven as managers try to reduce debts of £ 17m .
it is thought three quarters of the redundancies at the university hospital of north staffordshire in stoke-on-trent could be compulsory .
the trust is to cut its 7,000-strong staff by the equivalent of 1,000 posts .
an estimated 370 of the posts will be nurses and midwives .
dr beverly malone , of the royal college of nursing , told bbc news : " we 've seen a steady creep of these types of issues , from the freezing of posts to now we are actually talking about redundancies .
" this could happen at any of the hospitals and trusts that are having deficits and , as we know , there 's a number of them that are in deficit . "
the department of health said it was reassured services would not be cut in the staffordshire hospital .
the job cuts there are in addition to strict controls on recruitment to vacant posts and invitations for expressions of interest from staff over voluntary redundancies , early retirement and reduced working hours .
the chief executive of the university hospital of north staffordshire , anthony sumara , said : " we hope once this most difficult part of the changes is completed the vast majority of staff who remain can begin to feel more secure and confident in the future . "
the total shortfall for the nhs in england this year is expected to be more than double last year 's at £ 620m .
this has been caused partly by more expensive drugs but mostly by a big increase in staff pay , the cost of which the government admits it underestimated .

the trust is to cut its 7,000-strong staff by the equivalent of 1,000 posts .
an estimated 370 of the posts will be nurses and midwives .
dr beverly malone , of the royal college of nursing , told bbc news : " we 've seen a steady creep of these types of issues , from the freezing of posts to now we are actually talking about redundancies .
" this could happen at any of the hospitals and trusts that are having deficits and , as we know , there 's a number of them that are in deficit . "
the department of health said it was reassured services would not be cut in the staffordshire hospital .
the job cuts there are in addition to strict controls on recruitment to vacant posts and invitations for expressions of interest from staff over voluntary redundancies , early retirement and reduced working hours .
the chief executive of the university hospital of north staffordshire , anthony sumara , said : " we hope once this most difficult part of the changes is completed the vast majority of staff who remain can begin to feel more secure and confident in the future . "
the total shortfall for the nhs in england this year is expected to be more than double last year 's at £ 620m .
this has been caused partly by more expensive drugs but mostly by a big increase in staff pay , the cost of which the government admits it underestimated .

gm said it had revised upwards its 2005 loss to $ 10.6bn due to higher costs relating to the restructuring of its business and staff pension liabilities .
the move is a fresh blow to the firm which has suffered heavy losses and falling sales , particularly in the us .
gm is cutting 30,000 jobs over the next three years as it tries to make its business more competitive .
delphi costs in a statement after the stock market closed , gm said it would also delay filing its annual report by two weeks after discovering accounting errors at a subsidiary business .
the additional losses partly stem from gm 's huge restructuring program , which will result in the closure of several factories .
costs relating to plant closures and employee redundancies have risen by $ 300m to $ 1.7bn.
gm 's financial exposure to the car parts supplier delphi , which sought bankruptcy protection last year , have also risen significantly .
as delphi 's former owner and still a significant shareholder , gm is liable to pay the pension and healthcare costs of its workers .
gm revised upwards delphi-related costs from $ 3.6bn to $ 5.5bn and warned its liabilities could potentially be as large as $ 12bn .
gm has been struggling to reverse a trend of poor sales and falling market share in its home market .
' not a disaster ' some analysts have been encouraged that management , led by chief executive rick wagoner , were prepared to make hard decisions about gm 's future operations .
however , a recent report by credit rating firm standard and poor 's said that " time was short " for gm to stave off bankruptcy .
" it is not the end of the world , " david healy , an analyst at burnham securities , said about the latest development .
" the accounting charges seem to be mostly timing , instead of earning in one period they have to state them in another period . "

it is now delivering a better deal for the public , industry and enforcement authorities .
" licensees do n't face a recurring cycle of multiple applications , the police and local authorities have tougher powers to deal with drunken troublemakers and rogue traders , and responsible adults are finally being treated like grown-ups . "
shadow culture secretary hugo swire said the government 's handling of the changes had been " a shambles " .
he said : " ultimately , council taxpayers will be left paying for the government 's mistakes .
" most worrying is the admission that some licence applications were granted without being examined , even though the government promised that residents would have a greater say in opposing rowdy pubs . "

some youngsters had come in from the surrounding suburbs looking for trouble , and they found it on the streets of the left bank .
by the sorbonne , in the intellectual heartland of france , a bookshop was set alight , with rioters smashing up a cafe and using the chairs as missiles against police .
anything that came to hand , from street signs to rocks , was hurled at police officers , as police and youths , some of them masked , fought running battles in this latest stand-off .
water cannon and tear gas dispersed some , for a little while .
but soon they were back .
other youngsters taunted the police , who tried to stand firm behind their riot shields .
elsewhere , police patience was at an end , as they dragged some protesters off by their feet .
one policeman could be seen beating a fallen protester with his riot baton .
government under pressure by mid-evening , the area around the sorbonne - france 's elite university - had become a no-go area for anyone not involved in the fighting .
but eventually , as midnight neared , the area calmed and cleared . "
the government of dominique de villepin is trying to take away our stability and our future - we want to keep secure jobs and be employed " antoine economics student yet this had all started peacefully earlier in the day , when some 120,000 students in paris gathered for a march , and up to 250,000 across france as a whole .
their anger was focused on a new job contract being brought in by the government to tackle chronic unemployment .
one in four young people here is without work .
the new contract will make it easier not just to hire but also to fire those under 26 , which these youngsters see as a threat to their future and any hope of the kind of jobs for life many of their parents and grandparents enjoyed .
antoine , a 23-year old economics student , was marching arm in arm with his friends , holding aloft banners expressing their anger .
for him , the purpose of the march was clear .
" the government of dominique de villepin is trying to take away our stability and our future , " he said .
" we want to keep secure jobs and be employed . "
these demonstrations are growing every day , putting more and more pressure on the french government , which may soon be forced to listen to the growing anger on the streets of france despite dominique de villepin 's stated intention of holding firm .
trade unions are planning even bigger demonstrations across france on saturday , when they hope a million people will join in .
in the marais district , students studying english had made banners in both languages , so their message could be understood both at home and abroad .
" mr de villepin , you are not king " , read one .
" my kingdom for a job contract , " said another .
battle for future this is the future french elite , top students who should be full of hope for the future .
yet today , these youngsters admit to feeling a real sense of gloom about their prospects in france , where unemployment has stayed stubbornly high for years .
jacques heilmann is studying english , but worries about finding a job when he graduates .
" unemployment in france is huge , and we feel let down , and we feel there is nothing to hold on to , " he said .
" we simply do n't know where we are going . "
on thursday night , france watched on as the peaceful marches turned into running battles on the streets of central paris in scenes more reminiscent of november 's riots than images of may 1968 conjured up for some by the sight of students trying to take the sorbonne .
and for many there was once again a sense of a nation at war with itself over how best to face the future .
the economy is the main battleground : pitching those who want change , against many of the young who feel betrayed , and long for the old certainties of jobs for life and guaranteed pensions - and a generous welfare system .
in other words , all the benefits enjoyed by the generation which took to the barricades themselves in france in may 1968 , yet who can no longer promise the same for their children and grandchildren .

the three-bedroom refuge officially opens on friday , although its exact location is being kept a secret .
set up by montgomeryshire family crisis centre -lrb- mfcc -rrb- , an increase in inquiries from men sparked plans for the home .
one male victim , helped by newtown 's mfcc , has told how he suffered emotional and physical abuse at the hands of a former partner .
james , 44 , has two daughters with his ex-partner of 15 years , sarah -lrb- not their real names -rrb- .
james , originally from an english city , but now living in powys , said his partner was a fun-loving person when they first met .
i do n't think men realise either that there are people who can help them james however , their relationship descended into a life of drink , violence and verbal and emotional abuse .
by the time james plucked up the courage to end the relationship last july , she was drinking up to eight cans of strong lager and two bottles of wine a day .
" we used to go out for drinks and we were just fun-loving young people .
there was no indication then what she would eventually turn in to , " he said .
" as her drinking increased her personality changed .
there were many times when my children and i were upstairs trying to sleep and sarah was downstairs drinking and playing loud music until the early hours .
" the next morning i 'd wake and get the girls ready for school and go downstairs to find her lying in her own vomit or urine or both . "
physical attack james described how sarah 's verbal abuse sometimes led to physical attacks .
he said she once threw a cup of tea over his chest .
on another occasion , she focused her attack on his groin , which led to him requiring medical treatment .
" the psychological abuse just chipped away at me , " he explained .
" she would say hurtful things like i was worthless , useless and lazy .
" my family were very supportive and told me to leave sarah , but i could n't - what would have happened to my girls if i had ?
" but men are often too embarrassed to report they are being battered by their partners - it 's a macho thing .
" i do n't think men realise either that there are people who can help them .
they tend to think the help is just for women . "
he said the years of abuse had a " terrible effect " on him .
" it destroyed my confidence and made me a deeply unhappy person , " he said .
eventually , last summer sarah was persuaded to leave their home by the police and it was around that time that he finally sought help from mfcc .
" it was so good to speak to someone who listened .
the people at the centre were incredibly helpful and they just took me seriously .
families are great , but they can often be bias - it 's great to have impartial advice , " said james , who is now happily involved with a new partner .
" had the centre 's safe house been open when i had my problems , then i would have taken advantage of it and taken my girls there . "
the welsh assembly government said it had no figures on male victims of domestic violence .
a spokesman added that specific cases relating to men were not recorded .
james rowlands , from the dyn project in cardiff , which also helps male victims of abuse in wales , said the number of men reporting abuse was on the increase .
but he said that " very little research " had been carried out .
jackie richardson of mfcc , which also has a safe house for women , said it was harder for men to ask for help .
" the old acceptance in society that men should n't cry has to change .
that 's ridiculous and means that men do n't have feelings , " she said .

the 15-day annual order means they can cross the road in llandrindod wells , powys in the mating season , without the fear of being squashed by motorists .
last year , about 2,500 toads , 400 newts and a few frogs made it across the stretch under the cover of darkness .
the toad watch scheme in powys is one of 70 across wales designed to halt the decline of the amphibian 's population .
powys council 's temporary road closure on the 620m section comes into force on friday between 2000 and 0600 gmt .
it is the second year the local authority has shut the road to vehicles .
in previous years , traffic on the road has meant many dating toads have not reached the other side in one piece .
radnorshire wildlife trust has estimated that the area used to have a population of toads around 10,000 strong , but it said their number had dwindled to about 3,000 .
volunteers from the trust are expected to help carry the hundreds of toads across the road in buckets .

they have been selected from a total of 4,033 entrants in a contest being held by us mobile operator verizon wireless and online community service myspace.com.
it is now up to the myspace community , which totals 37.7 million unique visitors worldwide according to audience measurement company comscore networks , to vote for their favourites .
the five bands to receive the most votes will be announced on the calling all bands page on myspace.com on 24 march .
but the final choice will be up to verizon and myspace.com , with the ultimate winner to be announced on 29 march .
the winning band will see their song released as a download on the music service on vcast , the third-generation mobile service from verizon .
it will also be made into a ringtone and a ringback tone .
a music video will be made of the song which people can see either on myspace.com or on vcast phones .
in return the winner will be required to update the contest page on a regular basis with blog entries , photos and videos but will get verizon services and devices worth $ 3,500 for a year as part of their prize .
amazing exposure some of the semi-finalists already tour , have put out cds or music videos .
all are already established on myspace.com.
one of them , an all-girl punk band called aroarah , has toured on the well-known punk warped tour and has been featured in tv adverts for us mobile operator sprint nextel and clothing company converse .
verizon will make the song available as a download they are in the middle of looking for a record label , according to lydia gavin , lead vocalist and guitarist in the band .
winning the competition would bring aroarah " an amazing amount of exposure " , says gavin .
but gavin recognises that putting out a single on vcast will not replace a traditional record deal , not least because " you can contact so many more people than have just the one phone plan " .
verizon started its vcast music download service at the beginning of the year .
it sells music downloads for a pc for 99 cents , and $ 1.99 for downloads via the phone .
it is not clear how many people use the new service .
one industry analyst , lewis ward of international data corporation , estimates that there are just 500,000 vcast customers out of a total of 51.3 million verizon users in total .
reaching fans there is considerable interest from independent musicians and music outlets in putting music out on mobile phones .
people can already share their music from phone to phone , as an mp3 file using the short-range wireless bluetooth technology .
however there is nothing that allows the same kind of worldwide sharing of music from phone-to-phone across different operator networks in the same way that the fixed internet allows .
in contrast myspace has become invaluable to musicians both well established and undiscovered as a way to interact with their fans and make their music available for listening .
aroarah uses its myspace page to keep in touch with fans as far from the band 's native california as germany and the philippines .
" myspace is an amazing tool , " says gavin who , along with her three other band members , has a personal page on the site in addition to the aroarah page .
over the past month , the website , now a part of rupert murdoch 's news corporation , has been taking steps to make its services available via mobile operators in the us , and it is rumoured to be considering a mobile phone service of its own .
