italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators clashed with police outside the venue where berlusconi held an election rally on march 21 so far , berlusconi has been able to count on support from abroad .
however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .
at least , that 's the explanation he gave after prosecutors filed new charges against him . oliver samson -lrb- wl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .

now , german rail wants to block the exhibition from reaching stations in germany . transport number 8 : adolf schonek , born in berlin , was just 14 years old when he was deported from his home in french exile on july 20 , 1942 .
adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .
" people came into the railway station just to take the train , but then they saw that 60 years ago these children took the train from this station as well - in cattle cars that brought them straight to the gas chambers . " of the 11,000 children deported from france , roughly 650 were born in germany or austria - children like adolf schonek and ruth mentzel .

they want to display 150 photographs of the deported german and austrian children in german train stations .
but deutsche bahn has refused their request , citing security issues and a lack of funds .
" we are very aware of the darker side of our company ’ s history , " said deutsche bahn spokesman oliver schumacher in a press release .
" but we think that this sensitive topic should be dealt with within the context of a museum . "
deutsche bahn has offered to display the photographs in the company ’ s museum in nuremberg . but beate klarsfeld has dismissed the offer .
" the exhibition in nuremberg would only reach a special public , only people who want to learn about trains , " she said .
" it would not reach a large public , especially not young people .
we want to make the connection between the place where the photos are seen and the transportation of the children through these train stations on their way to auschwitz . " a responsibility to the victims klarsfeld has been fighting for decades to raise awareness for the crimes of the holocaust in germany and in france .
and she will not take no for an answer .
she and the non-profit group " 11,000 children " demonstrated at german train stations , handing out thousands of postcards to train travelers - addressed to deutsche bahn head hartmut mehdorn .
the central council of jews in germany has said that with their refusal , deutsche bahn is neglecting its responsibility to the victims . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has also made a plea to deutsche bahn to review its decision .

now , german rail wants to block the exhibition from reaching stations in germany . transport number 8 : adolf schonek , born in berlin , was just 14 years old when he was deported from his home in french exile on july 20 , 1942 .
adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .
" people came into the railway station just to take the train , but then they saw that 60 years ago these children took the train from this station as well - in cattle cars that brought them straight to the gas chambers . " of the 11,000 children deported from france , roughly 650 were born in germany or austria - children like adolf schonek and ruth mentzel .
the " deutsche reichsbahn " was not only the logistical power behind the deportations .
the jewish communities were forced to pay train fare - third class tickets were four reichspfennig per kilometer of track .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .

dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .

being jobless is our future " reads this student 's banner in nice protestors marched through french cities on tuesday as opponents of a government youth jobs reform sought to kill off the measure for good , despite concessions from president jacques chirac . unions and student groups have hit france 's streets for a fifth day of nationwide protests to push for complete repeal of the unpopular first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- .
it was signed into law over the weekend , but immediately suspended by president jacques chirac while a new version is drafted . the law 's opponents have been encouraged by the successful campaign that has brought millions of people onto the streets .
despite the first hints of talks to end the month-long crisis , they said it was not the time now to let up the pressure . they predicted another large turnout would force the center-right government into giving new ground .
nearly 200 marches and rallies are planned across the country , with riot police on standby in paris and elsewhere to head off the violence that has erupted on several occasions . protests hit domestic air travel commentators said the scale of tuesday 's demonstrations could determine the outcome of negotiations likely to open in the coming days between the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and the opposition student-union alliance on a new law to supersede the cpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters in paris could still get to work on time on tuesday although commuters on tuesday faced some inconvenience from transport strikes , disruption was limited .
paris 's metro system was operating almost normally and 70 percent of tgv fast trains were running . dozens of domestic flights were cancelled and there were some delays at orly airport . in the northern port of calais , ferries for england were prevented from leaving the quayside . prime minister accused of trampling on labor rights conceived by prime minister dominique de villepin as a tool against youth unemployment - which runs at 22 percent in france - the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it provoked a massive popular backlash , with opponents accusing villepin of trampling on hard-won labor rights and railroading the measure through parliament without due consultation with unions and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chirac has offered some concessions to the disputed law in a bid to defuse one of the most turbulent episodes in his 11-year presidency , chirac agreed on friday to change the cpe 's two most contentious provisions : reducing the two-year probationary period to one year and requiring employers to provide some written reason for dismissal . in a sign of the shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , interior minister and ump chief nicolas sarkozy , who opened contacts with unions over the weekend . unions willing to talk unions and student groups insisted the cpe 's abandonment is a pre-condition for negotiations over a new law .
but there were growing indications they could be drawn into talks .
in a letter to union leaders , bernard accoyer - head of the ump bloc in the national assembly - said the agenda for talks would be completely open . " there is no limit to our discussion , " accoyer said .
" everything is on the table .
it is time to turn the page . " " sarkozy has told us he is willing to discuss everything with no taboos , " francois chereque of the cfdt union said .
" accoyer has said he is willing to hear our reasons why we want the withdrawal of the cpe .
if this is the approach , then we will go to the talks . " on monday , student leader bruno julliard said he would enter talks as long as there was a guarantee none of the cpe contracts would be signed pending the new legislation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "

the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .

now , german rail wants to block the exhibition from reaching stations in germany . transport number 8 : adolf schonek , born in berlin , was just 14 years old when he was deported from his home in french exile on july 20 , 1942 .
adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .
" people came into the railway station just to take the train , but then they saw that 60 years ago these children took the train from this station as well - in cattle cars that brought them straight to the gas chambers . " of the 11,000 children deported from france , roughly 650 were born in germany or austria - children like adolf schonek and ruth mentzel .
the " deutsche reichsbahn " was not only the logistical power behind the deportations .
the jewish communities were forced to pay train fare - third class tickets were four reichspfennig per kilometer of track .
children 10 years and under were charged half , children under four traveled free .
group rates applied . a german obligation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth mentzel , born in berlin , arrested in toulouse , deported with transport 77 more than 60 years after the deportations , beate klarsfeld and her husband serge klarsfeld , president of the french organization " sons and daughters of the deported jews in france , " feel deutsche bahn should pay tribute to these young holocaust victims .
they want to display 150 photographs of the deported german and austrian children in german train stations .
but deutsche bahn has refused their request , citing security issues and a lack of funds .
" we are very aware of the darker side of our company ’ s history , " said deutsche bahn spokesman oliver schumacher in a press release .
" but we think that this sensitive topic should be dealt with within the context of a museum . "
deutsche bahn has offered to display the photographs in the company ’ s museum in nuremberg . but beate klarsfeld has dismissed the offer .
" the exhibition in nuremberg would only reach a special public , only people who want to learn about trains , " she said .
" it would not reach a large public , especially not young people .
we want to make the connection between the place where the photos are seen and the transportation of the children through these train stations on their way to auschwitz . " a responsibility to the victims klarsfeld has been fighting for decades to raise awareness for the crimes of the holocaust in germany and in france .
and she will not take no for an answer .
she and the non-profit group " 11,000 children " demonstrated at german train stations , handing out thousands of postcards to train travelers - addressed to deutsche bahn head hartmut mehdorn .
the central council of jews in germany has said that with their refusal , deutsche bahn is neglecting its responsibility to the victims . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has also made a plea to deutsche bahn to review its decision .
until then , tiefensee has offered the photographs a different transitory home - in the ministry for transport , building and housing in berlin . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

being jobless is our future " reads this student 's banner in nice protestors marched through french cities on tuesday as opponents of a government youth jobs reform sought to kill off the measure for good , despite concessions from president jacques chirac . unions and student groups have hit france 's streets for a fifth day of nationwide protests to push for complete repeal of the unpopular first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- .
it was signed into law over the weekend , but immediately suspended by president jacques chirac while a new version is drafted . the law 's opponents have been encouraged by the successful campaign that has brought millions of people onto the streets .
despite the first hints of talks to end the month-long crisis , they said it was not the time now to let up the pressure . they predicted another large turnout would force the center-right government into giving new ground .
nearly 200 marches and rallies are planned across the country , with riot police on standby in paris and elsewhere to head off the violence that has erupted on several occasions . protests hit domestic air travel commentators said the scale of tuesday 's demonstrations could determine the outcome of negotiations likely to open in the coming days between the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and the opposition student-union alliance on a new law to supersede the cpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters in paris could still get to work on time on tuesday although commuters on tuesday faced some inconvenience from transport strikes , disruption was limited .
paris 's metro system was operating almost normally and 70 percent of tgv fast trains were running . dozens of domestic flights were cancelled and there were some delays at orly airport . in the northern port of calais , ferries for england were prevented from leaving the quayside . prime minister accused of trampling on labor rights conceived by prime minister dominique de villepin as a tool against youth unemployment - which runs at 22 percent in france - the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it provoked a massive popular backlash , with opponents accusing villepin of trampling on hard-won labor rights and railroading the measure through parliament without due consultation with unions and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chirac has offered some concessions to the disputed law in a bid to defuse one of the most turbulent episodes in his 11-year presidency , chirac agreed on friday to change the cpe 's two most contentious provisions : reducing the two-year probationary period to one year and requiring employers to provide some written reason for dismissal . in a sign of the shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , interior minister and ump chief nicolas sarkozy , who opened contacts with unions over the weekend . unions willing to talk unions and student groups insisted the cpe 's abandonment is a pre-condition for negotiations over a new law .
but there were growing indications they could be drawn into talks .
in a letter to union leaders , bernard accoyer - head of the ump bloc in the national assembly - said the agenda for talks would be completely open . " there is no limit to our discussion , " accoyer said .
" everything is on the table .
it is time to turn the page . " " sarkozy has told us he is willing to discuss everything with no taboos , " francois chereque of the cfdt union said .
" accoyer has said he is willing to hear our reasons why we want the withdrawal of the cpe .
if this is the approach , then we will go to the talks . " on monday , student leader bruno julliard said he would enter talks as long as there was a guarantee none of the cpe contracts would be signed pending the new legislation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions .

gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate .
-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- eu seeks new energy partnership with russia european ministers called tuesday for a " new partnership " with russia to secure eu energy imports , after moscow 's natural gas war with ukraine hit the bloc 's supplies in january .
-lrb- march 15 , 2006 -rrb- feedback is germany on the right track with its plans for the energy sector ?

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .
given the current high prices , you 'd be tempted to think that gas is once again under the lock and key of the apothecary . jörn iken -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german energy industry upbeat for 2006 rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .

prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators clashed with police outside the venue where berlusconi held an election rally on march 21 so far , berlusconi has been able to count on support from abroad .
however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .
at least , that 's the explanation he gave after prosecutors filed new charges against him . oliver samson -lrb- wl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?

however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .

being jobless is our future " reads this student 's banner in nice protestors marched through french cities on tuesday as opponents of a government youth jobs reform sought to kill off the measure for good , despite concessions from president jacques chirac . unions and student groups have hit france 's streets for a fifth day of nationwide protests to push for complete repeal of the unpopular first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- .
it was signed into law over the weekend , but immediately suspended by president jacques chirac while a new version is drafted . the law 's opponents have been encouraged by the successful campaign that has brought millions of people onto the streets .
despite the first hints of talks to end the month-long crisis , they said it was not the time now to let up the pressure . they predicted another large turnout would force the center-right government into giving new ground .
nearly 200 marches and rallies are planned across the country , with riot police on standby in paris and elsewhere to head off the violence that has erupted on several occasions . protests hit domestic air travel commentators said the scale of tuesday 's demonstrations could determine the outcome of negotiations likely to open in the coming days between the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and the opposition student-union alliance on a new law to supersede the cpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters in paris could still get to work on time on tuesday although commuters on tuesday faced some inconvenience from transport strikes , disruption was limited .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions .

the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .

industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .

italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .

the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .

italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .

he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists .

nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators clashed with police outside the venue where berlusconi held an election rally on march 21 so far , berlusconi has been able to count on support from abroad .
however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .

being jobless is our future " reads this student 's banner in nice protestors marched through french cities on tuesday as opponents of a government youth jobs reform sought to kill off the measure for good , despite concessions from president jacques chirac . unions and student groups have hit france 's streets for a fifth day of nationwide protests to push for complete repeal of the unpopular first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- .
it was signed into law over the weekend , but immediately suspended by president jacques chirac while a new version is drafted . the law 's opponents have been encouraged by the successful campaign that has brought millions of people onto the streets .
despite the first hints of talks to end the month-long crisis , they said it was not the time now to let up the pressure . they predicted another large turnout would force the center-right government into giving new ground .
nearly 200 marches and rallies are planned across the country , with riot police on standby in paris and elsewhere to head off the violence that has erupted on several occasions . protests hit domestic air travel commentators said the scale of tuesday 's demonstrations could determine the outcome of negotiations likely to open in the coming days between the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and the opposition student-union alliance on a new law to supersede the cpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters in paris could still get to work on time on tuesday although commuters on tuesday faced some inconvenience from transport strikes , disruption was limited .
paris 's metro system was operating almost normally and 70 percent of tgv fast trains were running . dozens of domestic flights were cancelled and there were some delays at orly airport . in the northern port of calais , ferries for england were prevented from leaving the quayside . prime minister accused of trampling on labor rights conceived by prime minister dominique de villepin as a tool against youth unemployment - which runs at 22 percent in france - the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . it provoked a massive popular backlash , with opponents accusing villepin of trampling on hard-won labor rights and railroading the measure through parliament without due consultation with unions and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president chirac has offered some concessions to the disputed law in a bid to defuse one of the most turbulent episodes in his 11-year presidency , chirac agreed on friday to change the cpe 's two most contentious provisions : reducing the two-year probationary period to one year and requiring employers to provide some written reason for dismissal . in a sign of the shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , interior minister and ump chief nicolas sarkozy , who opened contacts with unions over the weekend . unions willing to talk unions and student groups insisted the cpe 's abandonment is a pre-condition for negotiations over a new law .
but there were growing indications they could be drawn into talks .
in a letter to union leaders , bernard accoyer - head of the ump bloc in the national assembly - said the agenda for talks would be completely open . " there is no limit to our discussion , " accoyer said .
" everything is on the table .
it is time to turn the page . " " sarkozy has told us he is willing to discuss everything with no taboos , " francois chereque of the cfdt union said .
" accoyer has said he is willing to hear our reasons why we want the withdrawal of the cpe .
if this is the approach , then we will go to the talks . " on monday , student leader bruno julliard said he would enter talks as long as there was a guarantee none of the cpe contracts would be signed pending the new legislation . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .

the latest research by german gnome historians indicates that they just may herald from a present-day polish city instead . the news released at the first garden gnome congress in the town of trusetal , thuringia shook the foundations of gnome-ology to the core . in the course of normal research activity , a garden gnome expert happened upon an 1886 edition of the deutsche illustrirte zeitung containing an advertisement from a company in neuwedell , a town that was once in german pomerania but is now part of poland , where it is known as drawno .
the ad showed colorful garden gnomes for sale , said frank ullrich , the manager of trusetal 's garden gnome theme park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the garden gnome has become a german symbol until now , the oldest document pointing to the birthplace of the garden gnome was an 1893 article from the illustrirte welt , which seemed to hint that gnome culture had its roots in thuringia .
the recently discovered ad predates the article , suggesting that gnomes actually originated further eastward .
gnome devotee ullrich , however , plans to proceed with caution . " this new evidence does n't say for certain whether the company from neuwedell was also a manufacturer of garden gnomes , " he said .
" we will continue our research . " most experts agree that the ancestors of the modern day garden gnome emerged at the end of the 19th century at one of the three major european centers for the terracotta industry , which in addition to thuringia , also included the czech town of usti nad labem and present-day drawno , poland . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german giant in the world of gnomes with his jolly face and little paunch , reinhard the potter resembles the garden gnomes he produces by the dozen in the little village of graefernroda in germany where , they say , the phenomenon began .

adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .

" of the 11,000 children deported from france , roughly 650 were born in germany or austria - children like adolf schonek and ruth mentzel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : italy takes to the polls italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?
italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators clashed with police outside the venue where berlusconi held an election rally on march 21 so far , berlusconi has been able to count on support from abroad .
however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .
at least , that 's the explanation he gave after prosecutors filed new charges against him . oliver samson -lrb- wl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "

however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions .

the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

" we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms . " germany and italy have respectively accused spain and france of trying to block foreign takeovers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

" we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .

the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions .

gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .

dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .

in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .

now , german rail wants to block the exhibition from reaching stations in germany . transport number 8 : adolf schonek , born in berlin , was just 14 years old when he was deported from his home in french exile on july 20 , 1942 .
adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .
" people came into the railway station just to take the train , but then they saw that 60 years ago these children took the train from this station as well - in cattle cars that brought them straight to the gas chambers . " of the 11,000 children deported from france , roughly 650 were born in germany or austria - children like adolf schonek and ruth mentzel .
the " deutsche reichsbahn " was not only the logistical power behind the deportations .
the jewish communities were forced to pay train fare - third class tickets were four reichspfennig per kilometer of track .
children 10 years and under were charged half , children under four traveled free .
group rates applied . a german obligation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth mentzel , born in berlin , arrested in toulouse , deported with transport 77 more than 60 years after the deportations , beate klarsfeld and her husband serge klarsfeld , president of the french organization " sons and daughters of the deported jews in france , " feel deutsche bahn should pay tribute to these young holocaust victims .
they want to display 150 photographs of the deported german and austrian children in german train stations .
but deutsche bahn has refused their request , citing security issues and a lack of funds .
" we are very aware of the darker side of our company ’ s history , " said deutsche bahn spokesman oliver schumacher in a press release .
" but we think that this sensitive topic should be dealt with within the context of a museum . "
deutsche bahn has offered to display the photographs in the company ’ s museum in nuremberg . but beate klarsfeld has dismissed the offer .
" the exhibition in nuremberg would only reach a special public , only people who want to learn about trains , " she said .
" it would not reach a large public , especially not young people .
we want to make the connection between the place where the photos are seen and the transportation of the children through these train stations on their way to auschwitz . " a responsibility to the victims klarsfeld has been fighting for decades to raise awareness for the crimes of the holocaust in germany and in france .
and she will not take no for an answer .
she and the non-profit group " 11,000 children " demonstrated at german train stations , handing out thousands of postcards to train travelers - addressed to deutsche bahn head hartmut mehdorn .
the central council of jews in germany has said that with their refusal , deutsche bahn is neglecting its responsibility to the victims . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has also made a plea to deutsche bahn to review its decision .
until then , tiefensee has offered the photographs a different transitory home - in the ministry for transport , building and housing in berlin . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

the latest research by german gnome historians indicates that they just may herald from a present-day polish city instead . the news released at the first garden gnome congress in the town of trusetal , thuringia shook the foundations of gnome-ology to the core . in the course of normal research activity , a garden gnome expert happened upon an 1886 edition of the deutsche illustrirte zeitung containing an advertisement from a company in neuwedell , a town that was once in german pomerania but is now part of poland , where it is known as drawno .
the ad showed colorful garden gnomes for sale , said frank ullrich , the manager of trusetal 's garden gnome theme park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the garden gnome has become a german symbol until now , the oldest document pointing to the birthplace of the garden gnome was an 1893 article from the illustrirte welt , which seemed to hint that gnome culture had its roots in thuringia .
the recently discovered ad predates the article , suggesting that gnomes actually originated further eastward .
gnome devotee ullrich , however , plans to proceed with caution . " this new evidence does n't say for certain whether the company from neuwedell was also a manufacturer of garden gnomes , " he said .
" we will continue our research . " most experts agree that the ancestors of the modern day garden gnome emerged at the end of the 19th century at one of the three major european centers for the terracotta industry , which in addition to thuringia , also included the czech town of usti nad labem and present-day drawno , poland . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german giant in the world of gnomes with his jolly face and little paunch , reinhard the potter resembles the garden gnomes he produces by the dozen in the little village of graefernroda in germany where , they say , the phenomenon began .

being jobless is our future " reads this student 's banner in nice protestors marched through french cities on tuesday as opponents of a government youth jobs reform sought to kill off the measure for good , despite concessions from president jacques chirac . unions and student groups have hit france 's streets for a fifth day of nationwide protests to push for complete repeal of the unpopular first employment contract -lrb- cpe -rrb- .
it was signed into law over the weekend , but immediately suspended by president jacques chirac while a new version is drafted . the law 's opponents have been encouraged by the successful campaign that has brought millions of people onto the streets .
despite the first hints of talks to end the month-long crisis , they said it was not the time now to let up the pressure . they predicted another large turnout would force the center-right government into giving new ground .
nearly 200 marches and rallies are planned across the country , with riot police on standby in paris and elsewhere to head off the violence that has erupted on several occasions . protests hit domestic air travel commentators said the scale of tuesday 's demonstrations could determine the outcome of negotiations likely to open in the coming days between the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- and the opposition student-union alliance on a new law to supersede the cpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters in paris could still get to work on time on tuesday although commuters on tuesday faced some inconvenience from transport strikes , disruption was limited .

but there were growing indications they could be drawn into talks .
in a letter to union leaders , bernard accoyer - head of the ump bloc in the national assembly - said the agenda for talks would be completely open . " there is no limit to our discussion , " accoyer said .
" everything is on the table .
it is time to turn the page . " " sarkozy has told us he is willing to discuss everything with no taboos , " francois chereque of the cfdt union said .
" accoyer has said he is willing to hear our reasons why we want the withdrawal of the cpe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 germany to massively invest in energy sector großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " less reliance on imports , greater efficiency " chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms . " germany and italy have respectively accused spain and france of trying to block foreign takeovers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .

now , german rail wants to block the exhibition from reaching stations in germany . transport number 8 : adolf schonek , born in berlin , was just 14 years old when he was deported from his home in french exile on july 20 , 1942 .
adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .
" people came into the railway station just to take the train , but then they saw that 60 years ago these children took the train from this station as well - in cattle cars that brought them straight to the gas chambers . " of the 11,000 children deported from france , roughly 650 were born in germany or austria - children like adolf schonek and ruth mentzel .
the " deutsche reichsbahn " was not only the logistical power behind the deportations .
the jewish communities were forced to pay train fare - third class tickets were four reichspfennig per kilometer of track .
children 10 years and under were charged half , children under four traveled free .
group rates applied . a german obligation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruth mentzel , born in berlin , arrested in toulouse , deported with transport 77 more than 60 years after the deportations , beate klarsfeld and her husband serge klarsfeld , president of the french organization " sons and daughters of the deported jews in france , " feel deutsche bahn should pay tribute to these young holocaust victims .
they want to display 150 photographs of the deported german and austrian children in german train stations .
but deutsche bahn has refused their request , citing security issues and a lack of funds .
" we are very aware of the darker side of our company ’ s history , " said deutsche bahn spokesman oliver schumacher in a press release .
" but we think that this sensitive topic should be dealt with within the context of a museum . "
deutsche bahn has offered to display the photographs in the company ’ s museum in nuremberg . but beate klarsfeld has dismissed the offer .
" the exhibition in nuremberg would only reach a special public , only people who want to learn about trains , " she said .
" it would not reach a large public , especially not young people .
we want to make the connection between the place where the photos are seen and the transportation of the children through these train stations on their way to auschwitz . " a responsibility to the victims klarsfeld has been fighting for decades to raise awareness for the crimes of the holocaust in germany and in france .
and she will not take no for an answer .

adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .

adolf is just one of the " jewish children deported from france , " an exhibition of photographs displayed in railway stations throughout france for over two years . " it was important , because we had a public we had never had before , " said beate klarsfeld , one of the organizers of the exhibit .
" people came into the railway station just to take the train , but then they saw that 60 years ago these children took the train from this station as well - in cattle cars that brought them straight to the gas chambers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 stuttgart seeks to ban anti-fascist symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " against nazis " reads the patch on this left-wing supporter 's jacket the use of swastikas is banned under german law .
but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators clashed with police outside the venue where berlusconi held an election rally on march 21 so far , berlusconi has been able to count on support from abroad .
however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .
at least , that 's the explanation he gave after prosecutors filed new charges against him . oliver samson -lrb- wl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .

meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 germany to massively invest in energy sector großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " less reliance on imports , greater efficiency " chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .
a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms . " germany and italy have respectively accused spain and france of trying to block foreign takeovers . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .

the latest research by german gnome historians indicates that they just may herald from a present-day polish city instead . the news released at the first garden gnome congress in the town of trusetal , thuringia shook the foundations of gnome-ology to the core . in the course of normal research activity , a garden gnome expert happened upon an 1886 edition of the deutsche illustrirte zeitung containing an advertisement from a company in neuwedell , a town that was once in german pomerania but is now part of poland , where it is known as drawno .
the ad showed colorful garden gnomes for sale , said frank ullrich , the manager of trusetal 's garden gnome theme park . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the garden gnome has become a german symbol until now , the oldest document pointing to the birthplace of the garden gnome was an 1893 article from the illustrirte welt , which seemed to hint that gnome culture had its roots in thuringia .
the recently discovered ad predates the article , suggesting that gnomes actually originated further eastward .
gnome devotee ullrich , however , plans to proceed with caution . " this new evidence does n't say for certain whether the company from neuwedell was also a manufacturer of garden gnomes , " he said .
" we will continue our research . " most experts agree that the ancestors of the modern day garden gnome emerged at the end of the 19th century at one of the three major european centers for the terracotta industry , which in addition to thuringia , also included the czech town of usti nad labem and present-day drawno , poland . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german giant in the world of gnomes with his jolly face and little paunch , reinhard the potter resembles the garden gnomes he produces by the dozen in the little village of graefernroda in germany where , they say , the phenomenon began .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions .

" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .
social democrat gabriel rejects this , but said he appreciates the almost cordial manner with which his opponents were prepared to tackle the problem . nuclear energy as import substitute merkel is seen as cautious on the politically divisive issue .
industry players are pushing for an extension of the deadline and say nuclear energy can not be discarded if the country wants to become less dependent on imports . however , germany 's four largest energy and gas suppliers did say they would work with the government during a nuclear phase-out . monday night 's meeting comes amid a heated debate in the european union on protectionism and forging a common energy policy in which merkel has proven outspoken . at an eu summit in brussels last month , she warned : " the -lrb- eu -rrb- internal market can not work unless electricity can flow freely and if we can agree on european champions and not think strictly in national terms .

a coalition dispute over atomic energy , however , might not go away . german chancellor angela merkel said monday night that the country 's big energy companies had pledged billions of euros of investment in the sector in coming years to help germany reshape its energy policy . " the business world has promised to invest 30 billion euros in infrastructure and new plants by 2012 , " merkel said .
" we can expect investment of 33 to 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 52 billion -rrb- in renewable energy sources , " she added . merkel was speaking at the close of a meeting with industry leaders on formulating a new energy policy , which she hopes will make germany less reliant on foreign suppliers and help contain rising energy prices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- back , center -rrb- opened the national energy summit in berlin on monday leaders at the meeting also stressed the need to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel said on tuesday morning that monday 's talks focused on " how -lrb- germans -rrb- can save energy while maintaining the same standard of living . " gabriel added that while the government could possibly help to keep gas and energy prices capped , it was clear that they could not be dropped . furthermore , gabriel said on german public television tuesday morning that energy suppliers would work together on developing power plants that produce fewer environmentally harmful emissions .
gabriel said a coal-powered plant would be created by 2014 that would generate no co2 emissions . more funding for energy research merkel said the government would - between now and 2009 - set aside two billion euros for funding energy research in a bid to bolster the country 's use of renewable energy .
merkel 's stated aim is to draft a new energy policy by the end of next year that will map out germany 's approach until 2020 . " we agree that our objective should be to limit our dependence on imported energy , to prevent increases in the energy price and to take into account the environmental challenges , " merkel said . she said three working groups would be formed to draft the new energy policy and industry players and the government would hold a follow-up meeting in september . the conservative chancellor 's decision to hold an " energy summit , " as monday 's meeting has been dubbed here , is seen as motivated by rising energy prices and russia 's gas war with ukraine , which affected supplies to europe . economy minister michael glos and environment minister gabriel said earlier that heavy reliance on mineral oil meant that germany and the european union would remain dependent on " politically unstable supply regions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new utility tower being installed oil still germany 's primary energy source mineral oil remains the main source of german energy , supplying 36 percent of the country 's energy needs .
gas serves as the second biggest source at 22.7 percent .
the country imports roughly a third of its gas from russia . merkel said leaders at the meeting also touched on nuclear energy and discussed ways of replacing it .
" we will speak of this again in the coming months , with a measure of controversy i suppose , " she added . germany 's christian democrats and social democrats , the two parties in chancellor merkel 's government , are divided over nuclear energy .
during the last government , the social democrats launched a gradual phase-out under which germany would shut down all its nuclear reactors by 2020 . that deal is still government policy .
but christian democrats would like to see the issue re-visited .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 in germany , gas station attendants at your service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shell wants modern-day gas attendants to woo customers gas stations in germany face stiff competition .
the shell company is upping the stakes by bringing the 1950s-style gas station attendant back to life . back in the good ol ' days , you could pull into a gas station and three spiffy attendants would pop out from behind the cashier 's counter , clean your windows and polish your fenders whilst filling your tank .
if you needed your tire pressure or oil checked , no problem - it was all part of the service . you 'd almost look forward to going for a sunday afternoon fill-up . that all changed in the 1970s .
along with higher prices and longer lines , customers were forced to grab the nozzle and pump their own gas .
in the disco age , the only place you 'd encounter an attendant was behind the cash register . but the times are a-changin ' again .
gas giant shell now says it will hire gas-pump attendants at 720 stations throughout germany .
the service will include filling up the tank as well as checking oil , tire pressure and windshield fluid , said shell spokesperson matthias von glischinski-kurc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-style service a fringe benefit for people on the move shell said it made the decision due to the tough competition on the german market .
germany currently has about 15,000 fueling stations nationwide , but that number has been on the decline for a long time .
according to the german association of gas station owners , about 200 stations close each year .
the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

the reason : turnover from gas sales has been decreasing over the years , while profit margins in germany are some of the lowest in europe . that is why bp / aral , following a slash of 2,500 jobs last year , recently said it would downsize even more .
competitor shell is trying hard to buck the trend and increase its market share by providing the benefits of gas station attendants . " a survey we commissioned not long ago showed that the service is particularly attractive to businesspeople , women and older drivers , " said glischinski-kurc .
" that was also clearly confirmed by a pilot study we did over several months at 25 different stations across germany . " putting on a happy face a shell station in the stellingen district of hamburg is one of the 25 pilot stations .
most customers there have been grateful for the full-service option .
" it 's a new service and i think it 's fine , " one customer said .
" as long as it does n't cost extra , then it 's great , " said another . but not everybody can sit tight and let others do the pumping .
" some customers tell us not to even go near their cars , " said attendant oktay yazici .
" they just start yelling their heads off .
but our motto is always : ' just keep smiling ! " ' whether or not the majority of german customers will actually accept the service is the big question .
aral tried a similar tactic several years ago , but could no longer cover the costs .
now , shell says customers can decide if they want the service or not .
if they do , they can pull into a special full-serve lane , and can also decide whether or not to pay the 1 euro -lrb- $ 1.20 -rrb- surcharge .
shell is also confident it will sell more motor oil and windshield wiper fluid with the new concept . but the association of gas station owners is skeptical about whether customers will dole out their money for full-serve .
germans are notorious penny pinchers - a trend that has increased over the past few years . so it 's unlikely that the full-service offered by shell will change their reluctance to fill ' er up in times of high prices for gasoline and diesel . way back in the golden , olden days , motorists used to buy their fuel in pharmacies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : italy takes to the polls italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?
italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "
a threat of violence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators clashed with police outside the venue where berlusconi held an election rally on march 21 so far , berlusconi has been able to count on support from abroad .
however , in march , the us state department said it was " greatly concerned about italy 's security situation , " referring to violent street clashes between left extremists and police in a rally by fascists in milan that left 18 people injured .
the us government warned that violence in italy could erupt again ahead of the polls .
berlusconi blamed the " leftist intellectuals with their political agenda " of organizing the violent rallies , adding that they were motivated by " hate " against the middle-right .
at least , that 's the explanation he gave after prosecutors filed new charges against him . oliver samson -lrb- wl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy rejects easing assisted fertility a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 04.04.2006 italian election campaigns turn cut-throat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi : no capitulation in front of the left italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support . " italy is the real sick man of europe , " wrote the newsmagazine the economist recently .
zero economic growth , increased corruption and tax avoidance , isolation in europe , a complicated security situation due to the war in iraq - all plague the country .
only berlusconi-owned media provide a more positive picture .
italy 's poor health is just one reason why election campaigns are more vicious there than anywhere else in europe .
" italy is seeing a revival of cut-throat electioneering , " said andreas maurer , an expert on italy at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he explained that campaigns are exceptionally heated given " that the two candidates do n't particularly like each other . "
the same old story with a difference the right against the left , communists against christian democrats - historically , campaigners in italy have always been at each others ' throats .
but 2006 is different .
italy 's political landscape underwent a dramatic change in the 1990 's after major parties collapsed following one corruption scandal after another .
new parties sprouted and italy 's pluralistic political landscape looked like a colorful mosaic .
but now , the situation has stabilized and there are essentially just two camps .
the battle lines are drawn between the governing center-right coalition led by prime minister silvio berlusoni , leader of the house of freedoms , and a center-left coalition led by former prime minister romano prodi , leader of the union . a new law passed by the italian parliament in december 2005 is another reason why parties are campaigning harder than ever .
parties must reach at least four percent of the vote before gaining a seat in parliament .
the threshold is likely to see the demise of many smaller political parties .
rude , loud and ridiculous " anyone that has been following the election campaigns could be mistaken into believing that italy is in the midst of a civil war , " said sergio romana , a respected political commentator and former ambassador .
he said many campaigns are " extremely loud , rude , ridiculous - and not particularly informative . "
the opposition accuses berlusconi of economic mismanagement , corruption and involvement with the mafia .
berlusconi himself is ready to win a vote at any price .
he made headlines in an april 24 election speech , where he accused communists in mao 's china of having " boiled babies into fertilizer , " a dubious attempt to link such repulsive practices to italian communists who are part of prodi 's coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painted red : romano prodi in fact , berlusconi blames the left for just about everything that goes wrong in italy .
judges , prosecutors , the employers ' association - " are all infiltrated by communists , " claimed berlusconi .
" only left-wing newspapers are reporting that the country is in an economic crisis , " he added throwing barbs at his opponents ' negative views . berlusconi has even estimated the influence of communist journalists to be 85 percent .
how he came to that figure is anyone 's guess , given that berlusconi 's media empire controls nearly all of italy 's tv stations . rubbing shoulders with fascists only berlusconi 's own television stations are reporting his lead in election opinion polls .
a quarter of all voters appear to be undecided .
scratching the bottom of the political barrel , berlusconi has created a wide coalition of partners with rather questionable policies .
they include the hard-right " alternativa soziale " led by alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of fascist dictator benito mussolini , and even neo-fascists and holocaust deniers such as roberto fiore .
in an address last month , berlusconi personally spoke out against immigration .
" i do not want italy to become a multi-ethnic , multi-cultural country , " he said .
in 2002 , berlusconi 's government put in place a tough immigration policy , allowing only immigrants with job contracts to obtain a residency permit .
" it is quite possible that berlusconi 's immigration policy will see him pick up votes from the middle-class , " explained andreas maurer .
he said berlusconi could still win the election .
" a scandal from the prodi camp is all he 'll need to retake the lead . "

but they are a common element in symbols used by the left-wing movement .
the stuttgart district attorney now wants legal clarity on this contradiction . a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a little stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany . that 's despite the fact that the swastika itself is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization .
german law allows its use , though , if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism . the stuttgart district attorney 's office feels this regulation requires greater clarity .
it has now filed charges against nix gut , a mail-order company which specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia favored by punks and other supporters of the left-wing movement . the winnenden-based company is accused of distributing merchandise with modified nazi symbols . " the disputed point is when is this type of symbol clearly recognizable as such , " district attorney tomke beddies said . she said that the justice system in baden-württemberg handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
stuttgart now wanted legal clarity , she said . " we want consistency in order to settle this awkward situation , " beddies said . nix gut welcomed the charges , as the case will finally clarify the legality of such merchandise incorporating swastikas , it said . could swastikas become socially acceptable ? but social democrat sebastian edathy , head of the committee on internal affairs in the german parliament , said the district attorney 's actions harmed the battle against right-wing extremism and neo-nazism . " the expression of a democratic attitude , worthy of support , is being criminalized , " said edathy .
" this is a scandal in the administration of justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : punks often use broken swastikas to express their political beliefs beddies , however , maintains that if the law banning swastikas is not clearly implemented , neo-nazis might eventually be able to make use of this and adapt the symbol to express their convictions . " there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said beddies .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case . " " we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal , " beddies said . wolfgang kraushaar , a political scientist at the hamburg institute for social research , said that this process of normalization was widespread historically . " it has been common for protest movements to use certain symbols to express their rejection of that symbol 's association , " said kraushaar , whose research focuses on protest and opposition movements in germany since 1949 . is a crossed-out swastika a universal symbol ? kraushaar said there have been repeated cases in germany in which left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis . last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student has since won his appeal before the regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button . according to beddies , the stuttgart district attorney also feared that a casual observer might misunderstand such symbols , and that this was another reason for the legal action .
but kraushaar said this form of pictogram was a practically universal symbol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this symbol is universally understood as being against nazis " a japanese tourist would understand its meaning just as well as a german , " kraushaar said .
he said it was noticeable that the german justice system followed anti-nazi supporters more closely than right-wing extremists . " a backpack with a button is a bagatelle as opposed to a neo-nazi rally , " kraushaar said . the stuttgart district attorney has filed the charges directly with the regional court .
nix gut is expected to appeal the case if it loses .
the ruling would then go straight to the federal court of justice . the anti-fascist movement has certainly gained some prominent political support in its fight to use the controversial symbol .
in reaction to the case against nix gut , the head of the green party , claudia roth , reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the bomber jackets have become unnecessary " in a conversation with dw-world , matthias adrian discussed how skinheads are changing their image and how increasing numbers of youth , even those without far-right philosophies , are attending right-wing concerts .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .

but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2006 opinion : germany 's energy policy gets a second wind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day the taps will run dry government and business plan to stem the rise in energy prices with billions worth of investments .
but what else needs to be done ?
dw 's henrik böhme says it 's all about getting the balance right . energy is clearly a priority issue right now - especially in a country as reliant on imports as germany is .
against this backdrop , monday saw angela merkel meet with industry leaders for talks on how to reshape germany 's floundering energy policy . a wake-up call in fact , the initial impetus for the energy summit came from moscow .
when president vladimir putin turned off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year in an energy price dispute , the move also hit russian exports to western europe , as most of its gas arrives channeled through ukrainian pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few people wonder where gas comes from the incident was something of a wake-up call to germany , prompting many to wonder - often for the first time - where the country 's energy actually comes from .
the answer was basically bad news .
apart from coal , germany has little going for it on the energy front .
and germany 's coal mines are supported with billions worth of subsidies , making the industry almost unsustainably expensive .
gas and oil , meanwhile , are bought from abroad , as is the uranium for the nation 's nuclear power plants . insatiable global demand but the reasons for the hikes in energy prices do not lie in germany .
unlike in other countries , energy consumption in this country has been steadily sinking in recent years , even though worldwide consumption has doubled since the early 1970s . the insatiable international demand for resources in fast-developing nations such as china and india is one factor boosting prices , while another is globalization .
the bottom line is that energy is a product subject to market forces .
and it 's also a determining factor when it comes to the distribution of wealth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the energy issue is a tangled web but german consumers are increasingly fed up with the skyrocketing prices for electricity , natural gas and gasoline .
largely to blame is the monopoly of the major energy suppliers , who want to be able to plan ahead for the next few decades .
meanwhile , environmentalists are pushing for more climate-friendly energy policies . a workable policy the summit on monday night was faced with the challenge of juggling these conflicting interests and jumpstarting a dialogue designed to lead to a workable energy policy for all . observers had warned that the summit was unlikely to yield spectacular results , which was a fair-enough point - after all , a problem of this complexity will never be solved in just three hours . the key issue here is to ensure that the dialogue remains ideology-free . it needs to be embedded in a pan-european strategy , and that rules out any stubborn refusal of nuclear energy .
and even though germany might be sticking to its guns in its phase-out of nuclear energy , it 's actually undergoing a worldwide renaissance . striking the balance but berlin has identified a way out of its import dependency in the form of renewable resources such as sun , wind and biomass energy .
as world leaders in technology with export figures to be proud of , representatives from these areas were active participants in monday 's talks .
so germany does apparently have more to offer than coal - and that something also reduces the country 's reliance on imports , creates jobs , and saves the planet in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the natural way but before anyone starts building windmills and sun collectors across the country , the coal mines should be given a second chance , while germany 's nuclear powers stations should run for as long as they 're still safe .
it 's all a question of getting the balance right .
in 60 years time , there will be no crude oil left , and another option better have been found by then .
and given that the multinationals who earn their money with oil also need to survive , it seems reasonable enough to assume that the market will also do its bit in sorting out the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leave it in the garage and walk in the meantime , it 's always worth being economical with the precious commodity that is energy , whether that means investing in efficient technology or ensuring better heat insulation .
moreover , if everyone steered clear of gas-guzzling cars and made sure the stand-by buttons on the television , radio and computer are switched off , then two entire powers stations could be closed down overnight . henrik böhme -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany to massively invest in energy sector chancellor angela merkel said political and industry leaders at a monday summit agreed it is vital to reduce germany 's reliance on energy imports .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- war-scarred angola seeks a future bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 4 april 2006 , 05:57 gmt 06:57 uk war-scarred angola seeks a future angola is marking four years since the government and the unita rebels signed a peace agreement , ending 27 years of almost continuous war .
the bbc 's sarah grainger looks at the mood in the country .
francisca segunda came to a united nations feeding centre in huambo because her one-year-old son , domingos , was suffering from malnutrition .
she lives in huambo and sells meat to make money , but sometimes there is no meat to sell and no-one to buy it and she goes without food .
that makes it hard to breast-feed her baby too .
the area around huambo used to be the breadbasket of angola , but now it struggles to feed itself , having been in the firing line throughout angola 's civil war .
the once-thriving agricultural sector here came to a halt during the war and its renaissance has been thwarted by the presence of mines in the surrounding fields and the flight of a large part of its population .
people are glad that peace has come to stay , yet most have not yet experienced a full harvest of their subsistence crops .
packed city huambo , however , is only one half of angola 's story .
its lush green vegetation and quiet streets are in stark contrast to the capital , luanda , which is now home to around 4m people , over half of whom fled there from places like huambo during the fighting .
the city 's roads are clogged with cars and the slums , called musseques , stretch for miles beyond luanda 's former city limits .
people who owned conventional houses built extra homes in their yards to accommodate family members who fled here .
they now rent these tiny houses out to a population desperate for accommodation .
" luanda is the dream for people in angola , " says candida , a 26-year-old who lives in the capital .
she pays $ 150 a month to rent out a room in a block of flats in the centre of town .
it used to be the lift lobby for the other flats , but candida likes to think of it as a studio .
" there 's nothing in the provinces to go back to .
no schools , no jobs , " she tells me .
luanda , by contrast , is the centre of the country 's thriving oil industry : the place where business is done , decisions are made and bribes change hands .

that makes it hard to breast-feed her baby too .
the area around huambo used to be the breadbasket of angola , but now it struggles to feed itself , having been in the firing line throughout angola 's civil war .
the once-thriving agricultural sector here came to a halt during the war and its renaissance has been thwarted by the presence of mines in the surrounding fields and the flight of a large part of its population .
people are glad that peace has come to stay , yet most have not yet experienced a full harvest of their subsistence crops .

people who owned conventional houses built extra homes in their yards to accommodate family members who fled here .
they now rent these tiny houses out to a population desperate for accommodation .
" luanda is the dream for people in angola , " says candida , a 26-year-old who lives in the capital .
she pays $ 150 a month to rent out a room in a block of flats in the centre of town .

' inexplicable poverty ' anti-corruption watchdog transparency international rated angola one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world in 2005 , noting that like many countries with oil resources it faces " inexplicable poverty and deprivation " .
there is some money in luanda but it does not reach most people however , people here are willing to turn a blind eye to corruption , because after 27 years of war , it is preferable to more fighting .
in any case , most angolans seem to be ambivalent about a delay in the electoral process .
memories are long , and the last elections in 1992 sparked some of the worst fighting of the civil war .
moreover , there is little doubt in many people 's minds who will win .
" if i see dos santos ' name on the ballot paper , " one young man in luanda tells me , " then i wo n't vote .
there 's no point .
we know who will win . "
many people see no alternative to president dos santos .
" if we had someone new in power , " says candida , " they would just use the opportunity to take everything they could for themselves .
at least , with dos santos , we know where we stand . "

sue mills , 44 , of southend , essex , said the two injections were her last hope .
she has been told it could take three months before she feels any benefit .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- chernobyl diary - part one bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 4 april 2006 , 06:27 gmt 07:27 uk chernobyl diary - part one a bbc news website team is in ukraine to assess the legacy of the nuclear disaster at chernobyl , 20 years after it spewed radiation across europe .
reporter stephen mulvey and photographer phil coomes will publish their reports and picture galleries closer to the anniversary itself on 26 april .
this diary records their impressions as they gather facts and interview people affected by the tragedy .
they will be in ukraine until 5 april .
click here to see the stories you asked them to cover contamination confusion 2 april : 2300 -lrb- 2000 gmt -rrb- the effects of the chernobyl disaster were felt far beyond the limits of the 30km -lrb- 19 mile -rrb- zone around the plant .
reindeer as far away as the nordic countries and sheep in some british uplands became unfit for human consumption .
the land rendered uninhabitable also stretches out beyond the 30km mark , mainly to the north , in belarus , and to the west , in ukraine .
at the same time there are areas inside the 30km zone -lrb- mainly in the south -rrb- which are less contaminated than parts of kiev .
blame the weather for this .
the wind blew fallout in various directions before it fell to earth or was chucked down in rainstorms .
it took a while to draw up a good contamination map , but people needed to be evacuated quickly .
there was at least one case where people were moved from one of the cleaner villages inside the zone , to a more severely contaminated area outside it .
we met some people today who experienced a different problem , in some ways the reverse .
they lived outside the zone in a village that was only recognised as a radiation hotspot five years after the accident .
they were evacuated very late , to a newly-built village 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
the new homes were thrown up quickly and without sufficient care .
many suffer from subsidence .
sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye that what was once a horizontal line of bricks is now slanting down at one end .
cracked walls abound .
the fine wooden houses the villagers left behind were bulldozed to ensure they were never inhabited again .
only the cemetery there remains intact .
every family returns to it , the week after easter , for a picnic with their ancestors .
heroic efforts 1 april : 2100 -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- we talked today to two people whose lives have been touched by the chernobyl disaster , in completely different ways .
one founded a youth movement , aimed at teaching young people to care for the environment , before she had even entered her teens .
a professor gave a talk about chernobyl at her school , and she decided there and then that something should be done .
now 19 , she has already been doing it for several years .
she and her fellow activists visit schools to spread their message and organise out-of-school activities in their own suburb of kiev .
so , for example , if you ever come across a group of uniformed children cycling through woods on the outskirts of kiev on litter patrol , do n't be surprised .
the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .
he spent three days following instructions to pump water into the ruins , by which time he had soaked up so much radiation he would never be allowed to work in the nuclear industry again .
he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .
we also visited kiev 's chornobyl museum -lrb- " chornobyl " being the ukrainian version of the russian " chernobyl " , which has become standard in english -rrb- .
the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .
a video shows , fleetingly , one of the six weddings that took place in pripyat on 26 april , hours after the explosion .
there is also footage recording the heroic efforts of miners to tunnel under the reactor so that a heat exchanger could be built to halt the progress of the molten reactor core , if it burned its way through the plant 's lower depths .
there are no postcards or souvenirs .
maybe it would be disrespectful if there were .
however , i suspect there would be a market for them .
mysterious gas masks 31 march : 2230 -lrb- 1930 gmt -rrb- the story of the gas masks in the nursery schools turns out to be more complicated than i thought .
the explosion at the power station happened at 0123 on a saturday morning .
life in pripyat continued pretty much as normal for the rest of the day , but the town was evacuated on the sunday .
there were no children left to go back to school on monday .
so ... where did the gas masks come from ?
vladimir usatenko , a former member of parliament who spent much of the 1990s drafting laws governing nuclear power , tells me that the gas masks were held in the school - as they were in all schools - for use in case of attack by the us and its allies .
they were dragged out of cupboards and scattered around the classrooms by people who visited the school long after the evacuation .
possibly even by unscrupulous journalists .
the guides who show visitors around the zone are working flat out as the 20th anniversary approaches .
we bumped into danish , finnish and german radio and tv crews , and saw others from a distance .
one of these other crews was covered from head to toe in protective gear , with only their eyes exposed .
this , surely , was for theatrical effect .
we wore disposable gloves if we touched anything that could have been contaminated , washed before eating and after returning to the hotel , and left our muddy wellington boots behind when we left .
we would have worn masks had the weather been dry and dusty .
we were checked for contaminants on leaving the zone , and found to be clean .
no show horses 1430 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- no przewalski 's horses were posing for photographers today , unfortunately .
a couple of weeks ago they were paying regular visits to a big haystack on the outskirts of town , provided by the chernobyl fire brigade .
but the weather has improved and they can find plenty to eat elsewhere .
the horses , which originated in mongolia , became extinct in the wild in the 1960s , but have been successfully bred on a reserve in southern ukraine .
the chernobyl zone provided another area big enough for them to occupy comfortably , so they were introduced here too .
three years ago , according to wormwood forest , a natural history of the zone by american-ukrainian author mary mycio , there were 65 of them .
visiting pripyat is an unforgettable experience .
the nursery school was the most moving place we called at .
tiny shoes , dolls , a class photo album .
i came across a teaching plan for one class for the year 1985-86 .
it was filled in right up to 25 april , the day before the disaster .
the teachers had developed the children 's speaking ability by discussing a poem , the little flag , and gone on to practise counting , while at the same time consolidating their knowledge of colours , shapes and size .
child-sized gas masks were also littered around , implying , perhaps , that some children came back to school on the monday after the explosion , before they were evacuated .
urban jungle 0800 -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone .
wild boar , wolves , lynx , red and roe deer and moose , for example .
we saw two moose yesterday and are hoping to see a species introduced by scientists - przewalski 's horse - today .
european bison have been reintroduced in the belarusian section of the zone .
wild boar are sometimes seen in the town of chernobyl where we are staying , where they churn up the orchards of unoccupied houses .
this method of feeding - basically , using their snout as a plough - can make them highly radioactive , as most contaminants are now located in the soil .
we have not seen boars or wolves , but have heard a few stories about them .
a pack of wolves is sometimes seen on the territory of the power station itself .
workers at a nuclear fuel storage site , currently under construction , say wolves killed a boar right by their perimeter fence just two weeks ago , and sat there eating it for days .
in another story , told by a driver , the killer was a man - a friend of his who went hunting in the zone and shot a 180kg boar .
it 's hard to get a licence to hunt in the zone but , according to our driver friend , poaching is widespread .
black storks and white-tailed eagles are among the birds that have made a comeback .
we hope to talk to at least one expert studying animals in the zone this weekend .
on our agenda today : an exploration of the town of chernobyl and the abandoned town of pripyat , built for workers at the nuclear plant , but uninhabited for 20 years .
we hear it 's turning , literally , into an urban jungle .
zone residents 30 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we find some elderly people who were evacuated from the zone in 1986 but insisted on returning .
in theory , the zone of alienation is also a zone of " mandatory resettlement " but the ukrainian authorities recognise it 's hard to keep old people out of homes they have lived in all their lives .
one 78-year-old woman says she wishes for just one thing - that her family would follow her back .
she has not seen her son 's family for more than a year - it 's hard for them to visit her from kiev , because they have no car and there is no public transport .
we decline the offer of something to eat , though not because the food would be contaminated - she buys most of it from grocers ' vans that visit her village of 30 people twice a week .
a slightly younger couple seem more content , and gladly show us their smallholding : chickens , a pig , some land sown with winter wheat , and other patches for potatoes and oats .
officials check their crops , and the water from their well , and have apparently given them a clean bill of health .
of more concern may be the wood they burn to heat their cottages .
some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .
life in the zone 29 march : 1200 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- we are back in the zone for the next two days , aiming to pursue some of the stories readers suggested .
we will try to talk to someone who refused to live outside the zone , and who defied the government by returning home to live on contaminated land .
we will see how nature is reclaiming the town of pripyat and the evacuated villages , and we will see what the contamination has done to the environment .
we also hope to see some of the wildlife that , we hear , is flourishing here in the absence of human interference .
our hotel in the town of chernobyl where all visitors to the zone are put up is a yellow building brought from finland in 1986 .
it is warm and there is a comforting smell of cooking food .
outside , snow is in full meltdown ...
lucky we brought our wellington boots .
shiny new reactor 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .
on either side , birch and pine and a forest floor of snow .
many villages seem not to have gas , judging from the stacks of firewood .
the older cottages are made of logs , and we pass the odd horse and cart , but finally we arrive at the nuclear power station .
if the chernobyl control room had something of a 60s retro feel - grey enamel surfaces , big plastic buttons , dim lighting - the bright magnolia-coloured control room of rivne 's fourth reactor is unmistakeably 21st century .
several computer screens , covered in pink and green symbols , stand in front of every desk .
-lrb- the software is ukrainian , we were told . -rrb-
security at rivne is pretty tight - no photography is allowed - and the staff exuded an air of efficiency and discipline .
none of the operators was smoking at the controls , anyway , as at least one was on our visit to chernobyl .
the director of the plant , nikolai fridman , does not want to knock the kind of reactor which blew up at chernobyl , the rbmk as it is known .
he points out that russia is successfully using 10 of them to this day .
yes , his pressurised water reactors at rivne are safer , but this is also a fairly old design .
the next two reactors built at the plant will be of a new generation , possibly a type he refers to as " fast neutron " .
he 's so busy thinking about the future , i ask if he ever remembers chernobyl .
" we think about it , we talk about it , we draw lessons from it .
we study it in institutes , and we are not the only ones , " he says .
for a moment i see chernobyl from the perspective of the nuclear power community - not -lrb- or not only -rrb- as a environmental and humanitarian disaster - but as a threat to the future of the industry .
when the world 's atomic power people get together they discuss chernobyl , three mile island and windscale , mr fridman says , and agree that such incidents must never be repeated .
0800 -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- today will be a vision of the future , unlike yesterday 's trip back in time .
we 're off to visit a new reactor that started generating last autumn .
foundations were laid in the 1980s , but work stopped after chernobyl - the last thing most ukrainians wanted was more nuclear power stations .
but a few years later , after the collapse of the ussr , russia announced that oil and gas would no longer be supplied free of charge .
ukraine decided nuclear power was good after all , and the reactor was completed .
at least a dozen more reactors are planned in the next 25 years .
zone of alienation .
28 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we 'll return to the zone for two days and a night later this week , and we are likely to meet some of the staff when we visit slavutych , the plant 's new dormitory town built from scratch after the disaster .
but we wo n't be going inside the plant again .
one strong impression : decommissioning a nuclear power station is not easy , especially when you have nowhere to put spent fuel and have to rely on international donors for cash .
but it 's as nothing compared with the task of making safe the wreckage of a ruined reactor .
the task at the moment is actually not so much making it safe , as making it safe enough for future generations to deal with .
the hope is that in 50 years ' time , people will have a better idea of what to do with the mess .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- : the chernobyl plant had four reactors .
it was the fourth that exploded , and which was later covered by a sarcophagus of steel and concrete .
we have just visited the control room of the first reactor , and talked to staff manning the controls .
the reactor has not generated electricity for 10 years , but the nuclear fuel has not been removed , and the safety and cooling systems are still in operation .
it 's like a patient on life support .
in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

reporter stephen mulvey and photographer phil coomes will publish their reports and picture galleries closer to the anniversary itself on 26 april .
this diary records their impressions as they gather facts and interview people affected by the tragedy .
they will be in ukraine until 5 april .
click here to see the stories you asked them to cover contamination confusion 2 april : 2300 -lrb- 2000 gmt -rrb- the effects of the chernobyl disaster were felt far beyond the limits of the 30km -lrb- 19 mile -rrb- zone around the plant .
reindeer as far away as the nordic countries and sheep in some british uplands became unfit for human consumption .
the land rendered uninhabitable also stretches out beyond the 30km mark , mainly to the north , in belarus , and to the west , in ukraine .
at the same time there are areas inside the 30km zone -lrb- mainly in the south -rrb- which are less contaminated than parts of kiev .
blame the weather for this .
the wind blew fallout in various directions before it fell to earth or was chucked down in rainstorms .
it took a while to draw up a good contamination map , but people needed to be evacuated quickly .
there was at least one case where people were moved from one of the cleaner villages inside the zone , to a more severely contaminated area outside it .
we met some people today who experienced a different problem , in some ways the reverse .
children we met while asking for directions to the village they lived outside the zone in a village that was only recognised as a radiation hotspot five years after the accident .
they were evacuated very late , to a newly-built village 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
the new homes were thrown up quickly and without sufficient care .
many suffer from subsidence .
sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye that what was once a horizontal line of bricks is now slanting down at one end .
cracked walls abound .
the fine wooden houses the villagers left behind were bulldozed to ensure they were never inhabited again .
only the cemetery there remains intact .
every family returns to it , the week after easter , for a picnic with their ancestors .
heroic efforts 1 april : 2100 -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- we talked today to two people whose lives have been touched by the chernobyl disaster , in completely different ways .
one founded a youth movement , aimed at teaching young people to care for the environment , before she had even entered her teens .
pictures show those who risked their lives trying to clean up chernobyl a professor gave a talk about chernobyl at her school , and she decided there and then that something should be done .
now 19 , she has already been doing it for several years .
she and her fellow activists visit schools to spread their message and organise out-of-school activities in their own suburb of kiev .
so , for example , if you ever come across a group of uniformed children cycling through woods on the outskirts of kiev on litter patrol , do n't be surprised .
the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .
he spent three days following instructions to pump water into the ruins , by which time he had soaked up so much radiation he would never be allowed to work in the nuclear industry again .
he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .
road signs recall the scores of villages that had to be evacuated we also visited kiev 's chornobyl museum -lrb- " chornobyl " being the ukrainian version of the russian " chernobyl " , which has become standard in english -rrb- .
the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .
a video shows , fleetingly , one of the six weddings that took place in pripyat on 26 april , hours after the explosion .
there is also footage recording the heroic efforts of miners to tunnel under the reactor so that a heat exchanger could be built to halt the progress of the molten reactor core , if it burned its way through the plant 's lower depths .
there are no postcards or souvenirs .
maybe it would be disrespectful if there were .
however , i suspect there would be a market for them .
mysterious gas masks 31 march : 2230 -lrb- 1930 gmt -rrb- the story of the gas masks in the nursery schools turns out to be more complicated than i thought .
the explosion at the power station happened at 0123 on a saturday morning .
life in pripyat continued pretty much as normal for the rest of the day , but the town was evacuated on the sunday .
there were no children left to go back to school on monday .
so ... where did the gas masks come from ?
vladimir usatenko , a former member of parliament who spent much of the 1990s drafting laws governing nuclear power , tells me that the gas masks were held in the school - as they were in all schools - for use in case of attack by the us and its allies .
stephen mulvey undergoes a radiation check after visiting the control room of the reactor they were dragged out of cupboards and scattered around the classrooms by people who visited the school long after the evacuation .
possibly even by unscrupulous journalists .
the guides who show visitors around the zone are working flat out as the 20th anniversary approaches .
we bumped into danish , finnish and german radio and tv crews , and saw others from a distance .
one of these other crews was covered from head to toe in protective gear , with only their eyes exposed .
this , surely , was for theatrical effect .
we wore disposable gloves if we touched anything that could have been contaminated , washed before eating and after returning to the hotel , and left our muddy wellington boots behind when we left .
we would have worn masks had the weather been dry and dusty .
we were checked for contaminants on leaving the zone , and found to be clean .
no show horses 1430 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- no przewalski 's horses were posing for photographers today , unfortunately .
a couple of weeks ago they were paying regular visits to a big haystack on the outskirts of town , provided by the chernobyl fire brigade .
but the weather has improved and they can find plenty to eat elsewhere .
part of a doll left behind at the nursery in pripyat by a child the horses , which originated in mongolia , became extinct in the wild in the 1960s , but have been successfully bred on a reserve in southern ukraine .
the chernobyl zone provided another area big enough for them to occupy comfortably , so they were introduced here too .
three years ago , according to wormwood forest , a natural history of the zone by american-ukrainian author mary mycio , there were 65 of them .
visiting pripyat is an unforgettable experience .
the nursery school was the most moving place we called at .
tiny shoes , dolls , a class photo album .
i came across a teaching plan for one class for the year 1985-86 .
it was filled in right up to 25 april , the day before the disaster .
the teachers had developed the children 's speaking ability by discussing a poem , the little flag , and gone on to practise counting , while at the same time consolidating their knowledge of colours , shapes and size .
child-sized gas masks were also littered around , implying , perhaps , that some children came back to school on the monday after the explosion , before they were evacuated .
urban jungle the harbour in the town of chernobyl 0800 -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone .
wild boar , wolves , lynx , red and roe deer and moose , for example .
we saw two moose yesterday and are hoping to see a species introduced by scientists - przewalski 's horse - today .
european bison have been reintroduced in the belarusian section of the zone .
wild boar are sometimes seen in the town of chernobyl where we are staying , where they churn up the orchards of unoccupied houses .
this method of feeding - basically , using their snout as a plough - can make them highly radioactive , as most contaminants are now located in the soil .
we have not seen boars or wolves , but have heard a few stories about them .
a pack of wolves is sometimes seen on the territory of the power station itself .
workers at a nuclear fuel storage site , currently under construction , say wolves killed a boar right by their perimeter fence just two weeks ago , and sat there eating it for days .
a moose spotted in the zone in another story , told by a driver , the killer was a man - a friend of his who went hunting in the zone and shot a 180kg boar .
it 's hard to get a licence to hunt in the zone but , according to our driver friend , poaching is widespread .
black storks and white-tailed eagles are among the birds that have made a comeback .
we hope to talk to at least one expert studying animals in the zone this weekend .
on our agenda today : an exploration of the town of chernobyl and the abandoned town of pripyat , built for workers at the nuclear plant , but uninhabited for 20 years .
we hear it 's turning , literally , into an urban jungle .
zone residents 30 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we find some elderly people who were evacuated from the zone in 1986 but insisted on returning .
in theory , the zone of alienation is also a zone of " mandatory resettlement " but the ukrainian authorities recognise it 's hard to keep old people out of homes they have lived in all their lives .
this woman would like her family to return to the zone , too one 78-year-old woman says she wishes for just one thing - that her family would follow her back .
she has not seen her son 's family for more than a year - it 's hard for them to visit her from kiev , because they have no car and there is no public transport .
we decline the offer of something to eat , though not because the food would be contaminated - she buys most of it from grocers ' vans that visit her village of 30 people twice a week .
a slightly younger couple seem more content , and gladly show us their smallholding : chickens , a pig , some land sown with winter wheat , and other patches for potatoes and oats .
officials check their crops , and the water from their well , and have apparently given them a clean bill of health .
of more concern may be the wood they burn to heat their cottages .
some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
some of the radioactive machinery will be decontaminated , some buried about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .
life in the zone the director of the new plant , nikolai fridman , talks about the future for the industry 29 march : 1200 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- we are back in the zone for the next two days , aiming to pursue some of the stories readers suggested .
we will try to talk to someone who refused to live outside the zone , and who defied the government by returning home to live on contaminated land .
we will see how nature is reclaiming the town of pripyat and the evacuated villages , and we will see what the contamination has done to the environment .
we also hope to see some of the wildlife that , we hear , is flourishing here in the absence of human interference .

it is warm and there is a comforting smell of cooking food .
outside , snow is in full meltdown ...
lucky we brought our wellington boots .
shiny new reactor view from the road en route to the rivne nuclear power station 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .

life in pripyat continued pretty much as normal for the rest of the day , but the town was evacuated on the sunday .
there were no children left to go back to school on monday .
so ... where did the gas masks come from ?
vladimir usatenko , a former member of parliament who spent much of the 1990s drafting laws governing nuclear power , tells me that the gas masks were held in the school - as they were in all schools - for use in case of attack by the us and its allies .
stephen mulvey undergoes a radiation check after visiting the control room of the reactor they were dragged out of cupboards and scattered around the classrooms by people who visited the school long after the evacuation .
possibly even by unscrupulous journalists .
the guides who show visitors around the zone are working flat out as the 20th anniversary approaches .
we bumped into danish , finnish and german radio and tv crews , and saw others from a distance .
one of these other crews was covered from head to toe in protective gear , with only their eyes exposed .
this , surely , was for theatrical effect .
we wore disposable gloves if we touched anything that could have been contaminated , washed before eating and after returning to the hotel , and left our muddy wellington boots behind when we left .
we would have worn masks had the weather been dry and dusty .
we were checked for contaminants on leaving the zone , and found to be clean .
no show horses 1430 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- no przewalski 's horses were posing for photographers today , unfortunately .
a couple of weeks ago they were paying regular visits to a big haystack on the outskirts of town , provided by the chernobyl fire brigade .
but the weather has improved and they can find plenty to eat elsewhere .
part of a doll left behind at the nursery in pripyat by a child the horses , which originated in mongolia , became extinct in the wild in the 1960s , but have been successfully bred on a reserve in southern ukraine .
the chernobyl zone provided another area big enough for them to occupy comfortably , so they were introduced here too .
three years ago , according to wormwood forest , a natural history of the zone by american-ukrainian author mary mycio , there were 65 of them .
visiting pripyat is an unforgettable experience .
the nursery school was the most moving place we called at .
tiny shoes , dolls , a class photo album .
i came across a teaching plan for one class for the year 1985-86 .
it was filled in right up to 25 april , the day before the disaster .
the teachers had developed the children 's speaking ability by discussing a poem , the little flag , and gone on to practise counting , while at the same time consolidating their knowledge of colours , shapes and size .
child-sized gas masks were also littered around , implying , perhaps , that some children came back to school on the monday after the explosion , before they were evacuated .
urban jungle the harbour in the town of chernobyl 0800 -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone .
wild boar , wolves , lynx , red and roe deer and moose , for example .
we saw two moose yesterday and are hoping to see a species introduced by scientists - przewalski 's horse - today .
european bison have been reintroduced in the belarusian section of the zone .
wild boar are sometimes seen in the town of chernobyl where we are staying , where they churn up the orchards of unoccupied houses .
this method of feeding - basically , using their snout as a plough - can make them highly radioactive , as most contaminants are now located in the soil .
we have not seen boars or wolves , but have heard a few stories about them .
a pack of wolves is sometimes seen on the territory of the power station itself .
workers at a nuclear fuel storage site , currently under construction , say wolves killed a boar right by their perimeter fence just two weeks ago , and sat there eating it for days .
a moose spotted in the zone in another story , told by a driver , the killer was a man - a friend of his who went hunting in the zone and shot a 180kg boar .
it 's hard to get a licence to hunt in the zone but , according to our driver friend , poaching is widespread .
black storks and white-tailed eagles are among the birds that have made a comeback .
we hope to talk to at least one expert studying animals in the zone this weekend .
on our agenda today : an exploration of the town of chernobyl and the abandoned town of pripyat , built for workers at the nuclear plant , but uninhabited for 20 years .
we hear it 's turning , literally , into an urban jungle .
zone residents 30 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we find some elderly people who were evacuated from the zone in 1986 but insisted on returning .
in theory , the zone of alienation is also a zone of " mandatory resettlement " but the ukrainian authorities recognise it 's hard to keep old people out of homes they have lived in all their lives .
this woman would like her family to return to the zone , too one 78-year-old woman says she wishes for just one thing - that her family would follow her back .
she has not seen her son 's family for more than a year - it 's hard for them to visit her from kiev , because they have no car and there is no public transport .
we decline the offer of something to eat , though not because the food would be contaminated - she buys most of it from grocers ' vans that visit her village of 30 people twice a week .
a slightly younger couple seem more content , and gladly show us their smallholding : chickens , a pig , some land sown with winter wheat , and other patches for potatoes and oats .
officials check their crops , and the water from their well , and have apparently given them a clean bill of health .
of more concern may be the wood they burn to heat their cottages .
some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
some of the radioactive machinery will be decontaminated , some buried about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .
life in the zone the director of the new plant , nikolai fridman , talks about the future for the industry 29 march : 1200 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- we are back in the zone for the next two days , aiming to pursue some of the stories readers suggested .
we will try to talk to someone who refused to live outside the zone , and who defied the government by returning home to live on contaminated land .
we will see how nature is reclaiming the town of pripyat and the evacuated villages , and we will see what the contamination has done to the environment .
we also hope to see some of the wildlife that , we hear , is flourishing here in the absence of human interference .
our hotel in the town of chernobyl where all visitors to the zone are put up is a yellow building brought from finland in 1986 .
it is warm and there is a comforting smell of cooking food .
outside , snow is in full meltdown ...
lucky we brought our wellington boots .
shiny new reactor view from the road en route to the rivne nuclear power station 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .
on either side , birch and pine and a forest floor of snow .
many villages seem not to have gas , judging from the stacks of firewood .
the older cottages are made of logs , and we pass the odd horse and cart , but finally we arrive at the nuclear power station .
if the chernobyl control room had something of a 60s retro feel - grey enamel surfaces , big plastic buttons , dim lighting - the bright magnolia-coloured control room of rivne 's fourth reactor is unmistakeably 21st century .
several computer screens , covered in pink and green symbols , stand in front of every desk .
-lrb- the software is ukrainian , we were told . -rrb-
security at rivne is pretty tight - no photography is allowed - and the staff exuded an air of efficiency and discipline .
none of the operators was smoking at the controls , anyway , as at least one was on our visit to chernobyl .
the director of the plant , nikolai fridman , does not want to knock the kind of reactor which blew up at chernobyl , the rbmk as it is known .
stephen and phil at the chernobyl plant he points out that russia is successfully using 10 of them to this day .
yes , his pressurised water reactors at rivne are safer , but this is also a fairly old design .
the next two reactors built at the plant will be of a new generation , possibly a type he refers to as " fast neutron " .
he 's so busy thinking about the future , i ask if he ever remembers chernobyl .
" we think about it , we talk about it , we draw lessons from it .
we study it in institutes , and we are not the only ones , " he says .
for a moment i see chernobyl from the perspective of the nuclear power community - not -lrb- or not only -rrb- as a environmental and humanitarian disaster - but as a threat to the future of the industry .
when the world 's atomic power people get together they discuss chernobyl , three mile island and windscale , mr fridman says , and agree that such incidents must never be repeated .
entering the zone 0800 -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- today will be a vision of the future , unlike yesterday 's trip back in time .
we 're off to visit a new reactor that started generating last autumn .
foundations were laid in the 1980s , but work stopped after chernobyl - the last thing most ukrainians wanted was more nuclear power stations .
but a few years later , after the collapse of the ussr , russia announced that oil and gas would no longer be supplied free of charge .
ukraine decided nuclear power was good after all , and the reactor was completed .
at least a dozen more reactors are planned in the next 25 years .
zone of alienation .
28 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we 'll return to the zone for two days and a night later this week , and we are likely to meet some of the staff when we visit slavutych , the plant 's new dormitory town built from scratch after the disaster .
but we wo n't be going inside the plant again .
one strong impression : decommissioning a nuclear power station is not easy , especially when you have nowhere to put spent fuel and have to rely on international donors for cash .
but it 's as nothing compared with the task of making safe the wreckage of a ruined reactor .
the task at the moment is actually not so much making it safe , as making it safe enough for future generations to deal with .
the hope is that in 50 years ' time , people will have a better idea of what to do with the mess .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- : the chernobyl plant had four reactors .
it was the fourth that exploded , and which was later covered by a sarcophagus of steel and concrete .
we have just visited the control room of the first reactor , and talked to staff manning the controls .
the reactor has not generated electricity for 10 years , but the nuclear fuel has not been removed , and the safety and cooling systems are still in operation .
it 's like a patient on life support .
in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

reporter stephen mulvey and photographer phil coomes will publish their reports and picture galleries closer to the anniversary itself on 26 april .
this diary records their impressions as they gather facts and interview people affected by the tragedy .
they will be in ukraine until 5 april .
click here to see the stories you asked them to cover contamination confusion 2 april : 2300 -lrb- 2000 gmt -rrb- the effects of the chernobyl disaster were felt far beyond the limits of the 30km -lrb- 19 mile -rrb- zone around the plant .
reindeer as far away as the nordic countries and sheep in some british uplands became unfit for human consumption .
the land rendered uninhabitable also stretches out beyond the 30km mark , mainly to the north , in belarus , and to the west , in ukraine .
at the same time there are areas inside the 30km zone -lrb- mainly in the south -rrb- which are less contaminated than parts of kiev .
blame the weather for this .
the wind blew fallout in various directions before it fell to earth or was chucked down in rainstorms .
it took a while to draw up a good contamination map , but people needed to be evacuated quickly .
there was at least one case where people were moved from one of the cleaner villages inside the zone , to a more severely contaminated area outside it .
we met some people today who experienced a different problem , in some ways the reverse .
children we met while asking for directions to the village they lived outside the zone in a village that was only recognised as a radiation hotspot five years after the accident .
they were evacuated very late , to a newly-built village 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
the new homes were thrown up quickly and without sufficient care .
many suffer from subsidence .
sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye that what was once a horizontal line of bricks is now slanting down at one end .
cracked walls abound .
the fine wooden houses the villagers left behind were bulldozed to ensure they were never inhabited again .
only the cemetery there remains intact .
every family returns to it , the week after easter , for a picnic with their ancestors .
heroic efforts 1 april : 2100 -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- we talked today to two people whose lives have been touched by the chernobyl disaster , in completely different ways .
one founded a youth movement , aimed at teaching young people to care for the environment , before she had even entered her teens .
pictures show those who risked their lives trying to clean up chernobyl a professor gave a talk about chernobyl at her school , and she decided there and then that something should be done .
now 19 , she has already been doing it for several years .
she and her fellow activists visit schools to spread their message and organise out-of-school activities in their own suburb of kiev .
so , for example , if you ever come across a group of uniformed children cycling through woods on the outskirts of kiev on litter patrol , do n't be surprised .
the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .
he spent three days following instructions to pump water into the ruins , by which time he had soaked up so much radiation he would never be allowed to work in the nuclear industry again .
he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .
road signs recall the scores of villages that had to be evacuated we also visited kiev 's chornobyl museum -lrb- " chornobyl " being the ukrainian version of the russian " chernobyl " , which has become standard in english -rrb- .
the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .
a video shows , fleetingly , one of the six weddings that took place in pripyat on 26 april , hours after the explosion .
there is also footage recording the heroic efforts of miners to tunnel under the reactor so that a heat exchanger could be built to halt the progress of the molten reactor core , if it burned its way through the plant 's lower depths .
there are no postcards or souvenirs .
maybe it would be disrespectful if there were .
however , i suspect there would be a market for them .

in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

reporter stephen mulvey and photographer phil coomes will publish their reports and picture galleries closer to the anniversary itself on 26 april .
this diary records their impressions as they gather facts and interview people affected by the tragedy .
they will be in ukraine until 5 april .
click here to see the stories you asked them to cover contamination confusion 2 april : 2300 -lrb- 2000 gmt -rrb- the effects of the chernobyl disaster were felt far beyond the limits of the 30km -lrb- 19 mile -rrb- zone around the plant .
reindeer as far away as the nordic countries and sheep in some british uplands became unfit for human consumption .
the land rendered uninhabitable also stretches out beyond the 30km mark , mainly to the north , in belarus , and to the west , in ukraine .
at the same time there are areas inside the 30km zone -lrb- mainly in the south -rrb- which are less contaminated than parts of kiev .
blame the weather for this .
the wind blew fallout in various directions before it fell to earth or was chucked down in rainstorms .
it took a while to draw up a good contamination map , but people needed to be evacuated quickly .
there was at least one case where people were moved from one of the cleaner villages inside the zone , to a more severely contaminated area outside it .
we met some people today who experienced a different problem , in some ways the reverse .
children we met while asking for directions to the village they lived outside the zone in a village that was only recognised as a radiation hotspot five years after the accident .
they were evacuated very late , to a newly-built village 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
the new homes were thrown up quickly and without sufficient care .
many suffer from subsidence .
sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye that what was once a horizontal line of bricks is now slanting down at one end .
cracked walls abound .
the fine wooden houses the villagers left behind were bulldozed to ensure they were never inhabited again .
only the cemetery there remains intact .
every family returns to it , the week after easter , for a picnic with their ancestors .
heroic efforts 1 april : 2100 -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- we talked today to two people whose lives have been touched by the chernobyl disaster , in completely different ways .
one founded a youth movement , aimed at teaching young people to care for the environment , before she had even entered her teens .
pictures show those who risked their lives trying to clean up chernobyl a professor gave a talk about chernobyl at her school , and she decided there and then that something should be done .
now 19 , she has already been doing it for several years .
she and her fellow activists visit schools to spread their message and organise out-of-school activities in their own suburb of kiev .
so , for example , if you ever come across a group of uniformed children cycling through woods on the outskirts of kiev on litter patrol , do n't be surprised .
the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .
he spent three days following instructions to pump water into the ruins , by which time he had soaked up so much radiation he would never be allowed to work in the nuclear industry again .
he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .
road signs recall the scores of villages that had to be evacuated we also visited kiev 's chornobyl museum -lrb- " chornobyl " being the ukrainian version of the russian " chernobyl " , which has become standard in english -rrb- .
the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .
a video shows , fleetingly , one of the six weddings that took place in pripyat on 26 april , hours after the explosion .
there is also footage recording the heroic efforts of miners to tunnel under the reactor so that a heat exchanger could be built to halt the progress of the molten reactor core , if it burned its way through the plant 's lower depths .
there are no postcards or souvenirs .
maybe it would be disrespectful if there were .
however , i suspect there would be a market for them .
mysterious gas masks 31 march : 2230 -lrb- 1930 gmt -rrb- the story of the gas masks in the nursery schools turns out to be more complicated than i thought .
the explosion at the power station happened at 0123 on a saturday morning .
life in pripyat continued pretty much as normal for the rest of the day , but the town was evacuated on the sunday .
there were no children left to go back to school on monday .
so ... where did the gas masks come from ?
vladimir usatenko , a former member of parliament who spent much of the 1990s drafting laws governing nuclear power , tells me that the gas masks were held in the school - as they were in all schools - for use in case of attack by the us and its allies .
stephen mulvey undergoes a radiation check after visiting the control room of the reactor they were dragged out of cupboards and scattered around the classrooms by people who visited the school long after the evacuation .
possibly even by unscrupulous journalists .
the guides who show visitors around the zone are working flat out as the 20th anniversary approaches .
we bumped into danish , finnish and german radio and tv crews , and saw others from a distance .
one of these other crews was covered from head to toe in protective gear , with only their eyes exposed .
this , surely , was for theatrical effect .
we wore disposable gloves if we touched anything that could have been contaminated , washed before eating and after returning to the hotel , and left our muddy wellington boots behind when we left .
we would have worn masks had the weather been dry and dusty .
we were checked for contaminants on leaving the zone , and found to be clean .
no show horses 1430 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- no przewalski 's horses were posing for photographers today , unfortunately .
a couple of weeks ago they were paying regular visits to a big haystack on the outskirts of town , provided by the chernobyl fire brigade .
but the weather has improved and they can find plenty to eat elsewhere .
part of a doll left behind at the nursery in pripyat by a child the horses , which originated in mongolia , became extinct in the wild in the 1960s , but have been successfully bred on a reserve in southern ukraine .
the chernobyl zone provided another area big enough for them to occupy comfortably , so they were introduced here too .
three years ago , according to wormwood forest , a natural history of the zone by american-ukrainian author mary mycio , there were 65 of them .
visiting pripyat is an unforgettable experience .
the nursery school was the most moving place we called at .
tiny shoes , dolls , a class photo album .
i came across a teaching plan for one class for the year 1985-86 .
it was filled in right up to 25 april , the day before the disaster .
the teachers had developed the children 's speaking ability by discussing a poem , the little flag , and gone on to practise counting , while at the same time consolidating their knowledge of colours , shapes and size .
child-sized gas masks were also littered around , implying , perhaps , that some children came back to school on the monday after the explosion , before they were evacuated .
urban jungle the harbour in the town of chernobyl 0800 -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone .
wild boar , wolves , lynx , red and roe deer and moose , for example .
we saw two moose yesterday and are hoping to see a species introduced by scientists - przewalski 's horse - today .
european bison have been reintroduced in the belarusian section of the zone .
wild boar are sometimes seen in the town of chernobyl where we are staying , where they churn up the orchards of unoccupied houses .
this method of feeding - basically , using their snout as a plough - can make them highly radioactive , as most contaminants are now located in the soil .
we have not seen boars or wolves , but have heard a few stories about them .
a pack of wolves is sometimes seen on the territory of the power station itself .
workers at a nuclear fuel storage site , currently under construction , say wolves killed a boar right by their perimeter fence just two weeks ago , and sat there eating it for days .
a moose spotted in the zone in another story , told by a driver , the killer was a man - a friend of his who went hunting in the zone and shot a 180kg boar .
it 's hard to get a licence to hunt in the zone but , according to our driver friend , poaching is widespread .
black storks and white-tailed eagles are among the birds that have made a comeback .
we hope to talk to at least one expert studying animals in the zone this weekend .
on our agenda today : an exploration of the town of chernobyl and the abandoned town of pripyat , built for workers at the nuclear plant , but uninhabited for 20 years .
we hear it 's turning , literally , into an urban jungle .
zone residents 30 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we find some elderly people who were evacuated from the zone in 1986 but insisted on returning .
in theory , the zone of alienation is also a zone of " mandatory resettlement " but the ukrainian authorities recognise it 's hard to keep old people out of homes they have lived in all their lives .
this woman would like her family to return to the zone , too one 78-year-old woman says she wishes for just one thing - that her family would follow her back .
she has not seen her son 's family for more than a year - it 's hard for them to visit her from kiev , because they have no car and there is no public transport .
we decline the offer of something to eat , though not because the food would be contaminated - she buys most of it from grocers ' vans that visit her village of 30 people twice a week .
a slightly younger couple seem more content , and gladly show us their smallholding : chickens , a pig , some land sown with winter wheat , and other patches for potatoes and oats .
officials check their crops , and the water from their well , and have apparently given them a clean bill of health .
of more concern may be the wood they burn to heat their cottages .
some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
some of the radioactive machinery will be decontaminated , some buried about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .
life in the zone the director of the new plant , nikolai fridman , talks about the future for the industry 29 march : 1200 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- we are back in the zone for the next two days , aiming to pursue some of the stories readers suggested .
we will try to talk to someone who refused to live outside the zone , and who defied the government by returning home to live on contaminated land .
we will see how nature is reclaiming the town of pripyat and the evacuated villages , and we will see what the contamination has done to the environment .
we also hope to see some of the wildlife that , we hear , is flourishing here in the absence of human interference .
our hotel in the town of chernobyl where all visitors to the zone are put up is a yellow building brought from finland in 1986 .
it is warm and there is a comforting smell of cooking food .
outside , snow is in full meltdown ...
lucky we brought our wellington boots .
shiny new reactor view from the road en route to the rivne nuclear power station 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .
on either side , birch and pine and a forest floor of snow .
many villages seem not to have gas , judging from the stacks of firewood .
the older cottages are made of logs , and we pass the odd horse and cart , but finally we arrive at the nuclear power station .
if the chernobyl control room had something of a 60s retro feel - grey enamel surfaces , big plastic buttons , dim lighting - the bright magnolia-coloured control room of rivne 's fourth reactor is unmistakeably 21st century .
several computer screens , covered in pink and green symbols , stand in front of every desk .
-lrb- the software is ukrainian , we were told . -rrb-
security at rivne is pretty tight - no photography is allowed - and the staff exuded an air of efficiency and discipline .
none of the operators was smoking at the controls , anyway , as at least one was on our visit to chernobyl .
the director of the plant , nikolai fridman , does not want to knock the kind of reactor which blew up at chernobyl , the rbmk as it is known .
stephen and phil at the chernobyl plant he points out that russia is successfully using 10 of them to this day .
yes , his pressurised water reactors at rivne are safer , but this is also a fairly old design .
the next two reactors built at the plant will be of a new generation , possibly a type he refers to as " fast neutron " .
he 's so busy thinking about the future , i ask if he ever remembers chernobyl .
" we think about it , we talk about it , we draw lessons from it .
we study it in institutes , and we are not the only ones , " he says .
for a moment i see chernobyl from the perspective of the nuclear power community - not -lrb- or not only -rrb- as a environmental and humanitarian disaster - but as a threat to the future of the industry .
when the world 's atomic power people get together they discuss chernobyl , three mile island and windscale , mr fridman says , and agree that such incidents must never be repeated .
entering the zone 0800 -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- today will be a vision of the future , unlike yesterday 's trip back in time .
we 're off to visit a new reactor that started generating last autumn .
foundations were laid in the 1980s , but work stopped after chernobyl - the last thing most ukrainians wanted was more nuclear power stations .
but a few years later , after the collapse of the ussr , russia announced that oil and gas would no longer be supplied free of charge .
ukraine decided nuclear power was good after all , and the reactor was completed .
at least a dozen more reactors are planned in the next 25 years .
zone of alienation .
28 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we 'll return to the zone for two days and a night later this week , and we are likely to meet some of the staff when we visit slavutych , the plant 's new dormitory town built from scratch after the disaster .
but we wo n't be going inside the plant again .
one strong impression : decommissioning a nuclear power station is not easy , especially when you have nowhere to put spent fuel and have to rely on international donors for cash .
but it 's as nothing compared with the task of making safe the wreckage of a ruined reactor .
the task at the moment is actually not so much making it safe , as making it safe enough for future generations to deal with .
the hope is that in 50 years ' time , people will have a better idea of what to do with the mess .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- : the chernobyl plant had four reactors .
it was the fourth that exploded , and which was later covered by a sarcophagus of steel and concrete .
we have just visited the control room of the first reactor , and talked to staff manning the controls .
the reactor has not generated electricity for 10 years , but the nuclear fuel has not been removed , and the safety and cooling systems are still in operation .
it 's like a patient on life support .
in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
some of the radioactive machinery will be decontaminated , some buried about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .
life in the zone the director of the new plant , nikolai fridman , talks about the future for the industry 29 march : 1200 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- we are back in the zone for the next two days , aiming to pursue some of the stories readers suggested .
we will try to talk to someone who refused to live outside the zone , and who defied the government by returning home to live on contaminated land .
we will see how nature is reclaiming the town of pripyat and the evacuated villages , and we will see what the contamination has done to the environment .
we also hope to see some of the wildlife that , we hear , is flourishing here in the absence of human interference .
our hotel in the town of chernobyl where all visitors to the zone are put up is a yellow building brought from finland in 1986 .
it is warm and there is a comforting smell of cooking food .
outside , snow is in full meltdown ...
lucky we brought our wellington boots .
shiny new reactor view from the road en route to the rivne nuclear power station 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .
on either side , birch and pine and a forest floor of snow .
many villages seem not to have gas , judging from the stacks of firewood .
the older cottages are made of logs , and we pass the odd horse and cart , but finally we arrive at the nuclear power station .
if the chernobyl control room had something of a 60s retro feel - grey enamel surfaces , big plastic buttons , dim lighting - the bright magnolia-coloured control room of rivne 's fourth reactor is unmistakeably 21st century .
several computer screens , covered in pink and green symbols , stand in front of every desk .
-lrb- the software is ukrainian , we were told . -rrb-
security at rivne is pretty tight - no photography is allowed - and the staff exuded an air of efficiency and discipline .
none of the operators was smoking at the controls , anyway , as at least one was on our visit to chernobyl .
the director of the plant , nikolai fridman , does not want to knock the kind of reactor which blew up at chernobyl , the rbmk as it is known .
stephen and phil at the chernobyl plant he points out that russia is successfully using 10 of them to this day .
yes , his pressurised water reactors at rivne are safer , but this is also a fairly old design .
the next two reactors built at the plant will be of a new generation , possibly a type he refers to as " fast neutron " .
he 's so busy thinking about the future , i ask if he ever remembers chernobyl .
" we think about it , we talk about it , we draw lessons from it .
we study it in institutes , and we are not the only ones , " he says .
for a moment i see chernobyl from the perspective of the nuclear power community - not -lrb- or not only -rrb- as a environmental and humanitarian disaster - but as a threat to the future of the industry .
when the world 's atomic power people get together they discuss chernobyl , three mile island and windscale , mr fridman says , and agree that such incidents must never be repeated .
entering the zone 0800 -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- today will be a vision of the future , unlike yesterday 's trip back in time .
we 're off to visit a new reactor that started generating last autumn .
foundations were laid in the 1980s , but work stopped after chernobyl - the last thing most ukrainians wanted was more nuclear power stations .
but a few years later , after the collapse of the ussr , russia announced that oil and gas would no longer be supplied free of charge .
ukraine decided nuclear power was good after all , and the reactor was completed .
at least a dozen more reactors are planned in the next 25 years .
zone of alienation .
28 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we 'll return to the zone for two days and a night later this week , and we are likely to meet some of the staff when we visit slavutych , the plant 's new dormitory town built from scratch after the disaster .
but we wo n't be going inside the plant again .
one strong impression : decommissioning a nuclear power station is not easy , especially when you have nowhere to put spent fuel and have to rely on international donors for cash .
but it 's as nothing compared with the task of making safe the wreckage of a ruined reactor .
the task at the moment is actually not so much making it safe , as making it safe enough for future generations to deal with .
the hope is that in 50 years ' time , people will have a better idea of what to do with the mess .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- : the chernobyl plant had four reactors .
it was the fourth that exploded , and which was later covered by a sarcophagus of steel and concrete .
we have just visited the control room of the first reactor , and talked to staff manning the controls .
the reactor has not generated electricity for 10 years , but the nuclear fuel has not been removed , and the safety and cooling systems are still in operation .
it 's like a patient on life support .
in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

reporter stephen mulvey and photographer phil coomes will publish their reports and picture galleries closer to the anniversary itself on 26 april .
this diary records their impressions as they gather facts and interview people affected by the tragedy .
they will be in ukraine until 5 april .
click here to see the stories you asked them to cover contamination confusion 2 april : 2300 -lrb- 2000 gmt -rrb- the effects of the chernobyl disaster were felt far beyond the limits of the 30km -lrb- 19 mile -rrb- zone around the plant .
reindeer as far away as the nordic countries and sheep in some british uplands became unfit for human consumption .
the land rendered uninhabitable also stretches out beyond the 30km mark , mainly to the north , in belarus , and to the west , in ukraine .
at the same time there are areas inside the 30km zone -lrb- mainly in the south -rrb- which are less contaminated than parts of kiev .
blame the weather for this .
the wind blew fallout in various directions before it fell to earth or was chucked down in rainstorms .
it took a while to draw up a good contamination map , but people needed to be evacuated quickly .
there was at least one case where people were moved from one of the cleaner villages inside the zone , to a more severely contaminated area outside it .
we met some people today who experienced a different problem , in some ways the reverse .
children we met while asking for directions to the village they lived outside the zone in a village that was only recognised as a radiation hotspot five years after the accident .
they were evacuated very late , to a newly-built village 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
the new homes were thrown up quickly and without sufficient care .
many suffer from subsidence .
sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye that what was once a horizontal line of bricks is now slanting down at one end .
cracked walls abound .
the fine wooden houses the villagers left behind were bulldozed to ensure they were never inhabited again .
only the cemetery there remains intact .
every family returns to it , the week after easter , for a picnic with their ancestors .
heroic efforts 1 april : 2100 -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- we talked today to two people whose lives have been touched by the chernobyl disaster , in completely different ways .
one founded a youth movement , aimed at teaching young people to care for the environment , before she had even entered her teens .
pictures show those who risked their lives trying to clean up chernobyl a professor gave a talk about chernobyl at her school , and she decided there and then that something should be done .
now 19 , she has already been doing it for several years .
she and her fellow activists visit schools to spread their message and organise out-of-school activities in their own suburb of kiev .
so , for example , if you ever come across a group of uniformed children cycling through woods on the outskirts of kiev on litter patrol , do n't be surprised .
the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .
he spent three days following instructions to pump water into the ruins , by which time he had soaked up so much radiation he would never be allowed to work in the nuclear industry again .
he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .
road signs recall the scores of villages that had to be evacuated we also visited kiev 's chornobyl museum -lrb- " chornobyl " being the ukrainian version of the russian " chernobyl " , which has become standard in english -rrb- .
the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .
a video shows , fleetingly , one of the six weddings that took place in pripyat on 26 april , hours after the explosion .
there is also footage recording the heroic efforts of miners to tunnel under the reactor so that a heat exchanger could be built to halt the progress of the molten reactor core , if it burned its way through the plant 's lower depths .
there are no postcards or souvenirs .
maybe it would be disrespectful if there were .
however , i suspect there would be a market for them .
mysterious gas masks 31 march : 2230 -lrb- 1930 gmt -rrb- the story of the gas masks in the nursery schools turns out to be more complicated than i thought .
the explosion at the power station happened at 0123 on a saturday morning .
life in pripyat continued pretty much as normal for the rest of the day , but the town was evacuated on the sunday .
there were no children left to go back to school on monday .
so ... where did the gas masks come from ?
vladimir usatenko , a former member of parliament who spent much of the 1990s drafting laws governing nuclear power , tells me that the gas masks were held in the school - as they were in all schools - for use in case of attack by the us and its allies .
stephen mulvey undergoes a radiation check after visiting the control room of the reactor they were dragged out of cupboards and scattered around the classrooms by people who visited the school long after the evacuation .
possibly even by unscrupulous journalists .
the guides who show visitors around the zone are working flat out as the 20th anniversary approaches .
we bumped into danish , finnish and german radio and tv crews , and saw others from a distance .
one of these other crews was covered from head to toe in protective gear , with only their eyes exposed .
this , surely , was for theatrical effect .
we wore disposable gloves if we touched anything that could have been contaminated , washed before eating and after returning to the hotel , and left our muddy wellington boots behind when we left .
we would have worn masks had the weather been dry and dusty .
we were checked for contaminants on leaving the zone , and found to be clean .
no show horses 1430 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- no przewalski 's horses were posing for photographers today , unfortunately .
a couple of weeks ago they were paying regular visits to a big haystack on the outskirts of town , provided by the chernobyl fire brigade .
but the weather has improved and they can find plenty to eat elsewhere .
part of a doll left behind at the nursery in pripyat by a child the horses , which originated in mongolia , became extinct in the wild in the 1960s , but have been successfully bred on a reserve in southern ukraine .
the chernobyl zone provided another area big enough for them to occupy comfortably , so they were introduced here too .
three years ago , according to wormwood forest , a natural history of the zone by american-ukrainian author mary mycio , there were 65 of them .
visiting pripyat is an unforgettable experience .
the nursery school was the most moving place we called at .
tiny shoes , dolls , a class photo album .
i came across a teaching plan for one class for the year 1985-86 .
it was filled in right up to 25 april , the day before the disaster .
the teachers had developed the children 's speaking ability by discussing a poem , the little flag , and gone on to practise counting , while at the same time consolidating their knowledge of colours , shapes and size .
child-sized gas masks were also littered around , implying , perhaps , that some children came back to school on the monday after the explosion , before they were evacuated .
urban jungle the harbour in the town of chernobyl 0800 -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone .
wild boar , wolves , lynx , red and roe deer and moose , for example .
we saw two moose yesterday and are hoping to see a species introduced by scientists - przewalski 's horse - today .
european bison have been reintroduced in the belarusian section of the zone .
wild boar are sometimes seen in the town of chernobyl where we are staying , where they churn up the orchards of unoccupied houses .
this method of feeding - basically , using their snout as a plough - can make them highly radioactive , as most contaminants are now located in the soil .
we have not seen boars or wolves , but have heard a few stories about them .
a pack of wolves is sometimes seen on the territory of the power station itself .
workers at a nuclear fuel storage site , currently under construction , say wolves killed a boar right by their perimeter fence just two weeks ago , and sat there eating it for days .
a moose spotted in the zone in another story , told by a driver , the killer was a man - a friend of his who went hunting in the zone and shot a 180kg boar .
it 's hard to get a licence to hunt in the zone but , according to our driver friend , poaching is widespread .
black storks and white-tailed eagles are among the birds that have made a comeback .
we hope to talk to at least one expert studying animals in the zone this weekend .
on our agenda today : an exploration of the town of chernobyl and the abandoned town of pripyat , built for workers at the nuclear plant , but uninhabited for 20 years .
we hear it 's turning , literally , into an urban jungle .
zone residents 30 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we find some elderly people who were evacuated from the zone in 1986 but insisted on returning .
in theory , the zone of alienation is also a zone of " mandatory resettlement " but the ukrainian authorities recognise it 's hard to keep old people out of homes they have lived in all their lives .
this woman would like her family to return to the zone , too one 78-year-old woman says she wishes for just one thing - that her family would follow her back .
she has not seen her son 's family for more than a year - it 's hard for them to visit her from kiev , because they have no car and there is no public transport .
we decline the offer of something to eat , though not because the food would be contaminated - she buys most of it from grocers ' vans that visit her village of 30 people twice a week .
a slightly younger couple seem more content , and gladly show us their smallholding : chickens , a pig , some land sown with winter wheat , and other patches for potatoes and oats .
officials check their crops , and the water from their well , and have apparently given them a clean bill of health .
of more concern may be the wood they burn to heat their cottages .
some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
some of the radioactive machinery will be decontaminated , some buried about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .

the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .
he spent three days following instructions to pump water into the ruins , by which time he had soaked up so much radiation he would never be allowed to work in the nuclear industry again .
he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .
road signs recall the scores of villages that had to be evacuated we also visited kiev 's chornobyl museum -lrb- " chornobyl " being the ukrainian version of the russian " chernobyl " , which has become standard in english -rrb- .
the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .
a video shows , fleetingly , one of the six weddings that took place in pripyat on 26 april , hours after the explosion .
there is also footage recording the heroic efforts of miners to tunnel under the reactor so that a heat exchanger could be built to halt the progress of the molten reactor core , if it burned its way through the plant 's lower depths .
there are no postcards or souvenirs .
maybe it would be disrespectful if there were .
however , i suspect there would be a market for them .
mysterious gas masks 31 march : 2230 -lrb- 1930 gmt -rrb- the story of the gas masks in the nursery schools turns out to be more complicated than i thought .
the explosion at the power station happened at 0123 on a saturday morning .
life in pripyat continued pretty much as normal for the rest of the day , but the town was evacuated on the sunday .
there were no children left to go back to school on monday .
so ... where did the gas masks come from ?
vladimir usatenko , a former member of parliament who spent much of the 1990s drafting laws governing nuclear power , tells me that the gas masks were held in the school - as they were in all schools - for use in case of attack by the us and its allies .
stephen mulvey undergoes a radiation check after visiting the control room of the reactor they were dragged out of cupboards and scattered around the classrooms by people who visited the school long after the evacuation .
possibly even by unscrupulous journalists .
the guides who show visitors around the zone are working flat out as the 20th anniversary approaches .
we bumped into danish , finnish and german radio and tv crews , and saw others from a distance .
one of these other crews was covered from head to toe in protective gear , with only their eyes exposed .
this , surely , was for theatrical effect .
we wore disposable gloves if we touched anything that could have been contaminated , washed before eating and after returning to the hotel , and left our muddy wellington boots behind when we left .
we would have worn masks had the weather been dry and dusty .
we were checked for contaminants on leaving the zone , and found to be clean .
no show horses 1430 -lrb- 1130 gmt -rrb- no przewalski 's horses were posing for photographers today , unfortunately .
a couple of weeks ago they were paying regular visits to a big haystack on the outskirts of town , provided by the chernobyl fire brigade .
but the weather has improved and they can find plenty to eat elsewhere .
part of a doll left behind at the nursery in pripyat by a child the horses , which originated in mongolia , became extinct in the wild in the 1960s , but have been successfully bred on a reserve in southern ukraine .
the chernobyl zone provided another area big enough for them to occupy comfortably , so they were introduced here too .
three years ago , according to wormwood forest , a natural history of the zone by american-ukrainian author mary mycio , there were 65 of them .
visiting pripyat is an unforgettable experience .
the nursery school was the most moving place we called at .
tiny shoes , dolls , a class photo album .
i came across a teaching plan for one class for the year 1985-86 .
it was filled in right up to 25 april , the day before the disaster .
the teachers had developed the children 's speaking ability by discussing a poem , the little flag , and gone on to practise counting , while at the same time consolidating their knowledge of colours , shapes and size .
child-sized gas masks were also littered around , implying , perhaps , that some children came back to school on the monday after the explosion , before they were evacuated .
urban jungle the harbour in the town of chernobyl 0800 -lrb- 0500gmt -rrb- a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone .
wild boar , wolves , lynx , red and roe deer and moose , for example .
we saw two moose yesterday and are hoping to see a species introduced by scientists - przewalski 's horse - today .
european bison have been reintroduced in the belarusian section of the zone .
wild boar are sometimes seen in the town of chernobyl where we are staying , where they churn up the orchards of unoccupied houses .
this method of feeding - basically , using their snout as a plough - can make them highly radioactive , as most contaminants are now located in the soil .
we have not seen boars or wolves , but have heard a few stories about them .
a pack of wolves is sometimes seen on the territory of the power station itself .
workers at a nuclear fuel storage site , currently under construction , say wolves killed a boar right by their perimeter fence just two weeks ago , and sat there eating it for days .
a moose spotted in the zone in another story , told by a driver , the killer was a man - a friend of his who went hunting in the zone and shot a 180kg boar .
it 's hard to get a licence to hunt in the zone but , according to our driver friend , poaching is widespread .
black storks and white-tailed eagles are among the birds that have made a comeback .
we hope to talk to at least one expert studying animals in the zone this weekend .
on our agenda today : an exploration of the town of chernobyl and the abandoned town of pripyat , built for workers at the nuclear plant , but uninhabited for 20 years .
we hear it 's turning , literally , into an urban jungle .
zone residents 30 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we find some elderly people who were evacuated from the zone in 1986 but insisted on returning .
in theory , the zone of alienation is also a zone of " mandatory resettlement " but the ukrainian authorities recognise it 's hard to keep old people out of homes they have lived in all their lives .
this woman would like her family to return to the zone , too one 78-year-old woman says she wishes for just one thing - that her family would follow her back .
she has not seen her son 's family for more than a year - it 's hard for them to visit her from kiev , because they have no car and there is no public transport .
we decline the offer of something to eat , though not because the food would be contaminated - she buys most of it from grocers ' vans that visit her village of 30 people twice a week .
a slightly younger couple seem more content , and gladly show us their smallholding : chickens , a pig , some land sown with winter wheat , and other patches for potatoes and oats .
officials check their crops , and the water from their well , and have apparently given them a clean bill of health .
of more concern may be the wood they burn to heat their cottages .
some trees absorb a lot of radiation , and it is said to get concentrated in the ash .
on the way back to the hotel we spot two moose resting in the snow about 50 yards from the road , half hidden by birch saplings and the odd fir tree .
we stop the car and look at them .
they look back , hoping we 'll go away .
we do n't , so they get to their feet , and a few moments later they bound off into the dusk .
waste problem 1700 -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- what to do with more than a million tonnes of radioactive waste is one of the many problems confronting the chernobyl authorities .
a lot of it was buried quickly in the aftermath of the disaster .
some of the radioactive machinery will be decontaminated , some buried about 460 burial sites have been properly identified and studied .
some of these have to be moved because they are too close to the pripyat river , and occasionally get covered by spring floods .
another 500 or so burial sites have yet to be found , 20 years after the disaster .
experts know roughly where they are , but not precisely , and they do n't know what they contain .
we walk through a graveyard for contaminated machinery , armoured personnel carriers , cranes and lorries .
some of these , ultimately , will be decontaminated and disposed of .
others will be buried - but the one site where they can be safely buried without contaminating the groundwater is nearly full .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- first stop , the red forest .
so called because the pine trees went red and died in response to a massive blast of radiation .
a wide variety of animal species has benefited from 20 years of peace and quiet in the zone they were scooped up and buried , along with tonnes of contaminated soil , but the area - which has now sprouted a new generation of trees - is still very " hot " in places .
standing on the road , rather than inside the forest , our dosimeters momentarily register a dose rate of two micro-sieverts an hour .
you soak up more radiation than that flying in an aeroplane at a height of 1,000m .
life in the zone the director of the new plant , nikolai fridman , talks about the future for the industry 29 march : 1200 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- we are back in the zone for the next two days , aiming to pursue some of the stories readers suggested .
we will try to talk to someone who refused to live outside the zone , and who defied the government by returning home to live on contaminated land .
we will see how nature is reclaiming the town of pripyat and the evacuated villages , and we will see what the contamination has done to the environment .
we also hope to see some of the wildlife that , we hear , is flourishing here in the absence of human interference .
our hotel in the town of chernobyl where all visitors to the zone are put up is a yellow building brought from finland in 1986 .
it is warm and there is a comforting smell of cooking food .
outside , snow is in full meltdown ...
lucky we brought our wellington boots .
shiny new reactor view from the road en route to the rivne nuclear power station 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .
on either side , birch and pine and a forest floor of snow .
many villages seem not to have gas , judging from the stacks of firewood .
the older cottages are made of logs , and we pass the odd horse and cart , but finally we arrive at the nuclear power station .
if the chernobyl control room had something of a 60s retro feel - grey enamel surfaces , big plastic buttons , dim lighting - the bright magnolia-coloured control room of rivne 's fourth reactor is unmistakeably 21st century .
several computer screens , covered in pink and green symbols , stand in front of every desk .
-lrb- the software is ukrainian , we were told . -rrb-
security at rivne is pretty tight - no photography is allowed - and the staff exuded an air of efficiency and discipline .
none of the operators was smoking at the controls , anyway , as at least one was on our visit to chernobyl .
the director of the plant , nikolai fridman , does not want to knock the kind of reactor which blew up at chernobyl , the rbmk as it is known .
stephen and phil at the chernobyl plant he points out that russia is successfully using 10 of them to this day .
yes , his pressurised water reactors at rivne are safer , but this is also a fairly old design .
the next two reactors built at the plant will be of a new generation , possibly a type he refers to as " fast neutron " .
he 's so busy thinking about the future , i ask if he ever remembers chernobyl .
" we think about it , we talk about it , we draw lessons from it .
we study it in institutes , and we are not the only ones , " he says .
for a moment i see chernobyl from the perspective of the nuclear power community - not -lrb- or not only -rrb- as a environmental and humanitarian disaster - but as a threat to the future of the industry .
when the world 's atomic power people get together they discuss chernobyl , three mile island and windscale , mr fridman says , and agree that such incidents must never be repeated .
entering the zone 0800 -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- today will be a vision of the future , unlike yesterday 's trip back in time .
we 're off to visit a new reactor that started generating last autumn .
foundations were laid in the 1980s , but work stopped after chernobyl - the last thing most ukrainians wanted was more nuclear power stations .
but a few years later , after the collapse of the ussr , russia announced that oil and gas would no longer be supplied free of charge .
ukraine decided nuclear power was good after all , and the reactor was completed .
at least a dozen more reactors are planned in the next 25 years .
zone of alienation .
28 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we 'll return to the zone for two days and a night later this week , and we are likely to meet some of the staff when we visit slavutych , the plant 's new dormitory town built from scratch after the disaster .
but we wo n't be going inside the plant again .
one strong impression : decommissioning a nuclear power station is not easy , especially when you have nowhere to put spent fuel and have to rely on international donors for cash .
but it 's as nothing compared with the task of making safe the wreckage of a ruined reactor .
the task at the moment is actually not so much making it safe , as making it safe enough for future generations to deal with .
the hope is that in 50 years ' time , people will have a better idea of what to do with the mess .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- : the chernobyl plant had four reactors .
it was the fourth that exploded , and which was later covered by a sarcophagus of steel and concrete .
we have just visited the control room of the first reactor , and talked to staff manning the controls .
the reactor has not generated electricity for 10 years , but the nuclear fuel has not been removed , and the safety and cooling systems are still in operation .
it 's like a patient on life support .
in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

reporter stephen mulvey and photographer phil coomes will publish their reports and picture galleries closer to the anniversary itself on 26 april .
this diary records their impressions as they gather facts and interview people affected by the tragedy .
they will be in ukraine until 5 april .
click here to see the stories you asked them to cover contamination confusion 2 april : 2300 -lrb- 2000 gmt -rrb- the effects of the chernobyl disaster were felt far beyond the limits of the 30km -lrb- 19 mile -rrb- zone around the plant .
reindeer as far away as the nordic countries and sheep in some british uplands became unfit for human consumption .
the land rendered uninhabitable also stretches out beyond the 30km mark , mainly to the north , in belarus , and to the west , in ukraine .
at the same time there are areas inside the 30km zone -lrb- mainly in the south -rrb- which are less contaminated than parts of kiev .
blame the weather for this .
the wind blew fallout in various directions before it fell to earth or was chucked down in rainstorms .
it took a while to draw up a good contamination map , but people needed to be evacuated quickly .
there was at least one case where people were moved from one of the cleaner villages inside the zone , to a more severely contaminated area outside it .
we met some people today who experienced a different problem , in some ways the reverse .
children we met while asking for directions to the village they lived outside the zone in a village that was only recognised as a radiation hotspot five years after the accident .
they were evacuated very late , to a newly-built village 40km -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
the new homes were thrown up quickly and without sufficient care .
many suffer from subsidence .
sometimes it can be seen with the naked eye that what was once a horizontal line of bricks is now slanting down at one end .
cracked walls abound .
the fine wooden houses the villagers left behind were bulldozed to ensure they were never inhabited again .
only the cemetery there remains intact .
every family returns to it , the week after easter , for a picnic with their ancestors .
heroic efforts 1 april : 2100 -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- we talked today to two people whose lives have been touched by the chernobyl disaster , in completely different ways .
one founded a youth movement , aimed at teaching young people to care for the environment , before she had even entered her teens .
pictures show those who risked their lives trying to clean up chernobyl a professor gave a talk about chernobyl at her school , and she decided there and then that something should be done .
now 19 , she has already been doing it for several years .
she and her fellow activists visit schools to spread their message and organise out-of-school activities in their own suburb of kiev .
so , for example , if you ever come across a group of uniformed children cycling through woods on the outskirts of kiev on litter patrol , do n't be surprised .
the other person we spoke to arrived for his shift at chernobyl 's fourth reactor on 26 april 1986 , and found it no longer existed .

he too has sought to " do something " about chernobyl - by joining a group of artists , which draws attention to society 's self-destructive potential .

the museum 's entrance hall and stairs are hung with the road signs that once told drivers they were entering or leaving 74 of the 112 evacuated villages in the zone .

shiny new reactor view from the road en route to the rivne nuclear power station 1600 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- we travel for 350km along the most direct road from kiev to warsaw - just one lane in each direction , pockmarked with potholes .

but a few years later , after the collapse of the ussr , russia announced that oil and gas would no longer be supplied free of charge .
ukraine decided nuclear power was good after all , and the reactor was completed .
at least a dozen more reactors are planned in the next 25 years .
zone of alienation .
28 march : 1900 -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- we 'll return to the zone for two days and a night later this week , and we are likely to meet some of the staff when we visit slavutych , the plant 's new dormitory town built from scratch after the disaster .
but we wo n't be going inside the plant again .
one strong impression : decommissioning a nuclear power station is not easy , especially when you have nowhere to put spent fuel and have to rely on international donors for cash .
but it 's as nothing compared with the task of making safe the wreckage of a ruined reactor .
the task at the moment is actually not so much making it safe , as making it safe enough for future generations to deal with .
the hope is that in 50 years ' time , people will have a better idea of what to do with the mess .
1500 -lrb- 1200 gmt -rrb- : the chernobyl plant had four reactors .
it was the fourth that exploded , and which was later covered by a sarcophagus of steel and concrete .
we have just visited the control room of the first reactor , and talked to staff manning the controls .
the reactor has not generated electricity for 10 years , but the nuclear fuel has not been removed , and the safety and cooling systems are still in operation .
it 's like a patient on life support .
in a viewing room overlooking the forbidding gunmetal-grey sarcophagus , we get our first noticeable dose of radiation .
actually , we do n't notice it , but our dosimeters do , notching up about two micro-sieverts in the space of 40 minutes .
we had almost begun to think they were not working .
1000 -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- : we 're in the zone , heading for the plant .
in our pockets we have radiation metres -lrb- dosimeters -rrb- , a bit smaller than a packet of cigarettes .
the zone is an area the size of greater london where ordinary life came to an end 20 years ago .
inhabitants were evacuated , checkpoints and fences went up , and nature took over .
it 's full name , literally translated from ukrainian , is zone of alienation .
when i last did this drive in 1993 , the overgrowth was beginning to engulf an abandoned village on the main road .
it was probably waist high .
since then birch trees have shot up everywhere .
the village is already becoming woodland again .
in a month , when the trees are in leaf , the houses will not be visible at all .

sir sean connery was the main attraction at this year 's dressed to kilt event as part of tartan week .
the invited audience of us and scottish " movers and shakers " were treated to an array of tartan fashions .
they were also given a glimpse of sir sean 's new £ 3m animated feature film , sir billi the vet .
sir sean shared the stage at one point with scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell .
relations between the former james bond actor , who champions independence for scotland , and mr mcconnell are reported to be strained but they shook hands briefly before watching the fashion show .
sir sean joked to the guests : " i am very happy to be back in new york and i must say that people here have been almost overly friendly , " in a reference to the city 's image of surliness .
the first minister was hoping to shrug off the memories of the criticism he took over the kilt he wore at the dressed to kilt event in 2004 when the image of him wearing a pin-striped black kilt and ghillie shirt was roundly mocked by fashion experts .
this year he wore a more traditional tartan along with a charcoal grey two-button argyle jacket designed by galashiels-based lochcarron .
he said : " i 'm very proud to once again be showing off the kilts of one of scotland 's finest companies here in new york .
" scotland 's designers are increasingly making a big impact internationally and the dressed to kilt fashion show gives a special opportunity to show off their work .
" as first minister i 'm always proud to play my part . "
' great ambassador ' also present was american millionaire donald trump , who presented sir sean with the first honorary membership of his proposed new golf course at balmedie in aberdeenshire .
mr trump said of the actor : " he is a great ambassador for scotland and a great man . "
mr trump is half-scottish and is keen to cement his scottish roots by building the golf and leisure development , which he hopes will one day host the open .
scottish golf star sam torrance was among those who stepped out on the catwalk .
he was joined by scotland rugby player chris cusiter , who played in the calcutta cup winning team which defeated england at murrayfield during the six nations championship .
he confessed to being nervous but declared : " i think it 's fantastic to see so many scottish people here .
" i was sitting in a restaurant across the road and two women decided to buy me a beer because of my kilt .
" i play rugby but this is a very different event .
there are a few good-looking male models through there - i 'm out of my depth . "
proceeds from the night go to friends of scotland , a charity dedicated to advancing scottish interests and meeting contemporary scottish needs in the us .

the confessions tour will start on 30 july , followed by two other uk dates at the wembley area .
it is the first time the 47-year-old singer - who has had 12 uk number one hits under her belt - has played in wales .
tickets for the cardiff gig will go on sale at 0900 bst on 21 april with prices starting at £ 80 .
madonna is the latest in a long line of bands and singers due to play at the venue this year including take that , the eagles and the rolling stones .
" this is a major coup , when we found out that madonna wanted to play here we knew this would be huge , " said paul sergeant , chief executive of the millennium stadium .
" we are delighted to have such an icon play at the millennium stadium and it is fantastic that we as a venue have been chosen to open madonna 's european leg of her world tour . "
mr sergeant told bbc news that staff at the stadium had been in negotiations over the gig " for months " .
" a lot of the time we do n't know who the act is when we first start talking - it only becomes apparent as time goes by as it was in this case , " he said .
" we 've got some big names this year , take that , the rolling stones , the eagles - we had oasis in december , but having madonna is just fantastic .
" she is arguably the biggest act in the world and it 's a major achievement for us to have secured her .
" i think the tickets are going to sell out in record time and i would n't be surprised to see people camping out for them because they are such hot tickets . "
in recent years , the stadium has become one of the major venues for sporting and music events .

the lower newtownards road , the lower shankill , crumlin road and the oldpark areas are expected to receive a share of between £ 25-35m in government money .
dup north belfast mp nigel dodds said it " must be used as a platform upon which we can build for the future " .
but the uup 's michael mcgimpsey said the money was " a drop in the ocean " .
the announcement is to be made by social development minister david hanson on tuesday .
bbc northern ireland home affairs correspondent vincent kearney said unionist politicians have told the government that protestant working class areas have " missed out " on any peace dividend from the good friday agreement .
" those claims reached a crescendo last september when violence erupted in a number of loyalist areas after the re-routing of the whiterock orange parade in west belfast , " he said .
' deprivation ' " unionist politicians said the violence was not simply a response to that decision - but a sign that loyalists felt marginalised and ignored .
" the government insists that this package is not a direct response to that violence , but part of a longer term strategy . "
speaking ahead of the announcement , mr dodds said that in the past , " those in positions of authority have turned a blind eye to what are often dire levels of deprivation " .
" the significance lies in the fact that there is at long last an acceptance that there are real and lasting problems in unionist parts of northern ireland , " he said .
' unfit housing ' however , mr mcgimpsey , a south belfast assembly member , said recent budget cuts in the belfast education and library board was evidence of a " topsy-turvy approach in tackling one of the biggest problems affecting loyalist areas " .
he added : " in the village area of south belfast , there are 1,300 unfit houses .
" the costs to redevelop this area has been calculated at £ 180m alone - £ 30m would not begin to deal with the levels of neglect that have been allowed to develop in these areas . "
pastor paul burns from sandy row in south belfast said the money must be channelled properly .
" they are going to need to take the people forward , and they are going to need an awful lot of help , an awful lot of technical assistance , " he said .
baroness may blood , who has been involved in cross-community and trade union work for more than 40 years , said it was important that the money was used to support existing programmes on a long-term basis .
she said it should also address skills training in loyalist areas .
" we have children in this area which the education system has failed ... we have to start as soon as possible and build up that love and interest in education , " she said .

uniformed highways agency traffic officers -lrb- hato -rrb- will work with devon and cornwall police to keep traffic moving and manage motorway accidents .
the aim of the patrols is to help free police resources to enable them to concentrate on tackling crime .
patrols are already operating on the m5 in the avon and somerset and gloucestershire police areas .
traffic officers will now also patrol the m5 from junction 26 to the start of the motorway at junction 31 in exeter .
the team will be supported by a 24-hour regional control centre in avonmouth .
summer visitors officers based at the control centre will also answer emergency roadside telephones on the m5 , a30 , a38 and a303 in devon and cornwall .
they will also set motorway warning signs to provide information for drivers .
the control centre currently sends on-road traffic officers to an average of 80 incidents a day across the region since the secretary of state for transport , alistair darling , launched the service in the region last december .
devon and cornwall police said it was a positive move which would help them .
insp richard pryce said : " we are geographically the largest force in the country with an extensive road network that is put under added pressure by an influx of visitors in the summer .
" although we still have overall responsibility for road policing , the highways agency traffic officers will concentrate on non-law enforcement road issues , allowing us to make the best possible use of our resources . "
