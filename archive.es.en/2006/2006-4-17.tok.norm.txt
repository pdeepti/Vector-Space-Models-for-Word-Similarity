dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .
i do n't think about standing out myself or being more or less the best .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : soccer as a business world cup scores goal for german economy world cup commercialization slurs put fifa on defensive revenues rise for retailers and breweries during world cup bayern munich under the christmas tree business -pipe- 17.04.2006 adidas cashes in on the world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas is on the ball when it comes to making money from sports german sports giant adidas is using its dominance in the soccer gear business during the upcoming world cup to kit out the german national team as well as five others .
and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .
brüggen said the sports equipment-maker was gunning for a turnover of over a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- with soccer products alone in the year 2006 . until now , revenue in that sector has been around 900 million euros .
but adidas reached a turnover of more than six billion euros last year with its sports equipment and fashion line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer image of the planned adidas world of football in berlin during the world cup , adidas ' link with soccer will extend beyond the ritual kitting out of the teams .
this time the sports giant will also sponsor a world cup arena - a miniature version of berlin 's olympia stadium - which will hold up to 10,000 people and is being built on a prime site between the german parliament and the chancellery in the capital .

and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .
brüggen said the sports equipment-maker was gunning for a turnover of over a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- with soccer products alone in the year 2006 . until now , revenue in that sector has been around 900 million euros .
but adidas reached a turnover of more than six billion euros last year with its sports equipment and fashion line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer image of the planned adidas world of football in berlin during the world cup , adidas ' link with soccer will extend beyond the ritual kitting out of the teams .
this time the sports giant will also sponsor a world cup arena - a miniature version of berlin 's olympia stadium - which will hold up to 10,000 people and is being built on a prime site between the german parliament and the chancellery in the capital . " we 're not just going to broadcast all the games live to create an authentic stadium experience , but we 're also planning to stage concerts there with james blunt and the black eyed peas , for instance , " said brüggen . the provisional stadium will be surrounded by amateur soccer pitches , restaurants and - naturally - adidas shops .
the savvy marketing campaign will cost adidas some 20 million euros . milking the world cup well in time thus thee company 's marketing strategists have already ensured that business is booming even before the world cup kicks off . " when the first ball rolls on the field on june 9 , we 're going to say : the world cup was successful for adidas , " said brüggen . karl zawadzky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de herzogenaurach : more than adidas and puma the northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach is probably best known as the headquarter of sports brands adidas and puma , but there 's much more to explore .
-lrb- march 4 , 2006 -rrb- soccer ball stitchers face a tough game the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made .
-lrb- feb .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .

and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .
brüggen said the sports equipment-maker was gunning for a turnover of over a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- with soccer products alone in the year 2006 . until now , revenue in that sector has been around 900 million euros .
but adidas reached a turnover of more than six billion euros last year with its sports equipment and fashion line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer image of the planned adidas world of football in berlin during the world cup , adidas ' link with soccer will extend beyond the ritual kitting out of the teams .
this time the sports giant will also sponsor a world cup arena - a miniature version of berlin 's olympia stadium - which will hold up to 10,000 people and is being built on a prime site between the german parliament and the chancellery in the capital . " we 're not just going to broadcast all the games live to create an authentic stadium experience , but we 're also planning to stage concerts there with james blunt and the black eyed peas , for instance , " said brüggen . the provisional stadium will be surrounded by amateur soccer pitches , restaurants and - naturally - adidas shops .
the savvy marketing campaign will cost adidas some 20 million euros . milking the world cup well in time thus thee company 's marketing strategists have already ensured that business is booming even before the world cup kicks off . " when the first ball rolls on the field on june 9 , we 're going to say : the world cup was successful for adidas , " said brüggen . karl zawadzky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de herzogenaurach : more than adidas and puma the northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach is probably best known as the headquarter of sports brands adidas and puma , but there 's much more to explore .

" iran continues to make a maximum effort so that no war will happen in this region , " ansari said .
but he added that " iran has been , is and will be prepared " for armed conflict if it comes to that .

iran denies this accusation and insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy . responding to a question on tuesday 's meeting in moscow , ansari said : " we are expecting these six states will give back the iaea 's authority and prestige so that we can cooperate with this agency as we did before . " " iran is interested in good-faith cooperation with the iaea and iran is trying to ensure that this cooperation is open and transparent so that no more questions remain " about the country 's nuclear program , the ambassador was quoted as saying . he added however that iran intended to continue developing its nuclear power program in line with iaea guidelines . " we are working actively with the iaea and we want to maintain this relationship , " ansari said , according to itar-tass news agency .
" we will maintain all of our activities in the nuclear area in the framework of the agency 's directives , criteria and regulations , " the agency quoted him as saying . use of high-tech centrifuges sparks concern meanwhile ali larijani , the head of the supreme national security council , iran 's top nuclear official vowed on monday that the clerical regime would press on with uranium enrichment work despite mounting international pressure to freeze its sensitive nuclear activities .

larijani , was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad 's comments on p-2 centrifuges have stoked fears in the west larijani has also implicitly confirmed comments by hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad that iran was working on using advanced p-2 centrifuges - devices that can enrich at a much faster rate than the p-1 technology iran is presently using . when asked about the new work , larijani replied that iran " will continue research work within the framework " of the iaea . according to the new york times , ahmadinejad 's revelation of the p-2 work has provoked such surprise and concern among international nuclear inspectors that they are planning to confront tehran about it this week .
inspectors had long suspected that iran had been working on the p-2 centrifuge design - bought on the black market from the renegade pakistani nuclear engineer abdul qadeer khan - separately from the activity at its main nuclear facility at natanz . european diplomats said a delegation of iranian officials is due to arrive on tuesday in vienna , where the iaea will press them to address the new enrichment claim , as well as other questions about iran 's program , including a crude bomb design found in the country , the us daily said . if iran moved beyond research and actually began running the machines , it could force american intelligence agencies to revise their estimates of how long it would take for iran to build an atom bomb - an event they now put somewhere between 2010 and 2015 , according to the report . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

iran denies this accusation and insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy . responding to a question on tuesday 's meeting in moscow , ansari said : " we are expecting these six states will give back the iaea 's authority and prestige so that we can cooperate with this agency as we did before . " " iran is interested in good-faith cooperation with the iaea and iran is trying to ensure that this cooperation is open and transparent so that no more questions remain " about the country 's nuclear program , the ambassador was quoted as saying . he added however that iran intended to continue developing its nuclear power program in line with iaea guidelines . " we are working actively with the iaea and we want to maintain this relationship , " ansari said , according to itar-tass news agency .
" we will maintain all of our activities in the nuclear area in the framework of the agency 's directives , criteria and regulations , " the agency quoted him as saying . use of high-tech centrifuges sparks concern meanwhile ali larijani , the head of the supreme national security council , iran 's top nuclear official vowed on monday that the clerical regime would press on with uranium enrichment work despite mounting international pressure to freeze its sensitive nuclear activities . " why should iran suspend its research activities ? "
larijani , was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad 's comments on p-2 centrifuges have stoked fears in the west larijani has also implicitly confirmed comments by hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad that iran was working on using advanced p-2 centrifuges - devices that can enrich at a much faster rate than the p-1 technology iran is presently using . when asked about the new work , larijani replied that iran " will continue research work within the framework " of the iaea . according to the new york times , ahmadinejad 's revelation of the p-2 work has provoked such surprise and concern among international nuclear inspectors that they are planning to confront tehran about it this week .
inspectors had long suspected that iran had been working on the p-2 centrifuge design - bought on the black market from the renegade pakistani nuclear engineer abdul qadeer khan - separately from the activity at its main nuclear facility at natanz . european diplomats said a delegation of iranian officials is due to arrive on tuesday in vienna , where the iaea will press them to address the new enrichment claim , as well as other questions about iran 's program , including a crude bomb design found in the country , the us daily said . if iran moved beyond research and actually began running the machines , it could force american intelligence agencies to revise their estimates of how long it would take for iran to build an atom bomb - an event they now put somewhere between 2010 and 2015 , according to the report . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

" one way to avert war is to be prepared for any war , " iranian ambassador gholamreza ansari was quoted by russian news agencies as saying on the eve of talks in moscow among six powers on how to address the iran nuclear problem . " iran continues to make a maximum effort so that no war will happen in this region , " ansari said .
but he added that " iran has been , is and will be prepared " for armed conflict if it comes to that .
" we hope that the iranian issue will be resolved by way of negotiation , " interfax and ria novosti quoted him as saying . fears that iran could make bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed concerns over iran 's stance his comments came as officials representing the five permanent un security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany prepared to hold talks in moscow on how to proceed on the iran nuclear issue . the united states has said punitive measures such as freezing iranian assets or imposing travel restrictions on senior officials will be on the agenda of the meeting . the security council on march 29 gave iran 30 days to suspend uranium enrichment activities .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , visited iran last week and was due to report back to the security council before april 29 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice has talked of a security council resolution which could sanction force against iran the united states has accused iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear energy program .
last tuesday , iran announced it had successfully enriched uranium to the level needed for reactor fuel , reigniting fears that the hardline regime would soon acquire the technical know-how to make bombs .
iran denies this accusation and insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy . responding to a question on tuesday 's meeting in moscow , ansari said : " we are expecting these six states will give back the iaea 's authority and prestige so that we can cooperate with this agency as we did before . " " iran is interested in good-faith cooperation with the iaea and iran is trying to ensure that this cooperation is open and transparent so that no more questions remain " about the country 's nuclear program , the ambassador was quoted as saying . he added however that iran intended to continue developing its nuclear power program in line with iaea guidelines . " we are working actively with the iaea and we want to maintain this relationship , " ansari said , according to itar-tass news agency .
" we will maintain all of our activities in the nuclear area in the framework of the agency 's directives , criteria and regulations , " the agency quoted him as saying . use of high-tech centrifuges sparks concern meanwhile ali larijani , the head of the supreme national security council , iran 's top nuclear official vowed on monday that the clerical regime would press on with uranium enrichment work despite mounting international pressure to freeze its sensitive nuclear activities .

larijani , was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad 's comments on p-2 centrifuges have stoked fears in the west larijani has also implicitly confirmed comments by hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad that iran was working on using advanced p-2 centrifuges - devices that can enrich at a much faster rate than the p-1 technology iran is presently using . when asked about the new work , larijani replied that iran " will continue research work within the framework " of the iaea . according to the new york times , ahmadinejad 's revelation of the p-2 work has provoked such surprise and concern among international nuclear inspectors that they are planning to confront tehran about it this week .
inspectors had long suspected that iran had been working on the p-2 centrifuge design - bought on the black market from the renegade pakistani nuclear engineer abdul qadeer khan - separately from the activity at its main nuclear facility at natanz . european diplomats said a delegation of iranian officials is due to arrive on tuesday in vienna , where the iaea will press them to address the new enrichment claim , as well as other questions about iran 's program , including a crude bomb design found in the country , the us daily said . if iran moved beyond research and actually began running the machines , it could force american intelligence agencies to revise their estimates of how long it would take for iran to build an atom bomb - an event they now put somewhere between 2010 and 2015 , according to the report . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .

but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .

we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .

recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .

" shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .

" if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

" one way to avert war is to be prepared for any war , " iranian ambassador gholamreza ansari was quoted by russian news agencies as saying on the eve of talks in moscow among six powers on how to address the iran nuclear problem . " iran continues to make a maximum effort so that no war will happen in this region , " ansari said .
but he added that " iran has been , is and will be prepared " for armed conflict if it comes to that .
" we hope that the iranian issue will be resolved by way of negotiation , " interfax and ria novosti quoted him as saying . fears that iran could make bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed concerns over iran 's stance his comments came as officials representing the five permanent un security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany prepared to hold talks in moscow on how to proceed on the iran nuclear issue . the united states has said punitive measures such as freezing iranian assets or imposing travel restrictions on senior officials will be on the agenda of the meeting . the security council on march 29 gave iran 30 days to suspend uranium enrichment activities .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , visited iran last week and was due to report back to the security council before april 29 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice has talked of a security council resolution which could sanction force against iran the united states has accused iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear energy program .
last tuesday , iran announced it had successfully enriched uranium to the level needed for reactor fuel , reigniting fears that the hardline regime would soon acquire the technical know-how to make bombs .
iran denies this accusation and insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy . responding to a question on tuesday 's meeting in moscow , ansari said : " we are expecting these six states will give back the iaea 's authority and prestige so that we can cooperate with this agency as we did before . " " iran is interested in good-faith cooperation with the iaea and iran is trying to ensure that this cooperation is open and transparent so that no more questions remain " about the country 's nuclear program , the ambassador was quoted as saying . he added however that iran intended to continue developing its nuclear power program in line with iaea guidelines . " we are working actively with the iaea and we want to maintain this relationship , " ansari said , according to itar-tass news agency .
" we will maintain all of our activities in the nuclear area in the framework of the agency 's directives , criteria and regulations , " the agency quoted him as saying . use of high-tech centrifuges sparks concern meanwhile ali larijani , the head of the supreme national security council , iran 's top nuclear official vowed on monday that the clerical regime would press on with uranium enrichment work despite mounting international pressure to freeze its sensitive nuclear activities . " why should iran suspend its research activities ? "
larijani , was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad 's comments on p-2 centrifuges have stoked fears in the west larijani has also implicitly confirmed comments by hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad that iran was working on using advanced p-2 centrifuges - devices that can enrich at a much faster rate than the p-1 technology iran is presently using . when asked about the new work , larijani replied that iran " will continue research work within the framework " of the iaea . according to the new york times , ahmadinejad 's revelation of the p-2 work has provoked such surprise and concern among international nuclear inspectors that they are planning to confront tehran about it this week .
inspectors had long suspected that iran had been working on the p-2 centrifuge design - bought on the black market from the renegade pakistani nuclear engineer abdul qadeer khan - separately from the activity at its main nuclear facility at natanz . european diplomats said a delegation of iranian officials is due to arrive on tuesday in vienna , where the iaea will press them to address the new enrichment claim , as well as other questions about iran 's program , including a crude bomb design found in the country , the us daily said . if iran moved beyond research and actually began running the machines , it could force american intelligence agencies to revise their estimates of how long it would take for iran to build an atom bomb - an event they now put somewhere between 2010 and 2015 , according to the report . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .
brüggen said the sports equipment-maker was gunning for a turnover of over a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- with soccer products alone in the year 2006 . until now , revenue in that sector has been around 900 million euros .
but adidas reached a turnover of more than six billion euros last year with its sports equipment and fashion line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer image of the planned adidas world of football in berlin during the world cup , adidas ' link with soccer will extend beyond the ritual kitting out of the teams .
this time the sports giant will also sponsor a world cup arena - a miniature version of berlin 's olympia stadium - which will hold up to 10,000 people and is being built on a prime site between the german parliament and the chancellery in the capital . " we 're not just going to broadcast all the games live to create an authentic stadium experience , but we 're also planning to stage concerts there with james blunt and the black eyed peas , for instance , " said brüggen . the provisional stadium will be surrounded by amateur soccer pitches , restaurants and - naturally - adidas shops .
the savvy marketing campaign will cost adidas some 20 million euros . milking the world cup well in time thus thee company 's marketing strategists have already ensured that business is booming even before the world cup kicks off . " when the first ball rolls on the field on june 9 , we 're going to say : the world cup was successful for adidas , " said brüggen . karl zawadzky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de herzogenaurach : more than adidas and puma the northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach is probably best known as the headquarter of sports brands adidas and puma , but there 's much more to explore .

it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2006 integration debate rages in wake of honor killing conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society runs the risk of becoming even more divided the so-called honor killing of 23-year-old hatan sürücü by her brother ayhan and his subsequent trial and conviction have plunged germany further into a volatile debate regarding the integration of muslim immigrants . the case has sparked outrage and led politicians and community leaders demanding clearer and more effective integration rules for those who flout german laws and continue practices such as forced marriage and honor killings in germany . hatan was shot several times in the head at point-blank range by her youngest brother , who said at the start of his trial that he committed the crime because his sister had brought shame upon his family by adopting a western lifestyle .
hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .
integration experts have urged her to directly address the immigrant population in a televised speech , underlined with turkish subtitles , or to cooperate with the large turkish daily hurriyet , which is widely read among germany 's turkish population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a murder becomes political the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .

heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .

it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .

that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .

when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .

we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .

is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .

" one way to avert war is to be prepared for any war , " iranian ambassador gholamreza ansari was quoted by russian news agencies as saying on the eve of talks in moscow among six powers on how to address the iran nuclear problem . " iran continues to make a maximum effort so that no war will happen in this region , " ansari said .
but he added that " iran has been , is and will be prepared " for armed conflict if it comes to that .
" we hope that the iranian issue will be resolved by way of negotiation , " interfax and ria novosti quoted him as saying . fears that iran could make bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed concerns over iran 's stance his comments came as officials representing the five permanent un security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany prepared to hold talks in moscow on how to proceed on the iran nuclear issue . the united states has said punitive measures such as freezing iranian assets or imposing travel restrictions on senior officials will be on the agenda of the meeting . the security council on march 29 gave iran 30 days to suspend uranium enrichment activities .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , visited iran last week and was due to report back to the security council before april 29 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice has talked of a security council resolution which could sanction force against iran the united states has accused iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear energy program .
last tuesday , iran announced it had successfully enriched uranium to the level needed for reactor fuel , reigniting fears that the hardline regime would soon acquire the technical know-how to make bombs .
iran denies this accusation and insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy . responding to a question on tuesday 's meeting in moscow , ansari said : " we are expecting these six states will give back the iaea 's authority and prestige so that we can cooperate with this agency as we did before . " " iran is interested in good-faith cooperation with the iaea and iran is trying to ensure that this cooperation is open and transparent so that no more questions remain " about the country 's nuclear program , the ambassador was quoted as saying . he added however that iran intended to continue developing its nuclear power program in line with iaea guidelines . " we are working actively with the iaea and we want to maintain this relationship , " ansari said , according to itar-tass news agency .
" we will maintain all of our activities in the nuclear area in the framework of the agency 's directives , criteria and regulations , " the agency quoted him as saying . use of high-tech centrifuges sparks concern meanwhile ali larijani , the head of the supreme national security council , iran 's top nuclear official vowed on monday that the clerical regime would press on with uranium enrichment work despite mounting international pressure to freeze its sensitive nuclear activities . " why should iran suspend its research activities ? "
larijani , was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad 's comments on p-2 centrifuges have stoked fears in the west larijani has also implicitly confirmed comments by hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad that iran was working on using advanced p-2 centrifuges - devices that can enrich at a much faster rate than the p-1 technology iran is presently using . when asked about the new work , larijani replied that iran " will continue research work within the framework " of the iaea . according to the new york times , ahmadinejad 's revelation of the p-2 work has provoked such surprise and concern among international nuclear inspectors that they are planning to confront tehran about it this week .
inspectors had long suspected that iran had been working on the p-2 centrifuge design - bought on the black market from the renegade pakistani nuclear engineer abdul qadeer khan - separately from the activity at its main nuclear facility at natanz . european diplomats said a delegation of iranian officials is due to arrive on tuesday in vienna , where the iaea will press them to address the new enrichment claim , as well as other questions about iran 's program , including a crude bomb design found in the country , the us daily said . if iran moved beyond research and actually began running the machines , it could force american intelligence agencies to revise their estimates of how long it would take for iran to build an atom bomb - an event they now put somewhere between 2010 and 2015 , according to the report . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .
integration experts have urged her to directly address the immigrant population in a televised speech , underlined with turkish subtitles , or to cooperate with the large turkish daily hurriyet , which is widely read among germany 's turkish population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a murder becomes political the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .

" iran continues to make a maximum effort so that no war will happen in this region , " ansari said .
but he added that " iran has been , is and will be prepared " for armed conflict if it comes to that .
" we hope that the iranian issue will be resolved by way of negotiation , " interfax and ria novosti quoted him as saying . fears that iran could make bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has expressed concerns over iran 's stance his comments came as officials representing the five permanent un security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany prepared to hold talks in moscow on how to proceed on the iran nuclear issue . the united states has said punitive measures such as freezing iranian assets or imposing travel restrictions on senior officials will be on the agenda of the meeting . the security council on march 29 gave iran 30 days to suspend uranium enrichment activities .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , visited iran last week and was due to report back to the security council before april 29 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice has talked of a security council resolution which could sanction force against iran the united states has accused iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear energy program .
last tuesday , iran announced it had successfully enriched uranium to the level needed for reactor fuel , reigniting fears that the hardline regime would soon acquire the technical know-how to make bombs .
iran denies this accusation and insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy . responding to a question on tuesday 's meeting in moscow , ansari said : " we are expecting these six states will give back the iaea 's authority and prestige so that we can cooperate with this agency as we did before . " " iran is interested in good-faith cooperation with the iaea and iran is trying to ensure that this cooperation is open and transparent so that no more questions remain " about the country 's nuclear program , the ambassador was quoted as saying . he added however that iran intended to continue developing its nuclear power program in line with iaea guidelines . " we are working actively with the iaea and we want to maintain this relationship , " ansari said , according to itar-tass news agency .
" we will maintain all of our activities in the nuclear area in the framework of the agency 's directives , criteria and regulations , " the agency quoted him as saying . use of high-tech centrifuges sparks concern meanwhile ali larijani , the head of the supreme national security council , iran 's top nuclear official vowed on monday that the clerical regime would press on with uranium enrichment work despite mounting international pressure to freeze its sensitive nuclear activities . " why should iran suspend its research activities ? "
larijani , was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad 's comments on p-2 centrifuges have stoked fears in the west larijani has also implicitly confirmed comments by hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad that iran was working on using advanced p-2 centrifuges - devices that can enrich at a much faster rate than the p-1 technology iran is presently using . when asked about the new work , larijani replied that iran " will continue research work within the framework " of the iaea . according to the new york times , ahmadinejad 's revelation of the p-2 work has provoked such surprise and concern among international nuclear inspectors that they are planning to confront tehran about it this week .
inspectors had long suspected that iran had been working on the p-2 centrifuge design - bought on the black market from the renegade pakistani nuclear engineer abdul qadeer khan - separately from the activity at its main nuclear facility at natanz . european diplomats said a delegation of iranian officials is due to arrive on tuesday in vienna , where the iaea will press them to address the new enrichment claim , as well as other questions about iran 's program , including a crude bomb design found in the country , the us daily said . if iran moved beyond research and actually began running the machines , it could force american intelligence agencies to revise their estimates of how long it would take for iran to build an atom bomb - an event they now put somewhere between 2010 and 2015 , according to the report . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un calls to freeze nuclear program un atomic agency chief , mohamed elbaradei , is in tehran for talks with iran 's top nuclear negotiator .

at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .

which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .

you never know what will happen .

the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .

" shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society .

" if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .

and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .

the savvy marketing campaign will cost adidas some 20 million euros . milking the world cup well in time thus thee company 's marketing strategists have already ensured that business is booming even before the world cup kicks off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2006 integration debate rages in wake of honor killing conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society runs the risk of becoming even more divided the so-called honor killing of 23-year-old hatan sürücü by her brother ayhan and his subsequent trial and conviction have plunged germany further into a volatile debate regarding the integration of muslim immigrants . the case has sparked outrage and led politicians and community leaders demanding clearer and more effective integration rules for those who flout german laws and continue practices such as forced marriage and honor killings in germany . hatan was shot several times in the head at point-blank range by her youngest brother , who said at the start of his trial that he committed the crime because his sister had brought shame upon his family by adopting a western lifestyle .
hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .
integration experts have urged her to directly address the immigrant population in a televised speech , underlined with turkish subtitles , or to cooperate with the large turkish daily hurriyet , which is widely read among germany 's turkish population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a murder becomes political the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .
integration experts have urged her to directly address the immigrant population in a televised speech , underlined with turkish subtitles , or to cooperate with the large turkish daily hurriyet , which is widely read among germany 's turkish population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a murder becomes political the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2006 integration debate rages in wake of honor killing conviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german society runs the risk of becoming even more divided the so-called honor killing of 23-year-old hatan sürücü by her brother ayhan and his subsequent trial and conviction have plunged germany further into a volatile debate regarding the integration of muslim immigrants . the case has sparked outrage and led politicians and community leaders demanding clearer and more effective integration rules for those who flout german laws and continue practices such as forced marriage and honor killings in germany . hatan was shot several times in the head at point-blank range by her youngest brother , who said at the start of his trial that he committed the crime because his sister had brought shame upon his family by adopting a western lifestyle .
hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .
integration experts have urged her to directly address the immigrant population in a televised speech , underlined with turkish subtitles , or to cooperate with the large turkish daily hurriyet , which is widely read among germany 's turkish population . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a murder becomes political the brother of hatun sürücü has been sentenced to jail for murdering his sister because he disapproved of her lifestyle .

and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .
brüggen said the sports equipment-maker was gunning for a turnover of over a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- with soccer products alone in the year 2006 . until now , revenue in that sector has been around 900 million euros .
but adidas reached a turnover of more than six billion euros last year with its sports equipment and fashion line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer image of the planned adidas world of football in berlin during the world cup , adidas ' link with soccer will extend beyond the ritual kitting out of the teams .
this time the sports giant will also sponsor a world cup arena - a miniature version of berlin 's olympia stadium - which will hold up to 10,000 people and is being built on a prime site between the german parliament and the chancellery in the capital . " we 're not just going to broadcast all the games live to create an authentic stadium experience , but we 're also planning to stage concerts there with james blunt and the black eyed peas , for instance , " said brüggen . the provisional stadium will be surrounded by amateur soccer pitches , restaurants and - naturally - adidas shops .
the savvy marketing campaign will cost adidas some 20 million euros . milking the world cup well in time thus thee company 's marketing strategists have already ensured that business is booming even before the world cup kicks off . " when the first ball rolls on the field on june 9 , we 're going to say : the world cup was successful for adidas , " said brüggen . karl zawadzky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de herzogenaurach : more than adidas and puma the northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach is probably best known as the headquarter of sports brands adidas and puma , but there 's much more to explore .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .
we hear and see so much about it that it 's impossible not to think about it . what are your expectations from the world cup in germany in general ? since i have already played in one world cup , i 'm familiar with the dimensions .
regarding the organization , i believe it will be well organized .
i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .
all people are equal , regardless of skin color , race or whatever .
everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .
will the 2006 world cup be ronaldinho 's ? i think that it will be brazil 's world cup .

dw-world.de spoke with the two-time world footballer of the year about the world cup , family and racism . unlike any other player in the world , brazilian and barcelona superstar ronaldinho can dominate a soccer match .
at the age of 22 , he was on the brazil squad that captured a record fifth world cup title .
heading into this summer 's tournament , the selecao is again the odds on favorite , and the hopes of 170 million brazilians will be riding on the midfield mastery of 26-year-old ronaldinho . dw-world : germany and brazil have already been overcome with world cup fever .
do you have it too ? ronaldinho : i think the whole world has it .
everyone is already excited .
i already have world cup fever .

i saw that last summer at the confederations cup , which was a kind of preview of the world cup . brazil 's national coach carlos alberto parreira believes that every country will be fighting against brazil , since the selecao is considered the favorite .
which teams do you think will be the most difficult at the world cup ? i think that all the games will be difficult , from the beginning to the end .
it will be hard to advance past the first stage , because everyone will be aiming for us .
they will all have a bit of extra motivation .
i think that every opponent has to be paid attention to equally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates with roberto carlos -lrb- l -rrb- and adriano in the qualifier against venezuela which of your three group opponents - croatia , australia , and japan - will provide the most serious challenge ? all three must be taken seriously and deserve our respect . will germany have a chance at getting revenge against brazil for the final loss in 2002 ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- it 's possible .
you never know what will happen .
but i am not so worried about whom we play .
the most important thing is that brazil reaches the final and wins .
that is our goal .
i am not concentrating so much on our opponent , but on our own team . what has changed between the 2002 squad and the current one , other than the coach and a few players ? the motivation is different .
those who won in 2002 know how good it is to win a world cup and are very motivated .
those who have n't played in a world cup have heard the whole time how great it is to win one .
when these two groups come together , the experienced along with the young players , then i think that is the difference in comparison to 2002 . what do you think about the criticism your teammate ronaldo has received lately ? i think that a player at his level , a player who fills his role every weekend , deserves a little more respect and a little more peace .
but this is good for us brazilians .
it gives us more motivation at the cup .
and i think he will be one of the big names this summer . you were named the world 's best soccer player in each of the past two years .
recently you said that the ball was your " girlfriend " and that nothing in the world makes you happier than playing soccer .
is it really true that nothing makes you happier ?
what is it like , for example , when you lose ? that is frustrating .
you practice all week , you give it your all and sometimes it 's still not enough .
i have always said that the ball is my girlfriend .
as long as i play soccer , it will stay that way .
there are also other wonderful things in my life .
everything has great importance in its time in my life .
but when i have the ball , it 's my girlfriend , and i treat her accordingly - with gentleness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a cardboard ronaldinho -lrb- l -rrb- is popular in barcelona barcelona fans say that you have brought magic back into the stadium .
how did this close relationship with the fans come about ? i simply feel at home here .
i play soccer here like i would in my own backyard with my whole family watching .
my family consists of 100,000 people .
there is nothing better than to feel loved by 100,000 spectators and to make them happy every match .
nothing is missing here .
i do what i love to do most .
and i make very many people happy doing it . but there are also many ugly moments in soccer .
during a game at zaragoza , your teammate samuel eto 'o threatened to leave the pitch because of racial epithets being chanted at him .
what do you think of the problem of racism in soccer ? that is a bad thing .
we are always trying to get the point across that that is n't the right way .
we hope that the problem comes to an end as soon as possible .
what happened to eto 'o made us very sad in barcelona .
the right thing is that fans go to the stadium to have fun , to support their club and to leave the stadium happy .

everyone does their best to make lots of people happy . at the age of 26 , you have probably achieved everything a soccer player dreams of .
you are a world cup champion , play in the largest soccer club in the world and have been chosen best soccer player of the year the past two years .
do you attribute your success to work , destiny or luck ? a little bit of everything .
you have to have a little bit of luck , work hard , and i think , when the man up above says that will happen , then it will .
when he says that it will happen , and you put your biggest effort into it , then it will be enough to work and the things will then happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo 's eight goals carried brazil to the world cup title in 2002 the 2002 world cup was ronaldo 's .

bayern munich were jeered by fans after the first-half before scoring twice to dispose of bielefeld .
hamburg stayed on the leaders ' heels with a 2-0 victory at duisburg . michael ballack has been labeled a mercenary for negotiating a free transfer to english champions chelsea but he showed his loyalty still lies with bayern munich , scoring a vital opening goal in their 2-0 win over arminia bielefeld on saturday .
it was ballack 's 13th league goal of the season , and it means bayern need just eight points from the final four matches to retain their german title .
" every goal is nice and i would not say this one was special , " said ballack .

hatan had returned to germany pregnant after fleeing from a forced marriage in turkey . last week , ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months for the murder of his sister , close to the 10-year maximum allowable .
though his two older brothers were implicated in assisting ayhan in killing hatan , their involvement could not be proved .
both were acquitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatun sürücü the murder caused revulsion in germany and has contributed to a surge of strong emotions in the simmering debate over how to deal with a conservative muslim immigrant community at odds with mainstream german society . the parliamentary group of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have demanded a policy of " no tolerance " for such murders , calling them " a shameful form of self-administered justice . " the killing and other high profile incidents have increased concerns that germany 's large immigrant community - many out of work , poorly educated and without german citizenship - may be becoming more isolated from the rest of the country . talk of integration initiatives replaced with deportation politicians from across the german political spectrum have made proposals to help solve the problems , including compulsory language training for immigrants and tests to ensure they share german society 's basic social and cultural values .
some conservatives , who claim that lax " multicultural " policies have encouraged authorities to turn a blind eye to abuses , have said that immigrants guilty of serious breaches of german law should be deported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosbach led the calls for the sürücü family to be deported wolfgang bosbach , cdu / csu parliamentary group leader , said the sürücü family should be forced to leave .
he called on the foreign ministry " to expel the involved parties in this deliberately and cold-blooded planned murder . " shortly after the ayhan sürücü was sentenced , berlin 's senator for the interior , social democrat ehrhart körting , and prominent berlin cdu politician friedbert pflüger suggested the family voluntarily leave the country . cardinal calls for more effort from both sides but cardinal karl lehmann , the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , rejected calls for the expulsion of foreigners who prove unwilling to integrate in german society . " i 'm not one of those publicly calling for expulsions and other tough measures against foreigners , " cardinal lehmann said .
" this can only be an act of political desperation .
there may be individual cases where such a step is needed but it can never be a wholesale political means to get to grips with the problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for more dialogue however , the cardinal said that respect for german laws and traditions should be a precondition for foreigners to be allowed to live in germany and that the authorities should never tolerate so-called parallel societies , which are governed by their own rules and traditions , being established in germany . " if foreigners do n't accept our society and continue to live by their own rules then they must be made to understand that they wo n't have a place in german society .
we must n't tolerate practices such as arranged marriages or so-called honor killings . " politicians urged to accept more responsibility for problems while the unwillingness of some immigrants to integrate or adhere to the laws of their adopted land is certainly a major problem , many experts and critics believe that successive governments have exacerbated the situation by acting as though foreigners would one day return home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few politicians expected so many guest workers to stay politicians of all parties who have come in and out of power since millions of guest workers entered the country in the 1960s and 70s have been accused of failing to draw up a plan to deal with the eventuality that most would remain . in an attempt to diffuse the escalating tensions , chancellor merkel has called for an integration summit which will summon some of germany 's muslim leaders .

and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends . adidas ' involvement with soccer dates back to the legendary 1954 world cup when the german national team jogged out on the pitch with soccer shoes sporting the characteristic three-stripe logo .
adidas founder adolf dassler is said to have personally screwed on the spikes under the shoes for captain fritz walter and his team , who went on to beat hungary and clinch germany 's first world cup title . ever since that memorable victory , the sports equipment maker from the town of herzogenaurach has been the german national soccer team 's partner and now also that of world soccer body fifa as well as of european soccer association uefa . sponsoring " team spirit " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas ' new adornment for the german national team the world cup in june will be no different : in addition to the german team , five other national teams will be running around in adidas shoes and t-shirts .
the sports giant will also outfit all the referees , linesmen , assistants and hostesses at the event .
even the official ball , called " teamgeist , " or " team spirit , " is an adidas product . after all , team spirit is the most essential quality a squad should have to become world champion , said adidas spokesman oliver brüggen .
a total of 2,650 balls will be produced exclusively for the 64 world cup games . adidas made in asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an adidas factory in suzhou , china the german sports heavyweight closed all its home factories over a decade ago and has now completely moved production to low-cost asian countries , such as china , india , indonesia , vietnam , thailand and south korea . the same goes for the world cup ball .
though " teamgeist " was conceived in germany , its valve and rubber pump come from india , the inner cotton sheath from vietnam , the artificial leather is made in south korea , and the rubber sticker is produced in thailand .
the ball , which will be assembled in thailand by a japanese company , will be marketed and distributed all over the world . advertising juggernaut adidas plans to sell more than 10 million " teamgeist " balls worldwide .
at the last world cup , it sold six million balls . in addition , the massive merchandising drive will pump out around one and a half million t-shirts such as those that the national teams will wear at the world cup and sell nearly 300,000 jackets , pants and bags with the adidas ' stripes . the advertising juggernaut underlines the fact that soccer is n't just a game for adidas , but big business .
brüggen said the sports equipment-maker was gunning for a turnover of over a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- with soccer products alone in the year 2006 . until now , revenue in that sector has been around 900 million euros .
but adidas reached a turnover of more than six billion euros last year with its sports equipment and fashion line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer image of the planned adidas world of football in berlin during the world cup , adidas ' link with soccer will extend beyond the ritual kitting out of the teams .
this time the sports giant will also sponsor a world cup arena - a miniature version of berlin 's olympia stadium - which will hold up to 10,000 people and is being built on a prime site between the german parliament and the chancellery in the capital . " we 're not just going to broadcast all the games live to create an authentic stadium experience , but we 're also planning to stage concerts there with james blunt and the black eyed peas , for instance , " said brüggen . the provisional stadium will be surrounded by amateur soccer pitches , restaurants and - naturally - adidas shops .
the savvy marketing campaign will cost adidas some 20 million euros . milking the world cup well in time thus thee company 's marketing strategists have already ensured that business is booming even before the world cup kicks off . " when the first ball rolls on the field on june 9 , we 're going to say : the world cup was successful for adidas , " said brüggen . karl zawadzky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de herzogenaurach : more than adidas and puma the northern bavarian town of herzogenaurach is probably best known as the headquarter of sports brands adidas and puma , but there 's much more to explore .
-lrb- march 4 , 2006 -rrb- soccer ball stitchers face a tough game the upcoming world cup has increased the popularity of soccer balls .
it 's also the ideal opportunity to draw attention to the conditions in which they are made .
-lrb- feb .
14 , 2006 -rrb- soccer coming back to the reichstag the world cup soccer final in berlin will certainly be the hottest ticket in town this summer .
now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event .

middle class malaysia relies heavily on domestic workers - 300,000 from indonesia alone .
but they are excluded from much of malaysia 's employment legislation and so enjoy only limited protection .
human rights watch and a coalition of regional workers ' groups want the two countries to change that .
typically , live-in maids earn just over $ 100 a month and many are lucky to get any time off at all .
campaigners say they should have a minimum wage and one rest day per week .
they also want workers to be able to keep their passports rather than hand them over to their employers , and they are asking for proper procedures to help maids who are abused .
shocking case a malaysian court is currently trying a local couple for allegedly torturing an indonesian maid with an iron .
last week the court heard that nirmala bonat was required to clean the iron of her own burnt flesh and skin .
the case shocked malaysia and provoked outrage in indonesia .
however the indonesian authorities have been accused by rights groups of doing far less to protect their workers abroad that the neighbouring philippines , where expatriate workers are a powerful lobby .

ajay gupta , who heads the indian labs of hewlett packard , said it was a myth that indians wanted cheap goods .
during a visit to the computer giant 's uk headquarters , he urged companies hoping to boost computer use in india to offer innovative solutions and value .
mr gupta 's comments came two weeks after chip maker intel announced a computer specifically for the indian market .
the intel community pc is built to withstand the dust and humidity of many parts of india as well as the sometimes erratic power supply that can damage standard computers .
it will runs on open-source software and has several ways of connecting to the internet , including wireless and the mobile phone standard , gsm .
it will be manufactured in india by computer makers , wipro , esys and hcl and will cost from £ 230 -lrb- $ 400 -rrb- .
intel hopes that the machine will help rural indians gain a level footing with their urban counterparts and allow pcs to be used in areas where it was previously impossible .

for example , there is only one pc owner for every four people with a television , he says , despite some colour sets costing much more than a low-spec computer .
" today , a television in india costs about £ 200 -lrb- $ 350 -rrb- and you can get a pc for about £ 150 -lrb- $ 263 -rrb- , " said mr gupta .
" but people know what to do with a television and not with a pc . "
in india 's increasingly affluent society , one of the main stumbling blocks is language .
many people are put off using computers because of the difficulty of using standard qwerty-style keyboards with indic languages , of which there are more than 18 .
hindi has 36 consonants that can be modified to make 1,500 separate syllables .
typing in just one may take two or three key strokes on a keyboard originally designed for the english language .
pen gestures hewlett packard is hoping to change this with a new keyboard designed to bridge the divide .
the $ 100 laptop was launched in tunis last year the gesture keyboard -lrb- gsk -rrb- , developed at the company 's bangalore research laboratories , has just gone on sale in india .
it consists of a pen and a touch-sensitive pad that allows users to select from a grid of consonants and then modify them quickly with a pen stroke .
the two combine to form a syllable , significantly speeding-up the process of writing in an indic script .
" for anyone who knows how to write on paper , it takes just 15 to 20 minutes to learn the gesture keyboard , " said shekhar borgaonkar , one of the researchers behind the device .
" for all of the indic languages , this will be the only keyboard needed to enter data into computers , " he said .
the keyboard can be used to write hindi , marathi and kannada , spoken by more than 400 million people .
it costs just over £ 30 -lrb- $ 53 -rrb- and can be used by any machine running windows or linux .
if the gsk takes off it could replace standard keyboards across asia and give people access to computing technology increasingly needed to participate in the modern world .
green machine so far , efforts to bridge the digital divide have largely focused on reducing the cost and complexity of computers .
last year , an indian company launched the simputer , a handheld device designed specifically for the indian market , which failed to make much of an impact .
other offerings include the one laptop per child scheme showcased in 2005 by mit 's nicholas negroponte at the un internet summit in tunis .
the bright green laptops are powered with a wind-up crank , have very low power consumption and will let children interact with each other while learning .

ajay gupta , who heads the indian labs of hewlett packard , said it was a myth that indians wanted cheap goods .
during a visit to the computer giant 's uk headquarters , he urged companies hoping to boost computer use in india to offer innovative solutions and value .
mr gupta 's comments came two weeks after chip maker intel announced a computer specifically for the indian market .
the intel community pc is built to withstand the dust and humidity of many parts of india as well as the sometimes erratic power supply that can damage standard computers .
it will runs on open-source software and has several ways of connecting to the internet , including wireless and the mobile phone standard , gsm .
it will be manufactured in india by computer makers , wipro , esys and hcl and will cost from £ 230 -lrb- $ 400 -rrb- .
intel hopes that the machine will help rural indians gain a level footing with their urban counterparts and allow pcs to be used in areas where it was previously impossible .
stumbling blocks large companies like intel and hewlett packard see india as a potentially huge market for their products .
the country is becoming younger and more affluent .

the ministry of defence said it would make an announcement next month , but opposition parties want answers now .
it has been known since last summer that the government wants to change the way search and rescue is run .
however , it has been reported that the provision of helicopters , crews , training , maintenance and the operation of rescue centres are " up for grabs " .
speculation that it could lead to the sale of bases , including sumburgh in shetland , has led opposition parties to call for the uncertainties to be cleared up .
the snp said it was sceptical that a lifeline service could be privatised .
the conservatives said they would table questions at westminster as soon as parliament reconvened on tuesday .
' no safety advantage ' tim walker , director of the national mountain training centre at glenmore lodge , said that the idea was looked at 15 years ago .
he said : " we also had a very lengthy and expensive parliamentary inquiry just a few years ago .
they concluded that there would be no operational or safety advantage to any change to the system that currently exists .
" part of the conclusion was that the military recovery rescue services exist anyway and will have to exist for their own prime purpose , which is recovery of military aircraft .
" if the raf were not involved in civilian mountain rescue then they would be inventing training exercises to give their pilots and air crew the experience they need to keep them operational . "
mr walker said he believed that the raf rescue teams from lossiemouth and kinloss welcomed the opportunity to get out and be of help to the civilian population .
he said : " we have in scotland , in mountain rescue , a world-class rescue service , there are some 24 teams throughout scotland , all of whom are volunteers and the helicopter support they receive is an integral part of that rescue service . "

the ministry of defence said it would make an announcement next month , but opposition parties want answers now .
it has been known since last summer that the government wants to change the way search and rescue is run .
however , it has been reported that the provision of helicopters , crews , training , maintenance and the operation of rescue centres are " up for grabs " .
speculation that it could lead to the sale of bases , including sumburgh in shetland , has led opposition parties to call for the uncertainties to be cleared up .
the snp said it was sceptical that a lifeline service could be privatised .
the conservatives said they would table questions at westminster as soon as parliament reconvened on tuesday .
' no safety advantage ' tim walker , director of the national mountain training centre at glenmore lodge , said that the idea was looked at 15 years ago .
he said : " we also had a very lengthy and expensive parliamentary inquiry just a few years ago .
they concluded that there would be no operational or safety advantage to any change to the system that currently exists .
" part of the conclusion was that the military recovery rescue services exist anyway and will have to exist for their own prime purpose , which is recovery of military aircraft .
" if the raf were not involved in civilian mountain rescue then they would be inventing training exercises to give their pilots and air crew the experience they need to keep them operational . "
mr walker said he believed that the raf rescue teams from lossiemouth and kinloss welcomed the opportunity to get out and be of help to the civilian population .
he said : " we have in scotland , in mountain rescue , a world-class rescue service , there are some 24 teams throughout scotland , all of whom are volunteers and the helicopter support they receive is an integral part of that rescue service . "

estyn said pupils benefited from activities paid for by the assembly government 's music development fund .
the end of the funding in 2005 means school music services now face an " uncertain future " , estyn claimed .
the assembly government said it was for local authorities to decide the level of music funding in their own areas .
according to estyn , the music development fund - set up in 1999 to reverse a decline in music in schools - helped more than 60,000 young people by financing a growth in musical activities including workshops and master classes .
music services now have to bid for local authority funding every year and they are in competition with other priorities susan lewis chief inspector of education but from april 2005 , the money that had previously gone to the music development fund was transferred into general funding for local authorities .
estyn 's report , published on monday , said the end of the funding programme may leave many local authorities unable to support music programmes at levels which have brought success .
it said nearly all of wales ' 22 local authorities have made cuts in their music service provision .
in a number of areas , budgets for buying musical instruments and the amount of music teaching time have been reduced , while some music festivals are no longer held and some specialist tuition has ceased .
' adverse effect ' susan lewis , chief inspector of education and training in wales , said : " a wide range of projects helped many young people across the country to develop their music skills .
" more pupils gained qualifications in music at gcse , as and a-level thanks to the music development fund .

he said : " it highlights excellent work carried out in music and the use of the £ 17m in funding over the last six years .

a change in land use is proposed in the study land economy by the free market think-tank the adam smith institute .
it says much of the uk 's agricultural land , including land currently labelled as green belt , is not especially green .
the office of the deputy prime minister said planning was key to ensure homes , needed for a growing population , were built in a sustainable way .
study author mischa balen said modern farming techniques turned land into monocultural wastelands that did not provide proper habitats for animals .
' 950,000 houses ' mr balen called for a change in policy where some farms and green belt would be turned into housing and woodlands .
he said : " if some of these were converted to sympathetic development consisting of 90 % woodland , including small lakes and rivers , and 5 % each for housing and supporting infrastructure , each farm whose use was changed in this way would yield almost 200,000 square metres -lrb- 2.15 million sq ft -rrb- of new woodland , together with 140 average-sized new homes . "
mr balen proposed that 3 % of all farmland be converted using this system , which would create 950,000 new houses and 130,000 hectares of woodland , which equated to about an 11 % increase in the woodland cover of england and wales .
the fields so barren of insect , bird and animal life , would be replaced by woods rich in biodiversity mischa balen , report author he said : " none of these new homes would be overlooked by existing houses .
rather , they would be nestled in among new woodland .
" current homeowners would not face a view altered by new buildings .
" on the contrary , they would see the ugly monoculture fields replaced by natural woods , carefully planted to provide a mixture of different types of trees and undergrowth . "
" the fields so barren of insect , bird and animal life , would be replaced by woods rich in biodiversity and providing a habitat for birds and small mammals . "
a spokesman for odpm said : " the government believes we need more new homes for an ageing and growing population .
but we also need to make sure that we build these homes in a sustainable way .
" that is why the planning system is so important .
" it is because of the changes we have already made to the planning system that over 70 % of new housing developments have been built on brownfield land . "
the institute said the proposals were in keeping with conservative party leader david cameron 's recent remarks ahead of changes to planning policy .
' pastoral landscape ' mr balen said current laws led to restrictive planning rules which stifled rural economic growth .
the report said it was crucial to protect the environment and make sure people could afford houses , and this proposal would achieve both .
national farmers ' union spokesman anthony gibson said : " the english countryside is essentially a pastoral landscape , that 's what makes it special .
" i think we ignore the qualities that have given the english landscape the fame and the resonance that it has at our peril ...
" i 'm not sure that very many people would very much enjoy the prospect of seeing vast swaths of the countryside covered in a mixture of concrete and forestry . "

a change in land use is proposed in the study land economy by the free market think-tank the adam smith institute .
it says much of the uk 's agricultural land , including land currently labelled as green belt , is not especially green .
the office of the deputy prime minister said planning was key to ensure homes , needed for a growing population , were built in a sustainable way .
study author mischa balen said modern farming techniques turned land into monocultural wastelands that did not provide proper habitats for animals .
' 950,000 houses ' mr balen called for a change in policy where some farms and green belt would be turned into housing and woodlands .
he said : " if some of these were converted to sympathetic development consisting of 90 % woodland , including small lakes and rivers , and 5 % each for housing and supporting infrastructure , each farm whose use was changed in this way would yield almost 200,000 square metres -lrb- 2.15 million sq ft -rrb- of new woodland , together with 140 average-sized new homes . "
mr balen proposed that 3 % of all farmland be converted using this system , which would create 950,000 new houses and 130,000 hectares of woodland , which equated to about an 11 % increase in the woodland cover of england and wales .
the fields so barren of insect , bird and animal life , would be replaced by woods rich in biodiversity mischa balen , report author he said : " none of these new homes would be overlooked by existing houses .
rather , they would be nestled in among new woodland .
" current homeowners would not face a view altered by new buildings .
" on the contrary , they would see the ugly monoculture fields replaced by natural woods , carefully planted to provide a mixture of different types of trees and undergrowth . "
" the fields so barren of insect , bird and animal life , would be replaced by woods rich in biodiversity and providing a habitat for birds and small mammals . "
a spokesman for odpm said : " the government believes we need more new homes for an ageing and growing population .
but we also need to make sure that we build these homes in a sustainable way .
" that is why the planning system is so important .
" it is because of the changes we have already made to the planning system that over 70 % of new housing developments have been built on brownfield land . "
the institute said the proposals were in keeping with conservative party leader david cameron 's recent remarks ahead of changes to planning policy .
' pastoral landscape ' mr balen said current laws led to restrictive planning rules which stifled rural economic growth .
the report said it was crucial to protect the environment and make sure people could afford houses , and this proposal would achieve both .
national farmers ' union spokesman anthony gibson said : " the english countryside is essentially a pastoral landscape , that 's what makes it special .
" i think we ignore the qualities that have given the english landscape the fame and the resonance that it has at our peril ...
" i 'm not sure that very many people would very much enjoy the prospect of seeing vast swaths of the countryside covered in a mixture of concrete and forestry . "

a change in land use is proposed in the study land economy by the free market think-tank the adam smith institute .
it says much of the uk 's agricultural land , including land currently labelled as green belt , is not especially green .
the office of the deputy prime minister said planning was key to ensure homes , needed for a growing population , were built in a sustainable way .
study author mischa balen said modern farming techniques turned land into monocultural wastelands that did not provide proper habitats for animals .
' 950,000 houses ' mr balen called for a change in policy where some farms and green belt would be turned into housing and woodlands .
he said : " if some of these were converted to sympathetic development consisting of 90 % woodland , including small lakes and rivers , and 5 % each for housing and supporting infrastructure , each farm whose use was changed in this way would yield almost 200,000 square metres -lrb- 2.15 million sq ft -rrb- of new woodland , together with 140 average-sized new homes . "
mr balen proposed that 3 % of all farmland be converted using this system , which would create 950,000 new houses and 130,000 hectares of woodland , which equated to about an 11 % increase in the woodland cover of england and wales .
the fields so barren of insect , bird and animal life , would be replaced by woods rich in biodiversity mischa balen , report author he said : " none of these new homes would be overlooked by existing houses .
rather , they would be nestled in among new woodland .
" current homeowners would not face a view altered by new buildings .
" on the contrary , they would see the ugly monoculture fields replaced by natural woods , carefully planted to provide a mixture of different types of trees and undergrowth . "
" the fields so barren of insect , bird and animal life , would be replaced by woods rich in biodiversity and providing a habitat for birds and small mammals . "
a spokesman for odpm said : " the government believes we need more new homes for an ageing and growing population .
but we also need to make sure that we build these homes in a sustainable way .
" that is why the planning system is so important .
" it is because of the changes we have already made to the planning system that over 70 % of new housing developments have been built on brownfield land . "
the institute said the proposals were in keeping with conservative party leader david cameron 's recent remarks ahead of changes to planning policy .
' pastoral landscape ' mr balen said current laws led to restrictive planning rules which stifled rural economic growth .
the report said it was crucial to protect the environment and make sure people could afford houses , and this proposal would achieve both .
national farmers ' union spokesman anthony gibson said : " the english countryside is essentially a pastoral landscape , that 's what makes it special .
" i think we ignore the qualities that have given the english landscape the fame and the resonance that it has at our peril ...
" i 'm not sure that very many people would very much enjoy the prospect of seeing vast swaths of the countryside covered in a mixture of concrete and forestry . "
