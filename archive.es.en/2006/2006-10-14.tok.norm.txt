a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified .

the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .

" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .
information technology can help make corresponding case law clearer and more coherent . keeping perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing war criminals to justice can take years case matrix also helps keep users from getting bogged down in thousands of small documents and maintain perspective of the case , rackwitz said . " we catalogue the case law , develop it , make catchwords available , " he said .
" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .
rackwitz wants to make it also available as a software application for all computers .
that would allow investigators in far-flung places without a lot of technology to also use the tool . klaus herbst -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top bosnian serb politician gets 27 years for war crimes high-ranking bosnian serb politician momcilo krajisnik was sentenced in the hague to 27 years in prison for his role in bosnia 's " ethnic cleansing " but was acquitted of genocide .

since 1993 , she has made films on topics like identity , exclusion and gender roles . dw-world.de : why do you think that bollywood films have been so successful in germany ? bollywood is only one center of cinema .
india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .
but it is killing all other art expression .

bollywood films are hindi cinema and there are many people in india who can not speak hindi , so they do n't watch bollywood .
they watch whatever is there native language in cinema , which are not ' big cinema ' so they do n't become internationally known .
bollywood makes films in what is recognized as national language in india - that is hindi .
which is in a way the government 's strategy to push hindi down everyone 's throat .
another problem is that a large number of people who are living abroad in europe and america , who we call nri : which means non-residential indian .
they have lived in other countries for generations , they do n't know what india is , but they have a concept of what india should be .
for bollywood , they are very important , because they can pay in hard currency . what are you perceptions of the treatment of female actors in bollywood films ? bildunterschrift : bollywood is described as patriachal and regressive in its portrayal of gender stereotypes bollywood is exactly like hollywood - it is extremely patriarchal and regressive film making .
you will rarely see female film makers who have their standing .
you will hardly see any films that are women-centric .
in feudal times , there was folk theater , which was full of music and song and actually bollywood is only a cinematic version of that .
it is not only regressive to women , but also to minorities , people who are obese , people with disabilities , it is regressive to anyone who does not speak hindi well . the international women 's film festival in cologne and dortmund ends on sunday .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .
the second risk is that we start something ; we get entangled in a net of relationship .
we never know what will come out of it .
finally , i 'd say that this risk is possible only with trust in other people .

14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .
the second risk is that we start something ; we get entangled in a net of relationship .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .
information technology can help make corresponding case law clearer and more coherent . keeping perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing war criminals to justice can take years case matrix also helps keep users from getting bogged down in thousands of small documents and maintain perspective of the case , rackwitz said . " we catalogue the case law , develop it , make catchwords available , " he said .
" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .
rackwitz wants to make it also available as a software application for all computers .
that would allow investigators in far-flung places without a lot of technology to also use the tool . klaus herbst -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top bosnian serb politician gets 27 years for war crimes high-ranking bosnian serb politician momcilo krajisnik was sentenced in the hague to 27 years in prison for his role in bosnia 's " ethnic cleansing " but was acquitted of genocide .

"
clean-cut germany coach joachim löw decided it 's not enough for his players to look good when they 're on the pitch and decided to turn the team into an orderly troupe of well-groomed personalities off the field as well . bastian schweinsteiger looked the perfect gentleman as he stood in a smart suit and fashionable scarf next to chancellor angela merkel on the film premiere 's red carpet . the young bayern munich midfielder , like his teammates in the german national team squad , is cutting sophisticated and stylish figures off the pitch these days . what happens off the field was the subject of a much-hyped documentary " deutschland .
ein sommermärchen " -lrb- germany : a summer 's tale -rrb- .
released in early october , the documentary focuses on the players ' personal lives by concentrating on scenes in the team 's hotel and on the bus as well as their reaction to the massive enthusiasm that engulfed germany during the world cup . film shows players away from the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary went inside the locker room and team hotel director sönke wortmann 's film also shows the team receiving visits from german chancellor angela merkel as well as german president horst köhler , where the players , by then celebrities themselves , greet the politicians with a laid-back nonchalance the officials are seldom likely to experience . with two years until the next major international tournament , manager oliver bierhoff and coach joachim löw are making it clear that being an international soccer star is not just about being able to kick a ball . " we want to form the guys into personalities , both on and off the pitch , " said bierhoff . life lessons for soccer stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wortmann gave players a few tips to improve their own home videos that means encouraging the players to look beyond the game .
joining the national team means also learning some all-round lessons for life under a philosophy first encouraged by former coach jürgen klinsmann . the days when a computer game was the most important object to pack with the kit or a game of cards the main leisure activity for a national team player seem to be over . a trip to the shah 's palace in iran , a boat trip on the bosporus or a clock-making course in switzerland have all been on the agenda recently for german players . consultants share secrets to success not only are these sort of activities designed to forge team bonding they are to encourage players normally living in a football microcosm to turn their minds to other things in life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski , left , and david odonkor are getting lessons in how to look good off the field " we will be continuing to do things like this in the future to show the players a few things outside their sport .
it 's all about increasing their awareness , " said bierhoff . klinsmann began this approach in his two years in charge leading up to the world cup when he invited experts from outside football to give lectures to the squad .
these have included free climber stefan glowacz or herbert henzler , former germany chief for business consultants mckinsey , outlining their secrets for success . former german national hockey coach bernhard peters was also invited and impressed klinsmann and löw so much that he has now become a consultant to the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one spoon for soup , another for dessert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team officials make sure players have some fun between lessons and matches the players were even given a crash-course in etiquette .
the players were briefed on good manners by an expert using guidelines set out in a classic german book on good behavior , the knigge guide written by adolph freiherr knigge in the late 18th century . no matter what happens on the field of play , the germans are to be a team with manners . yet even the senior members of the squad like 36-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann still have something to learn . " i did n't know that you had to eat faster so as not to embarrass your dining partner , " he admitted after the knigge course . not just " yes , please " and " no , thank you " but it 's not all formal and polite when the german team get together .
at the team hotel this week bierhoff had a giant scalectrix-type racing-car track set up for the players to let off steam - all part of the team-building effort . the team 's sports psychologist hans-dieter hermann and chief scout urs siegenthaler also play key roles in the all-round schooling . during the world cup , siegenthaler briefed the players not only on the team and tactics of germany 's opponents but also on the culture , history and mentality of the people in opposing teams ' countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany underscore euro 2008 aspirations germany win easily in bratislava while group d leaders czech republic stumble with a 1-1 draw in dublin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 14.10.2006 eu to pull plug on negotiations with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has pursued a diplomatic resolution through dialogue with iran since the crisis began the eu will officially announce an end to negotiations with iran over its nuclear program and will recommend that the issue be taken up by the un security council .
however , officials maintain an offer stays on the table . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has warned that there is little prospect of successful talks with iran on its nuclear program , but stressed in an interview broadcast saturday that an incentives package aimed at defusing the issue remained on the table . " we do not at the moment have a situation in which negotiations can be held with prospects of success , so the -lrb- u.n. -rrb-
security council must take up its efforts " to work toward possible sanctions , steinmeier said on inforadio .
" but we have made equally clear that our offer for cooperation with iran remains on the table .
that means we are ready to return to the negotiating table any time if iran declares its readiness to accept the conditions for negotiations , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the eu would still be ready to talk steinmeier friday said the path was clear for the un security council to intervene in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program . the german foreign minister 's comments come a day after the eu released a draft announcement that talks with iran over its nuclear program had failed and that the bloc 's negotiating team was going to leave it up to the un security council to consider punitive action , official sources said friday . eu sees itself left with no choice the news of an official breakdown of talks would be confirmed early next week at a european foreign ministers meeting next tuesday .
the draft announcement said that the eu nations now believed that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice , " but to throw the issue back to the un . bildunterschrift : the talks between the eu and iran will be suspended the ministers ' conclusions on iran , drawn up by the european union 's 25 member nations , expressed " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog and a security council resolution . the french foreign ministry said friday a " broad agreement " existed between the six world powers engaged in the iran issue , the security council five plus germany , about un measures over iran 's nuclear program . " this means that there is no argument against letting the security council deal with the matter , " a spokesman for the ministry told reporters in paris .
" it 's clear that we are now going to work in new york -lrb- un -rrb- very soon , " said ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei . however the door to talks remains open , he added .
" to double-lock the door to negotiations is not our vision of things . " ministers meeting in luxembourg will signal end a european diplomat went further , saying that the eu foreign ministers will formally end negotiations with tehran over iran 's nuclear ambitions at their talks in luxembourg . the ministers are due to declare that " negotiations with iran have terminated because of a lack of results , " the diplomat said on condition of anonymity .
however , the draft of the meeting 's conclusions dating from october 11 does not include that sentence . senior diplomats from the six - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - discussed the sanctions during a videoconference wednesday morning , state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters .
" i think there is broad agreement on the potential sanctions that would be included , but not yet agreement on the specific items that would be in a resolution , that has to be worked out , " he said . threat of sanctions increases bildunterschrift : the security council will now discuss the iran crisis the six have been debating for weeks over the kinds of sanctions to slap on iran for ignoring an august 31 un deadline to suspend a uranium enrichment program that washington and others fear will be subverted to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons . under un security council article 41 , members may " decide what measures , not involving the use of armed force , are to be employed to give effect to its decisions . " these may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail , sea , air , postal , telegraphic , radio , and other means of communication , and the severance of diplomatic relations . but china and russia , which both wield veto power on the security council , have balked at imposing the kind of punitive measures sought by washington , with the backing of britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .
information technology can help make corresponding case law clearer and more coherent . keeping perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing war criminals to justice can take years case matrix also helps keep users from getting bogged down in thousands of small documents and maintain perspective of the case , rackwitz said .

" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .
rackwitz wants to make it also available as a software application for all computers .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified .

historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .

"
clean-cut germany coach joachim löw decided it 's not enough for his players to look good when they 're on the pitch and decided to turn the team into an orderly troupe of well-groomed personalities off the field as well . bastian schweinsteiger looked the perfect gentleman as he stood in a smart suit and fashionable scarf next to chancellor angela merkel on the film premiere 's red carpet . the young bayern munich midfielder , like his teammates in the german national team squad , is cutting sophisticated and stylish figures off the pitch these days . what happens off the field was the subject of a much-hyped documentary " deutschland .
ein sommermärchen " -lrb- germany : a summer 's tale -rrb- .
released in early october , the documentary focuses on the players ' personal lives by concentrating on scenes in the team 's hotel and on the bus as well as their reaction to the massive enthusiasm that engulfed germany during the world cup . film shows players away from the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary went inside the locker room and team hotel director sönke wortmann 's film also shows the team receiving visits from german chancellor angela merkel as well as german president horst köhler , where the players , by then celebrities themselves , greet the politicians with a laid-back nonchalance the officials are seldom likely to experience . with two years until the next major international tournament , manager oliver bierhoff and coach joachim löw are making it clear that being an international soccer star is not just about being able to kick a ball . " we want to form the guys into personalities , both on and off the pitch , " said bierhoff . life lessons for soccer stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wortmann gave players a few tips to improve their own home videos that means encouraging the players to look beyond the game .
joining the national team means also learning some all-round lessons for life under a philosophy first encouraged by former coach jürgen klinsmann . the days when a computer game was the most important object to pack with the kit or a game of cards the main leisure activity for a national team player seem to be over . a trip to the shah 's palace in iran , a boat trip on the bosporus or a clock-making course in switzerland have all been on the agenda recently for german players . consultants share secrets to success not only are these sort of activities designed to forge team bonding they are to encourage players normally living in a football microcosm to turn their minds to other things in life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski , left , and david odonkor are getting lessons in how to look good off the field " we will be continuing to do things like this in the future to show the players a few things outside their sport .
it 's all about increasing their awareness , " said bierhoff . klinsmann began this approach in his two years in charge leading up to the world cup when he invited experts from outside football to give lectures to the squad .
these have included free climber stefan glowacz or herbert henzler , former germany chief for business consultants mckinsey , outlining their secrets for success . former german national hockey coach bernhard peters was also invited and impressed klinsmann and löw so much that he has now become a consultant to the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one spoon for soup , another for dessert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team officials make sure players have some fun between lessons and matches the players were even given a crash-course in etiquette .
the players were briefed on good manners by an expert using guidelines set out in a classic german book on good behavior , the knigge guide written by adolph freiherr knigge in the late 18th century . no matter what happens on the field of play , the germans are to be a team with manners . yet even the senior members of the squad like 36-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann still have something to learn . " i did n't know that you had to eat faster so as not to embarrass your dining partner , " he admitted after the knigge course . not just " yes , please " and " no , thank you " but it 's not all formal and polite when the german team get together .
at the team hotel this week bierhoff had a giant scalectrix-type racing-car track set up for the players to let off steam - all part of the team-building effort . the team 's sports psychologist hans-dieter hermann and chief scout urs siegenthaler also play key roles in the all-round schooling . during the world cup , siegenthaler briefed the players not only on the team and tactics of germany 's opponents but also on the culture , history and mentality of the people in opposing teams ' countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany underscore euro 2008 aspirations germany win easily in bratislava while group d leaders czech republic stumble with a 1-1 draw in dublin .

whatever is new and trendy for christmas 2006 can be found there .
for germans , that means decking the christmas tree in patriotic yellow-red-black this year .

the wohlfahrt family got its start in the 1960s selling german christmas tradition , like music boxes from the famous crafts-producing erzgebirge region , at bazaars held on us military bases . the german company krebs glas lauscha , which makes glass ornaments , expanded to the us in the 1970s with christmas by krebs .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .

although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .

i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .

arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .

she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .

" the selling started here in germany at the end of september , " said alexandra jaspert , a spokeswoman for the christmas trade fair in hanover . the hanover fair will have 150 vendors selling every type of christmas-related bauble , food and fashion imaginable .
whatever is new and trendy for christmas 2006 can be found there .
for germans , that means decking the christmas tree in patriotic yellow-red-black this year .

the wohlfahrt family got its start in the 1960s selling german christmas tradition , like music boxes from the famous crafts-producing erzgebirge region , at bazaars held on us military bases . the german company krebs glas lauscha , which makes glass ornaments , expanded to the us in the 1970s with christmas by krebs .
they have an office in new mexico and a showroom in dallas , texas . us households spent an estimated $ 6.5 billion -lrb- 5.18 billion euros -rrb- on christmas-related decorations in 2005 .

while 80 percent of germans do not want to start seeing christmas cookies and chocolate santa clauses for sale in october , according to the evangelical lutheran group , only 45 percent wait for advent to buy christmas products in the supermarkets . margot kässmann , the bishop for the evangelical lutheran church in hanover , encourages christians to make a political statement with their shopping baskets .
mercilessly marketing advent and christmas is the opposite message of what religion teaches , she said in a statement posted on the church 's web site . meanwhile , in hanover , the diehards load ornaments into their cars , munch gingerbread and count the months until christmas eve . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de christmas trees take a bizarre twist twinkling lights and bright ornaments are the traditional dress for a christmas tree .

india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .

since 1993 , she has made films on topics like identity , exclusion and gender roles . dw-world.de : why do you think that bollywood films have been so successful in germany ? bollywood is only one center of cinema .
india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .
but it is killing all other art expression .
either you are in mainstream , homogenized , bollywood - or you are out .
and that is a very big problem . so how diverse is indian film ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from dutta 's film " made in india " which explores visual arts in india india has many languages .
bollywood films are hindi cinema and there are many people in india who can not speak hindi , so they do n't watch bollywood .
they watch whatever is there native language in cinema , which are not ' big cinema ' so they do n't become internationally known .
bollywood makes films in what is recognized as national language in india - that is hindi .
which is in a way the government 's strategy to push hindi down everyone 's throat .
another problem is that a large number of people who are living abroad in europe and america , who we call nri : which means non-residential indian .
they have lived in other countries for generations , they do n't know what india is , but they have a concept of what india should be .
for bollywood , they are very important , because they can pay in hard currency . what are you perceptions of the treatment of female actors in bollywood films ? bildunterschrift : bollywood is described as patriachal and regressive in its portrayal of gender stereotypes bollywood is exactly like hollywood - it is extremely patriarchal and regressive film making .
you will rarely see female film makers who have their standing .
you will hardly see any films that are women-centric .
in feudal times , there was folk theater , which was full of music and song and actually bollywood is only a cinematic version of that .
it is not only regressive to women , but also to minorities , people who are obese , people with disabilities , it is regressive to anyone who does not speak hindi well . the international women 's film festival in cologne and dortmund ends on sunday .
with a focus on iran and india , about 120 films from 32 countries were shown . rachel ryan interviewed madusree dutta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .

it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .
the second risk is that we start something ; we get entangled in a net of relationship .
we never know what will come out of it .
finally , i 'd say that this risk is possible only with trust in other people .

" the first half was fantastic .
the team is playing consistently strong .
there has not been this level of performance over a long period of time for many years , " beckenbauer told the mass-market bild newspaper friday . the former soccer great , who also served as head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , said he was impressed with the german national side which since the world cup under new coach joachim löw has won all five of their games , scoring 23 goals while conceding just one . löw 's team tops world cup side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim löw is the mastermind behind the german team 's recent success " i 've seen even more improvement , " beckenbauer said .
" at the world cup you could feel the determination to win .
now a lightness has come to it as well . " germany handily defeated slovakia 4-1 in bratislava on wednesday to continue the form they showed in reaching the world cup semi-finals and took a big step towards euro 2008 in austria and switzerland . " we ca n't speak yet of the european championship title .
that 's really too early with almost two years to go , " he said .
" but when i see how other big nations are stumbling through the qualifications we are at the moment miles ahead . " . the statement was directed at world cup winners italy , runners-up france and england , who have all dropped points in their euro 2008 campaigns . national teams stars faltering in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has had less to celebrate with bayern munich , where he warms the bench beckenbauer added it was noticeable that the leading bundesliga clubs appeared to be struggling while the national team was playing so well . two bayern munich players , lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger , have shone playing for germany , but podolski is struggling to claim a first-team place at bayern while schweinsteiger 's club form has been patchy . beckenbauer said he would like to see schweinsteiger play as well for bayern where he seemed " much more inhibited . " last week , beckenbauer had told bild , " the football played by our national team is a lot stronger and is more enjoyable than that which is being played in the bundesliga . " the " kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known in germany , meanwhile said the hooligans who clashed with police in slovakia would not ruin the good reputation of german fans won at the world cup . however germany had to be careful it did not become " a hooligan nation " with " the hosts trembling when germany comes . " " these violent hordes are terrible , " he added .
" i can only hope that they will be completely stopped before the next away game and do n't appear again in the stadiums .

"
clean-cut germany coach joachim löw decided it 's not enough for his players to look good when they 're on the pitch and decided to turn the team into an orderly troupe of well-groomed personalities off the field as well . bastian schweinsteiger looked the perfect gentleman as he stood in a smart suit and fashionable scarf next to chancellor angela merkel on the film premiere 's red carpet . the young bayern munich midfielder , like his teammates in the german national team squad , is cutting sophisticated and stylish figures off the pitch these days . what happens off the field was the subject of a much-hyped documentary " deutschland .
ein sommermärchen " -lrb- germany : a summer 's tale -rrb- .
released in early october , the documentary focuses on the players ' personal lives by concentrating on scenes in the team 's hotel and on the bus as well as their reaction to the massive enthusiasm that engulfed germany during the world cup . film shows players away from the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary went inside the locker room and team hotel director sönke wortmann 's film also shows the team receiving visits from german chancellor angela merkel as well as german president horst köhler , where the players , by then celebrities themselves , greet the politicians with a laid-back nonchalance the officials are seldom likely to experience . with two years until the next major international tournament , manager oliver bierhoff and coach joachim löw are making it clear that being an international soccer star is not just about being able to kick a ball . " we want to form the guys into personalities , both on and off the pitch , " said bierhoff . life lessons for soccer stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wortmann gave players a few tips to improve their own home videos that means encouraging the players to look beyond the game .
joining the national team means also learning some all-round lessons for life under a philosophy first encouraged by former coach jürgen klinsmann . the days when a computer game was the most important object to pack with the kit or a game of cards the main leisure activity for a national team player seem to be over . a trip to the shah 's palace in iran , a boat trip on the bosporus or a clock-making course in switzerland have all been on the agenda recently for german players . consultants share secrets to success not only are these sort of activities designed to forge team bonding they are to encourage players normally living in a football microcosm to turn their minds to other things in life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski , left , and david odonkor are getting lessons in how to look good off the field " we will be continuing to do things like this in the future to show the players a few things outside their sport .
it 's all about increasing their awareness , " said bierhoff . klinsmann began this approach in his two years in charge leading up to the world cup when he invited experts from outside football to give lectures to the squad .
these have included free climber stefan glowacz or herbert henzler , former germany chief for business consultants mckinsey , outlining their secrets for success . former german national hockey coach bernhard peters was also invited and impressed klinsmann and löw so much that he has now become a consultant to the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one spoon for soup , another for dessert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team officials make sure players have some fun between lessons and matches the players were even given a crash-course in etiquette .
the players were briefed on good manners by an expert using guidelines set out in a classic german book on good behavior , the knigge guide written by adolph freiherr knigge in the late 18th century . no matter what happens on the field of play , the germans are to be a team with manners . yet even the senior members of the squad like 36-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann still have something to learn . " i did n't know that you had to eat faster so as not to embarrass your dining partner , " he admitted after the knigge course . not just " yes , please " and " no , thank you " but it 's not all formal and polite when the german team get together .
at the team hotel this week bierhoff had a giant scalectrix-type racing-car track set up for the players to let off steam - all part of the team-building effort . the team 's sports psychologist hans-dieter hermann and chief scout urs siegenthaler also play key roles in the all-round schooling . during the world cup , siegenthaler briefed the players not only on the team and tactics of germany 's opponents but also on the culture , history and mentality of the people in opposing teams ' countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany underscore euro 2008 aspirations germany win easily in bratislava while group d leaders czech republic stumble with a 1-1 draw in dublin .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .

historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .

" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified .

his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .

the wohlfahrt family got its start in the 1960s selling german christmas tradition , like music boxes from the famous crafts-producing erzgebirge region , at bazaars held on us military bases . the german company krebs glas lauscha , which makes glass ornaments , expanded to the us in the 1970s with christmas by krebs .

however , officials maintain an offer stays on the table . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has warned that there is little prospect of successful talks with iran on its nuclear program , but stressed in an interview broadcast saturday that an incentives package aimed at defusing the issue remained on the table . " we do not at the moment have a situation in which negotiations can be held with prospects of success , so the -lrb- u.n. -rrb-
security council must take up its efforts " to work toward possible sanctions , steinmeier said on inforadio .
" but we have made equally clear that our offer for cooperation with iran remains on the table .
that means we are ready to return to the negotiating table any time if iran declares its readiness to accept the conditions for negotiations , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the eu would still be ready to talk steinmeier friday said the path was clear for the un security council to intervene in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program . the german foreign minister 's comments come a day after the eu released a draft announcement that talks with iran over its nuclear program had failed and that the bloc 's negotiating team was going to leave it up to the un security council to consider punitive action , official sources said friday . eu sees itself left with no choice the news of an official breakdown of talks would be confirmed early next week at a european foreign ministers meeting next tuesday .
the draft announcement said that the eu nations now believed that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice , " but to throw the issue back to the un . bildunterschrift : the talks between the eu and iran will be suspended the ministers ' conclusions on iran , drawn up by the european union 's 25 member nations , expressed " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog and a security council resolution . the french foreign ministry said friday a " broad agreement " existed between the six world powers engaged in the iran issue , the security council five plus germany , about un measures over iran 's nuclear program . " this means that there is no argument against letting the security council deal with the matter , " a spokesman for the ministry told reporters in paris .
" it 's clear that we are now going to work in new york -lrb- un -rrb- very soon , " said ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei . however the door to talks remains open , he added .
" to double-lock the door to negotiations is not our vision of things . " ministers meeting in luxembourg will signal end a european diplomat went further , saying that the eu foreign ministers will formally end negotiations with tehran over iran 's nuclear ambitions at their talks in luxembourg . the ministers are due to declare that " negotiations with iran have terminated because of a lack of results , " the diplomat said on condition of anonymity .
however , the draft of the meeting 's conclusions dating from october 11 does not include that sentence . senior diplomats from the six - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - discussed the sanctions during a videoconference wednesday morning , state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters .
" i think there is broad agreement on the potential sanctions that would be included , but not yet agreement on the specific items that would be in a resolution , that has to be worked out , " he said . threat of sanctions increases bildunterschrift : the security council will now discuss the iran crisis the six have been debating for weeks over the kinds of sanctions to slap on iran for ignoring an august 31 un deadline to suspend a uranium enrichment program that washington and others fear will be subverted to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons . under un security council article 41 , members may " decide what measures , not involving the use of armed force , are to be employed to give effect to its decisions . " these may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail , sea , air , postal , telegraphic , radio , and other means of communication , and the severance of diplomatic relations . but china and russia , which both wield veto power on the security council , have balked at imposing the kind of punitive measures sought by washington , with the backing of britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
-lrb- 30.09.2006 -rrb- iran : eu nuke talks " step in the right direction " a sudden change of venue from paris to geneva failed to smooth over the discord at iran-eu nuclear talks .
despite positive comments , solutions remained distant .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .
information technology can help make corresponding case law clearer and more coherent . keeping perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing war criminals to justice can take years case matrix also helps keep users from getting bogged down in thousands of small documents and maintain perspective of the case , rackwitz said .

" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .

the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .
information technology can help make corresponding case law clearer and more coherent . keeping perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing war criminals to justice can take years case matrix also helps keep users from getting bogged down in thousands of small documents and maintain perspective of the case , rackwitz said .

" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .

although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .

she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .

although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .

even as religious groups try to reign in commercialization of the holiday , christmas remains a hot item abroad . more than two months before the big day , the german christmas industry has unwrapped the tinsel and colored lights .
seem a little early ?
in germany , christmas trading normally gets underway in september .
the 2006 christmas decoration catalogues shipped last month and grocery store shelves have sported christmas cookies for nearly as long . this weekend , a massive christmas trade fair brings the commercial side of christmas to the masses in hanover . " the selling started here in germany at the end of september , " said alexandra jaspert , a spokeswoman for the christmas trade fair in hanover . the hanover fair will have 150 vendors selling every type of christmas-related bauble , food and fashion imaginable .
whatever is new and trendy for christmas 2006 can be found there .
for germans , that means decking the christmas tree in patriotic yellow-red-black this year .
while september jumps the gun for selling christmas , mid-october is fair game , jaspert said . " we 're pretty early this year but when all the christmas markets start it 's too late for us because all our exhibitors will be there , " jaspert said . going international bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand-made ornaments are popular export items german christmas - with it 's tradition of hand-made craftsmanship - went international decades ago .
you can see it at the christmas markets in germany , where vendors toggle between five languages in a day and have signs in japanese . take käthe wohlfahrt , a year-round christmas empire with an internationally famous store .
the wohlfahrt family got its start in the 1960s selling german christmas tradition , like music boxes from the famous crafts-producing erzgebirge region , at bazaars held on us military bases . the german company krebs glas lauscha , which makes glass ornaments , expanded to the us in the 1970s with christmas by krebs .
they have an office in new mexico and a showroom in dallas , texas . us households spent an estimated $ 6.5 billion -lrb- 5.18 billion euros -rrb- on christmas-related decorations in 2005 .

" they want things that are really produced here in germany . " at the year-round wohlfahrt christmas store , traffic picks up in september .

germany 's evangelical lutheran church has vocally lobbied for people to moderate buying habits . but contradictions exist .
while 80 percent of germans do not want to start seeing christmas cookies and chocolate santa clauses for sale in october , according to the evangelical lutheran group , only 45 percent wait for advent to buy christmas products in the supermarkets . margot kässmann , the bishop for the evangelical lutheran church in hanover , encourages christians to make a political statement with their shopping baskets .
mercilessly marketing advent and christmas is the opposite message of what religion teaches , she said in a statement posted on the church 's web site . meanwhile , in hanover , the diehards load ornaments into their cars , munch gingerbread and count the months until christmas eve . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de christmas trees take a bizarre twist twinkling lights and bright ornaments are the traditional dress for a christmas tree .

india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .
but it is killing all other art expression .

they watch whatever is there native language in cinema , which are not ' big cinema ' so they do n't become internationally known .
bollywood makes films in what is recognized as national language in india - that is hindi .

another problem is that a large number of people who are living abroad in europe and america , who we call nri : which means non-residential indian .
they have lived in other countries for generations , they do n't know what india is , but they have a concept of what india should be .

since 1993 , she has made films on topics like identity , exclusion and gender roles . dw-world.de : why do you think that bollywood films have been so successful in germany ? bollywood is only one center of cinema .
india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .
but it is killing all other art expression .
either you are in mainstream , homogenized , bollywood - or you are out .
and that is a very big problem . so how diverse is indian film ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from dutta 's film " made in india " which explores visual arts in india india has many languages .
bollywood films are hindi cinema and there are many people in india who can not speak hindi , so they do n't watch bollywood .
they watch whatever is there native language in cinema , which are not ' big cinema ' so they do n't become internationally known .
bollywood makes films in what is recognized as national language in india - that is hindi .
which is in a way the government 's strategy to push hindi down everyone 's throat .
another problem is that a large number of people who are living abroad in europe and america , who we call nri : which means non-residential indian .
they have lived in other countries for generations , they do n't know what india is , but they have a concept of what india should be .
for bollywood , they are very important , because they can pay in hard currency . what are you perceptions of the treatment of female actors in bollywood films ? bildunterschrift : bollywood is described as patriachal and regressive in its portrayal of gender stereotypes bollywood is exactly like hollywood - it is extremely patriarchal and regressive film making .
you will rarely see female film makers who have their standing .
you will hardly see any films that are women-centric .
in feudal times , there was folk theater , which was full of music and song and actually bollywood is only a cinematic version of that .
it is not only regressive to women , but also to minorities , people who are obese , people with disabilities , it is regressive to anyone who does not speak hindi well . the international women 's film festival in cologne and dortmund ends on sunday .

"
clean-cut germany coach joachim löw decided it 's not enough for his players to look good when they 're on the pitch and decided to turn the team into an orderly troupe of well-groomed personalities off the field as well . bastian schweinsteiger looked the perfect gentleman as he stood in a smart suit and fashionable scarf next to chancellor angela merkel on the film premiere 's red carpet . the young bayern munich midfielder , like his teammates in the german national team squad , is cutting sophisticated and stylish figures off the pitch these days . what happens off the field was the subject of a much-hyped documentary " deutschland .
ein sommermärchen " -lrb- germany : a summer 's tale -rrb- .
released in early october , the documentary focuses on the players ' personal lives by concentrating on scenes in the team 's hotel and on the bus as well as their reaction to the massive enthusiasm that engulfed germany during the world cup . film shows players away from the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary went inside the locker room and team hotel director sönke wortmann 's film also shows the team receiving visits from german chancellor angela merkel as well as german president horst köhler , where the players , by then celebrities themselves , greet the politicians with a laid-back nonchalance the officials are seldom likely to experience . with two years until the next major international tournament , manager oliver bierhoff and coach joachim löw are making it clear that being an international soccer star is not just about being able to kick a ball . " we want to form the guys into personalities , both on and off the pitch , " said bierhoff . life lessons for soccer stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wortmann gave players a few tips to improve their own home videos that means encouraging the players to look beyond the game .
joining the national team means also learning some all-round lessons for life under a philosophy first encouraged by former coach jürgen klinsmann . the days when a computer game was the most important object to pack with the kit or a game of cards the main leisure activity for a national team player seem to be over . a trip to the shah 's palace in iran , a boat trip on the bosporus or a clock-making course in switzerland have all been on the agenda recently for german players . consultants share secrets to success not only are these sort of activities designed to forge team bonding they are to encourage players normally living in a football microcosm to turn their minds to other things in life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski , left , and david odonkor are getting lessons in how to look good off the field " we will be continuing to do things like this in the future to show the players a few things outside their sport .
it 's all about increasing their awareness , " said bierhoff . klinsmann began this approach in his two years in charge leading up to the world cup when he invited experts from outside football to give lectures to the squad .
these have included free climber stefan glowacz or herbert henzler , former germany chief for business consultants mckinsey , outlining their secrets for success . former german national hockey coach bernhard peters was also invited and impressed klinsmann and löw so much that he has now become a consultant to the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one spoon for soup , another for dessert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team officials make sure players have some fun between lessons and matches the players were even given a crash-course in etiquette .
the players were briefed on good manners by an expert using guidelines set out in a classic german book on good behavior , the knigge guide written by adolph freiherr knigge in the late 18th century . no matter what happens on the field of play , the germans are to be a team with manners . yet even the senior members of the squad like 36-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann still have something to learn . " i did n't know that you had to eat faster so as not to embarrass your dining partner , " he admitted after the knigge course . not just " yes , please " and " no , thank you " but it 's not all formal and polite when the german team get together .
at the team hotel this week bierhoff had a giant scalectrix-type racing-car track set up for the players to let off steam - all part of the team-building effort . the team 's sports psychologist hans-dieter hermann and chief scout urs siegenthaler also play key roles in the all-round schooling . during the world cup , siegenthaler briefed the players not only on the team and tactics of germany 's opponents but also on the culture , history and mentality of the people in opposing teams ' countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany underscore euro 2008 aspirations germany win easily in bratislava while group d leaders czech republic stumble with a 1-1 draw in dublin .

"
clean-cut germany coach joachim löw decided it 's not enough for his players to look good when they 're on the pitch and decided to turn the team into an orderly troupe of well-groomed personalities off the field as well . bastian schweinsteiger looked the perfect gentleman as he stood in a smart suit and fashionable scarf next to chancellor angela merkel on the film premiere 's red carpet . the young bayern munich midfielder , like his teammates in the german national team squad , is cutting sophisticated and stylish figures off the pitch these days . what happens off the field was the subject of a much-hyped documentary " deutschland .
ein sommermärchen " -lrb- germany : a summer 's tale -rrb- .
released in early october , the documentary focuses on the players ' personal lives by concentrating on scenes in the team 's hotel and on the bus as well as their reaction to the massive enthusiasm that engulfed germany during the world cup . film shows players away from the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary went inside the locker room and team hotel director sönke wortmann 's film also shows the team receiving visits from german chancellor angela merkel as well as german president horst köhler , where the players , by then celebrities themselves , greet the politicians with a laid-back nonchalance the officials are seldom likely to experience . with two years until the next major international tournament , manager oliver bierhoff and coach joachim löw are making it clear that being an international soccer star is not just about being able to kick a ball . " we want to form the guys into personalities , both on and off the pitch , " said bierhoff . life lessons for soccer stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wortmann gave players a few tips to improve their own home videos that means encouraging the players to look beyond the game .
joining the national team means also learning some all-round lessons for life under a philosophy first encouraged by former coach jürgen klinsmann . the days when a computer game was the most important object to pack with the kit or a game of cards the main leisure activity for a national team player seem to be over . a trip to the shah 's palace in iran , a boat trip on the bosporus or a clock-making course in switzerland have all been on the agenda recently for german players . consultants share secrets to success not only are these sort of activities designed to forge team bonding they are to encourage players normally living in a football microcosm to turn their minds to other things in life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski , left , and david odonkor are getting lessons in how to look good off the field " we will be continuing to do things like this in the future to show the players a few things outside their sport .
it 's all about increasing their awareness , " said bierhoff . klinsmann began this approach in his two years in charge leading up to the world cup when he invited experts from outside football to give lectures to the squad .
these have included free climber stefan glowacz or herbert henzler , former germany chief for business consultants mckinsey , outlining their secrets for success . former german national hockey coach bernhard peters was also invited and impressed klinsmann and löw so much that he has now become a consultant to the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one spoon for soup , another for dessert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team officials make sure players have some fun between lessons and matches the players were even given a crash-course in etiquette .
the players were briefed on good manners by an expert using guidelines set out in a classic german book on good behavior , the knigge guide written by adolph freiherr knigge in the late 18th century . no matter what happens on the field of play , the germans are to be a team with manners . yet even the senior members of the squad like 36-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann still have something to learn . " i did n't know that you had to eat faster so as not to embarrass your dining partner , " he admitted after the knigge course . not just " yes , please " and " no , thank you " but it 's not all formal and polite when the german team get together .
at the team hotel this week bierhoff had a giant scalectrix-type racing-car track set up for the players to let off steam - all part of the team-building effort . the team 's sports psychologist hans-dieter hermann and chief scout urs siegenthaler also play key roles in the all-round schooling . during the world cup , siegenthaler briefed the players not only on the team and tactics of germany 's opponents but also on the culture , history and mentality of the people in opposing teams ' countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany underscore euro 2008 aspirations germany win easily in bratislava while group d leaders czech republic stumble with a 1-1 draw in dublin .
although still early in the quals , a spot amongst the top two is nearer for germany .

"
clean-cut germany coach joachim löw decided it 's not enough for his players to look good when they 're on the pitch and decided to turn the team into an orderly troupe of well-groomed personalities off the field as well . bastian schweinsteiger looked the perfect gentleman as he stood in a smart suit and fashionable scarf next to chancellor angela merkel on the film premiere 's red carpet . the young bayern munich midfielder , like his teammates in the german national team squad , is cutting sophisticated and stylish figures off the pitch these days . what happens off the field was the subject of a much-hyped documentary " deutschland .
ein sommermärchen " -lrb- germany : a summer 's tale -rrb- .
released in early october , the documentary focuses on the players ' personal lives by concentrating on scenes in the team 's hotel and on the bus as well as their reaction to the massive enthusiasm that engulfed germany during the world cup . film shows players away from the game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary went inside the locker room and team hotel director sönke wortmann 's film also shows the team receiving visits from german chancellor angela merkel as well as german president horst köhler , where the players , by then celebrities themselves , greet the politicians with a laid-back nonchalance the officials are seldom likely to experience . with two years until the next major international tournament , manager oliver bierhoff and coach joachim löw are making it clear that being an international soccer star is not just about being able to kick a ball . " we want to form the guys into personalities , both on and off the pitch , " said bierhoff . life lessons for soccer stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wortmann gave players a few tips to improve their own home videos that means encouraging the players to look beyond the game .
joining the national team means also learning some all-round lessons for life under a philosophy first encouraged by former coach jürgen klinsmann . the days when a computer game was the most important object to pack with the kit or a game of cards the main leisure activity for a national team player seem to be over . a trip to the shah 's palace in iran , a boat trip on the bosporus or a clock-making course in switzerland have all been on the agenda recently for german players . consultants share secrets to success not only are these sort of activities designed to forge team bonding they are to encourage players normally living in a football microcosm to turn their minds to other things in life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski , left , and david odonkor are getting lessons in how to look good off the field " we will be continuing to do things like this in the future to show the players a few things outside their sport .
it 's all about increasing their awareness , " said bierhoff . klinsmann began this approach in his two years in charge leading up to the world cup when he invited experts from outside football to give lectures to the squad .
these have included free climber stefan glowacz or herbert henzler , former germany chief for business consultants mckinsey , outlining their secrets for success . former german national hockey coach bernhard peters was also invited and impressed klinsmann and löw so much that he has now become a consultant to the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one spoon for soup , another for dessert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team officials make sure players have some fun between lessons and matches the players were even given a crash-course in etiquette .
the players were briefed on good manners by an expert using guidelines set out in a classic german book on good behavior , the knigge guide written by adolph freiherr knigge in the late 18th century . no matter what happens on the field of play , the germans are to be a team with manners . yet even the senior members of the squad like 36-year-old goalkeeper jens lehmann still have something to learn . " i did n't know that you had to eat faster so as not to embarrass your dining partner , " he admitted after the knigge course . not just " yes , please " and " no , thank you " but it 's not all formal and polite when the german team get together .
at the team hotel this week bierhoff had a giant scalectrix-type racing-car track set up for the players to let off steam - all part of the team-building effort . the team 's sports psychologist hans-dieter hermann and chief scout urs siegenthaler also play key roles in the all-round schooling . during the world cup , siegenthaler briefed the players not only on the team and tactics of germany 's opponents but also on the culture , history and mentality of the people in opposing teams ' countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany underscore euro 2008 aspirations germany win easily in bratislava while group d leaders czech republic stumble with a 1-1 draw in dublin .
although still early in the quals , a spot amongst the top two is nearer for germany .
-lrb- 11.10.2006 -rrb- a fly-on-the-wall look at germany 's world cup campaign sönke wortmann 's " germany : a summer 's tale " tells the story of how former german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann took a team in disarray to a third-place finish in the world cup .

however , officials maintain an offer stays on the table . germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has warned that there is little prospect of successful talks with iran on its nuclear program , but stressed in an interview broadcast saturday that an incentives package aimed at defusing the issue remained on the table . " we do not at the moment have a situation in which negotiations can be held with prospects of success , so the -lrb- u.n. -rrb-
security council must take up its efforts " to work toward possible sanctions , steinmeier said on inforadio .
" but we have made equally clear that our offer for cooperation with iran remains on the table .
that means we are ready to return to the negotiating table any time if iran declares its readiness to accept the conditions for negotiations , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the eu would still be ready to talk steinmeier friday said the path was clear for the un security council to intervene in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program . the german foreign minister 's comments come a day after the eu released a draft announcement that talks with iran over its nuclear program had failed and that the bloc 's negotiating team was going to leave it up to the un security council to consider punitive action , official sources said friday . eu sees itself left with no choice the news of an official breakdown of talks would be confirmed early next week at a european foreign ministers meeting next tuesday .
the draft announcement said that the eu nations now believed that " iran 's continuation of enrichment-related activities has left the eu no choice , " but to throw the issue back to the un . bildunterschrift : the talks between the eu and iran will be suspended the ministers ' conclusions on iran , drawn up by the european union 's 25 member nations , expressed " deep concern " that iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as required by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog and a security council resolution . the french foreign ministry said friday a " broad agreement " existed between the six world powers engaged in the iran issue , the security council five plus germany , about un measures over iran 's nuclear program . " this means that there is no argument against letting the security council deal with the matter , " a spokesman for the ministry told reporters in paris .
" it 's clear that we are now going to work in new york -lrb- un -rrb- very soon , " said ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei . however the door to talks remains open , he added .
" to double-lock the door to negotiations is not our vision of things . " ministers meeting in luxembourg will signal end a european diplomat went further , saying that the eu foreign ministers will formally end negotiations with tehran over iran 's nuclear ambitions at their talks in luxembourg . the ministers are due to declare that " negotiations with iran have terminated because of a lack of results , " the diplomat said on condition of anonymity .
however , the draft of the meeting 's conclusions dating from october 11 does not include that sentence . senior diplomats from the six - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - discussed the sanctions during a videoconference wednesday morning , state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters .
" i think there is broad agreement on the potential sanctions that would be included , but not yet agreement on the specific items that would be in a resolution , that has to be worked out , " he said . threat of sanctions increases bildunterschrift : the security council will now discuss the iran crisis the six have been debating for weeks over the kinds of sanctions to slap on iran for ignoring an august 31 un deadline to suspend a uranium enrichment program that washington and others fear will be subverted to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons . under un security council article 41 , members may " decide what measures , not involving the use of armed force , are to be employed to give effect to its decisions . " these may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail , sea , air , postal , telegraphic , radio , and other means of communication , and the severance of diplomatic relations . but china and russia , which both wield veto power on the security council , have balked at imposing the kind of punitive measures sought by washington , with the backing of britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .
-lrb- 30.09.2006 -rrb- iran : eu nuke talks " step in the right direction " a sudden change of venue from paris to geneva failed to smooth over the discord at iran-eu nuclear talks .
despite positive comments , solutions remained distant .

" i am deeply honored to become the second asian to lead the organization , " ban told the general assembly after his nomination friday . " the true measure of success for the un is not how much we promise , but how much we deliver for those who need us most , " he said , adding : " the un is needed now more than ever before . " ban , a mild-mannered figure , has played key roles both as south korea 's foreign minister and earlier as seoul 's ambassador to the united nations in trying to resolve the long-standing north korean nuclear crisis . he outlined fighting poverty , hiv / aids , environmental degradation and protecting human rights friday as among the priorities of his tenure along with containing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and combating terrorism . the united nations body is under increasing pressure to reform , notably from its biggest financial backer and host the united states , but ban hinted that reforms would only come at an appropriate time . general secretary-elect pushes for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon will carry on with un reforms " we reform not to please others , but because we value what this organization stands for .
we reform because we believe in its future .
we can not change everything at once .
but if we choose wisely , and work together transparently , flexibly and honestly , progress in a few areas will lead to progress in a few more , " he added . the european union and united states led the congratulations , with us ambassador to the un john bolton saying : " we believe he is the right person to lead the united nations at this decisive moment in its history , particularly as the un struggles to fulfill the terms of the reform agenda that world leaders agreed to last fall . " president george w. bush welcomed the appointment , with the white house saying in a statement that ban assumes his role at a time of great challenge and opportunity at the united nations .
" we will rely on his leadership to help steer the un organization through the reforms already underway , and to propel the organization even further on the path of reform , " the white house stressed . ban recommended by security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush welcomed the appointment ban 's appointment was a mere formality after the powerful 15-member security council recommended him as annan 's successor on monday ; an event overshadowed by north korea declaring it had conducted a nuclear test . his election coincides with a major international crisis over north korea 's nuclear program and he somberly welcomed his nomination by the security council monday just after pyongyang 's nuclear announcement . " this should be a moment of joy .
but instead , i stand here with a very heavy heart , " he said . ban was the only remaining candidate in the race for the coveted , high-profile job after six other contenders withdrew . annan passes on the " impossible job " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan praised ban as a man with a " global mind " annan congratulated his successor , hailing him as " a man with a truly global mind " with " exceptional qualifications . " and he repeated the greeting made more than 50 years ago by the first un secretary general , norway 's trygve lie , to his swedish successor , dag hammarskjold : " you are about to take over the most impossible job on earth . " " while that may be true , i would add : this is also the best possible job on earth , " annan said . ban rose to prominence talking tough on north korean issues .
with 33 months in office , he is one of south korea 's longer-serving foreign ministers - surviving the sometimes turbulent diplomacy on the divided peninsula . ban will take up his post in january after 68-year-old annan steps down on december 31 after completing two five-year terms . other contenders for the job were indian diplomat shashi tharoor ; latvian president vaira vike-freiberga ; former thai deputy prime minister surakiart sathirathai ; jordan 's un ambassador prince zeid al-hussein ; sri lankan diplomat jayantha dhanapala and afghanistan 's former finance minister ashraf ghani . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ban has not developed visions " ban ki moon has been nominated to succeed kofi annan as secretary general of the united nations .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .

eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .
the second risk is that we start something ; we get entangled in a net of relationship .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .
the second risk is that we start something ; we get entangled in a net of relationship .
we never know what will come out of it .
finally , i 'd say that this risk is possible only with trust in other people .

" the first half was fantastic .
the team is playing consistently strong .
there has not been this level of performance over a long period of time for many years , " beckenbauer told the mass-market bild newspaper friday . the former soccer great , who also served as head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , said he was impressed with the german national side which since the world cup under new coach joachim löw has won all five of their games , scoring 23 goals while conceding just one . löw 's team tops world cup side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim löw is the mastermind behind the german team 's recent success " i 've seen even more improvement , " beckenbauer said .

" germany handily defeated slovakia 4-1 in bratislava on wednesday to continue the form they showed in reaching the world cup semi-finals and took a big step towards euro 2008 in austria and switzerland . " we ca n't speak yet of the european championship title .
that 's really too early with almost two years to go , " he said .

" last week , beckenbauer had told bild , " the football played by our national team is a lot stronger and is more enjoyable than that which is being played in the bundesliga . " the " kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known in germany , meanwhile said the hooligans who clashed with police in slovakia would not ruin the good reputation of german fans won at the world cup . however germany had to be careful it did not become " a hooligan nation " with " the hosts trembling when germany comes . " " these violent hordes are terrible , " he added .

since 1993 , she has made films on topics like identity , exclusion and gender roles . dw-world.de : why do you think that bollywood films have been so successful in germany ? bollywood is only one center of cinema .
india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .
but it is killing all other art expression .
either you are in mainstream , homogenized , bollywood - or you are out .
and that is a very big problem . so how diverse is indian film ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from dutta 's film " made in india " which explores visual arts in india india has many languages .
bollywood films are hindi cinema and there are many people in india who can not speak hindi , so they do n't watch bollywood .
they watch whatever is there native language in cinema , which are not ' big cinema ' so they do n't become internationally known .
bollywood makes films in what is recognized as national language in india - that is hindi .
which is in a way the government 's strategy to push hindi down everyone 's throat .
another problem is that a large number of people who are living abroad in europe and america , who we call nri : which means non-residential indian .
they have lived in other countries for generations , they do n't know what india is , but they have a concept of what india should be .
for bollywood , they are very important , because they can pay in hard currency . what are you perceptions of the treatment of female actors in bollywood films ? bildunterschrift : bollywood is described as patriachal and regressive in its portrayal of gender stereotypes bollywood is exactly like hollywood - it is extremely patriarchal and regressive film making .
you will rarely see female film makers who have their standing .
you will hardly see any films that are women-centric .
in feudal times , there was folk theater , which was full of music and song and actually bollywood is only a cinematic version of that .
it is not only regressive to women , but also to minorities , people who are obese , people with disabilities , it is regressive to anyone who does not speak hindi well . the international women 's film festival in cologne and dortmund ends on sunday .
with a focus on iran and india , about 120 films from 32 countries were shown . rachel ryan interviewed madusree dutta send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

even as religious groups try to reign in commercialization of the holiday , christmas remains a hot item abroad . more than two months before the big day , the german christmas industry has unwrapped the tinsel and colored lights .
seem a little early ?
in germany , christmas trading normally gets underway in september .
the 2006 christmas decoration catalogues shipped last month and grocery store shelves have sported christmas cookies for nearly as long . this weekend , a massive christmas trade fair brings the commercial side of christmas to the masses in hanover . " the selling started here in germany at the end of september , " said alexandra jaspert , a spokeswoman for the christmas trade fair in hanover . the hanover fair will have 150 vendors selling every type of christmas-related bauble , food and fashion imaginable .
whatever is new and trendy for christmas 2006 can be found there .
for germans , that means decking the christmas tree in patriotic yellow-red-black this year .

" we 're pretty early this year but when all the christmas markets start it 's too late for us because all our exhibitors will be there , " jaspert said . going international bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hand-made ornaments are popular export items german christmas - with it 's tradition of hand-made craftsmanship - went international decades ago .

the wohlfahrt family got its start in the 1960s selling german christmas tradition , like music boxes from the famous crafts-producing erzgebirge region , at bazaars held on us military bases . the german company krebs glas lauscha , which makes glass ornaments , expanded to the us in the 1970s with christmas by krebs .
they have an office in new mexico and a showroom in dallas , texas . us households spent an estimated $ 6.5 billion -lrb- 5.18 billion euros -rrb- on christmas-related decorations in 2005 .

while 80 percent of germans do not want to start seeing christmas cookies and chocolate santa clauses for sale in october , according to the evangelical lutheran group , only 45 percent wait for advent to buy christmas products in the supermarkets . margot kässmann , the bishop for the evangelical lutheran church in hanover , encourages christians to make a political statement with their shopping baskets .

the team is playing consistently strong .
there has not been this level of performance over a long period of time for many years , " beckenbauer told the mass-market bild newspaper friday . the former soccer great , who also served as head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , said he was impressed with the german national side which since the world cup under new coach joachim löw has won all five of their games , scoring 23 goals while conceding just one . löw 's team tops world cup side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim löw is the mastermind behind the german team 's recent success " i 've seen even more improvement , " beckenbauer said .

" last week , beckenbauer had told bild , " the football played by our national team is a lot stronger and is more enjoyable than that which is being played in the bundesliga . " the " kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known in germany , meanwhile said the hooligans who clashed with police in slovakia would not ruin the good reputation of german fans won at the world cup . however germany had to be careful it did not become " a hooligan nation " with " the hosts trembling when germany comes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 14.10.2006 " bollywood is killing other indian cinema " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood 's far from being representative of india , dutta says dw-world.de spoke with indian film director madusree dutta at the women 's international film festival in cologne about indian film and its significance beyond bollywood . indian director madusree dutta has been described as one of the most successful female documentary filmmaker in india .
since 1993 , she has made films on topics like identity , exclusion and gender roles . dw-world.de : why do you think that bollywood films have been so successful in germany ? bollywood is only one center of cinema .
india also has many other centers of cinema but bollywood has international recognition , which has only happened in the last 10 years and is practically killing all other cinema .
why bollywood is successful internationally is also something that bothers me .
i think what is happening , is that when western europe discovered bollywood , they thought it was a sub-culture .
they thought this is one cinema that was away from hollywood , but equally popular - if not more popular - in the whole south of the world .
but it is killing all other art expression .
either you are in mainstream , homogenized , bollywood - or you are out .
and that is a very big problem . so how diverse is indian film ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from dutta 's film " made in india " which explores visual arts in india india has many languages .
bollywood films are hindi cinema and there are many people in india who can not speak hindi , so they do n't watch bollywood .
they watch whatever is there native language in cinema , which are not ' big cinema ' so they do n't become internationally known .
bollywood makes films in what is recognized as national language in india - that is hindi .
which is in a way the government 's strategy to push hindi down everyone 's throat .
another problem is that a large number of people who are living abroad in europe and america , who we call nri : which means non-residential indian .
they have lived in other countries for generations , they do n't know what india is , but they have a concept of what india should be .
for bollywood , they are very important , because they can pay in hard currency . what are you perceptions of the treatment of female actors in bollywood films ? bildunterschrift : bollywood is described as patriachal and regressive in its portrayal of gender stereotypes bollywood is exactly like hollywood - it is extremely patriarchal and regressive film making .
you will rarely see female film makers who have their standing .
you will hardly see any films that are women-centric .
in feudal times , there was folk theater , which was full of music and song and actually bollywood is only a cinematic version of that .
it is not only regressive to women , but also to minorities , people who are obese , people with disabilities , it is regressive to anyone who does not speak hindi well . the international women 's film festival in cologne and dortmund ends on sunday .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .
she worked for the german zionist organization and researched anti-semitic propaganda .
in the summer of 1933 , she was arrested , but subsequently released . an intellectual in exile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt 's affair with heidegger has inspired volumes arendt did n't like to be described as a philosopher because her work centered on the fact that " men , not man , live on earth and inhabit the world . "
although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .
she wrote for various journals - including jewish forntier and aufbau -lrb- reconstruction -rrb- , worked as a lecturer and became active in the german-jewish community . her epochal work , " the origins of totalitarianism , " appeared in 1951 , followed by several other books , including " vita activa , " a theory of political action , and " of revolution , " in which she discussed radical political changes . the banality of evil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court in 1961 in 1963 , arendt published " eichmann in jerusalem , " her account of the trial of nazi criminal adolf eichmann .
eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .
4 , 1975 .
she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .
" one exposes oneself in public as a person .
the second risk is that we start something ; we get entangled in a net of relationship .
we never know what will come out of it .
finally , i 'd say that this risk is possible only with trust in other people .

" the first half was fantastic .
the team is playing consistently strong .
there has not been this level of performance over a long period of time for many years , " beckenbauer told the mass-market bild newspaper friday . the former soccer great , who also served as head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , said he was impressed with the german national side which since the world cup under new coach joachim löw has won all five of their games , scoring 23 goals while conceding just one . löw 's team tops world cup side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim löw is the mastermind behind the german team 's recent success " i 've seen even more improvement , " beckenbauer said .
" at the world cup you could feel the determination to win .
now a lightness has come to it as well . " germany handily defeated slovakia 4-1 in bratislava on wednesday to continue the form they showed in reaching the world cup semi-finals and took a big step towards euro 2008 in austria and switzerland . " we ca n't speak yet of the european championship title .
that 's really too early with almost two years to go , " he said .
" but when i see how other big nations are stumbling through the qualifications we are at the moment miles ahead .

" last week , beckenbauer had told bild , " the football played by our national team is a lot stronger and is more enjoyable than that which is being played in the bundesliga . " the " kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known in germany , meanwhile said the hooligans who clashed with police in slovakia would not ruin the good reputation of german fans won at the world cup . however germany had to be careful it did not become " a hooligan nation " with " the hosts trembling when germany comes . " " these violent hordes are terrible , " he added .
" i can only hope that they will be completely stopped before the next away game and do n't appear again in the stadiums .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .

historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .

a german attorney has developed a new computer system he hopes will help bring international war criminals to justice more quickly and efficiently . prosecuting criminals for war crimes or genocide requires a complex number of laws that can baffle even the most experienced prosecutor . that 's where case matrix comes in .
the software helps prosecutors manage large , international trials and keeps them from dragging on indefinitely . klaus rackwitz , a lawyer and administrator at the international criminal court in den haag , developed the software .
while not yet in widespread use , he hopes his system will help investigators bring order to the thousands of pieces of evidence they deal with each day .
the program also contains information about actual case law and important law texts .
complex case facts are simplified . " the system has been designed so it can be used in all national and international courts , " rackwitz said . international crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring during the nuremberg war crimes trial for the most part , a world-wide legal standard exists for criminal offenses like genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , rackwitz said .
his software sees to it that everyone knows and understands these common standards . international law is a relatively young legal discipline .
historically , very few examples exist .
the nuremberg trials , the tokyo war crimes tribunal and the recent ad-hoc tribunals in yugoslavia and rwanda are the most well-known examples . in the case of rwanda , a coordinated and simplified international approach would have greatly helped with the investigation into the torture and genocide there .
information technology can help make corresponding case law clearer and more coherent . keeping perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bringing war criminals to justice can take years case matrix also helps keep users from getting bogged down in thousands of small documents and maintain perspective of the case , rackwitz said . " we catalogue the case law , develop it , make catchwords available , " he said .
" the system should help the user … not lose the overview under the hundreds or thousands of documents .
and afterwards , should help to order and present the facts . " right now the system is internet-based .

" the first half was fantastic .
the team is playing consistently strong .
there has not been this level of performance over a long period of time for many years , " beckenbauer told the mass-market bild newspaper friday . the former soccer great , who also served as head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , said he was impressed with the german national side which since the world cup under new coach joachim löw has won all five of their games , scoring 23 goals while conceding just one . löw 's team tops world cup side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim löw is the mastermind behind the german team 's recent success " i 've seen even more improvement , " beckenbauer said .
" at the world cup you could feel the determination to win .
now a lightness has come to it as well . " germany handily defeated slovakia 4-1 in bratislava on wednesday to continue the form they showed in reaching the world cup semi-finals and took a big step towards euro 2008 in austria and switzerland . " we ca n't speak yet of the european championship title .
that 's really too early with almost two years to go , " he said .
" but when i see how other big nations are stumbling through the qualifications we are at the moment miles ahead . " . the statement was directed at world cup winners italy , runners-up france and england , who have all dropped points in their euro 2008 campaigns . national teams stars faltering in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has had less to celebrate with bayern munich , where he warms the bench beckenbauer added it was noticeable that the leading bundesliga clubs appeared to be struggling while the national team was playing so well . two bayern munich players , lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger , have shone playing for germany , but podolski is struggling to claim a first-team place at bayern while schweinsteiger 's club form has been patchy . beckenbauer said he would like to see schweinsteiger play as well for bayern where he seemed " much more inhibited . " last week , beckenbauer had told bild , " the football played by our national team is a lot stronger and is more enjoyable than that which is being played in the bundesliga . " the " kaiser , " as beckenbauer is known in germany , meanwhile said the hooligans who clashed with police in slovakia would not ruin the good reputation of german fans won at the world cup . however germany had to be careful it did not become " a hooligan nation " with " the hosts trembling when germany comes . " " these violent hordes are terrible , " he added .

" i am deeply honored to become the second asian to lead the organization , " ban told the general assembly after his nomination friday . " the true measure of success for the un is not how much we promise , but how much we deliver for those who need us most , " he said , adding : " the un is needed now more than ever before . " ban , a mild-mannered figure , has played key roles both as south korea 's foreign minister and earlier as seoul 's ambassador to the united nations in trying to resolve the long-standing north korean nuclear crisis . he outlined fighting poverty , hiv / aids , environmental degradation and protecting human rights friday as among the priorities of his tenure along with containing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and combating terrorism . the united nations body is under increasing pressure to reform , notably from its biggest financial backer and host the united states , but ban hinted that reforms would only come at an appropriate time . general secretary-elect pushes for reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon will carry on with un reforms " we reform not to please others , but because we value what this organization stands for .
we reform because we believe in its future .
we can not change everything at once .
but if we choose wisely , and work together transparently , flexibly and honestly , progress in a few areas will lead to progress in a few more , " he added . the european union and united states led the congratulations , with us ambassador to the un john bolton saying : " we believe he is the right person to lead the united nations at this decisive moment in its history , particularly as the un struggles to fulfill the terms of the reform agenda that world leaders agreed to last fall . " president george w. bush welcomed the appointment , with the white house saying in a statement that ban assumes his role at a time of great challenge and opportunity at the united nations .
" we will rely on his leadership to help steer the un organization through the reforms already underway , and to propel the organization even further on the path of reform , " the white house stressed . ban recommended by security council bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush welcomed the appointment ban 's appointment was a mere formality after the powerful 15-member security council recommended him as annan 's successor on monday ; an event overshadowed by north korea declaring it had conducted a nuclear test . his election coincides with a major international crisis over north korea 's nuclear program and he somberly welcomed his nomination by the security council monday just after pyongyang 's nuclear announcement . " this should be a moment of joy .
but instead , i stand here with a very heavy heart , " he said . ban was the only remaining candidate in the race for the coveted , high-profile job after six other contenders withdrew . annan passes on the " impossible job " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan praised ban as a man with a " global mind " annan congratulated his successor , hailing him as " a man with a truly global mind " with " exceptional qualifications . " and he repeated the greeting made more than 50 years ago by the first un secretary general , norway 's trygve lie , to his swedish successor , dag hammarskjold : " you are about to take over the most impossible job on earth .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .

although no stranger to sweeping historical generalizations , arendt was less interested in grand philosophical schemas than in the ways in which individual destinies interact with universal principles . in 1933 , arendt fled to paris .
there she met her future husband , philosopher heinrich blücher .
together , blücher and arendt emigrated to the us in 1941 . arendt 's career took off in new york .

eichmann was one of the chief executioners of hitler 's " final solution " for the extermination of the jewish people .
he had been captured by israeli agents in argentina and put on trial in israel . the book and arendt 's theory of the banality of evil provoked a firestorm of controversy with some critics saw as an attempt at downplaying the nazi crimes and the suffering of the jews . " people hold one thing against me , namely that i can still laugh , " arendts said .
" and , in a way , i can understand it .
but i really always thought that eichmann was a clown .
i have read the 3,600 pages of his police interrogation and i did it very closely .
and i do n't know how many times i laughed out loud !
people hold this against me . " according to arendt , evil does not originate out of hatred or perverse pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering .
evil , arendt argued , is essentially banal .
it emerges out of the absence of the imaginative capacities that make the human and moral dimensions of our activities tangible . not even sinister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arendt was one of the most influential political theorists of the 20th century arendt was convinced that eichmann - " the man in the glass booth " whom she described as being " not even sinister " - failed to exercise his capacity for thinking and judgement , which resulted in his inability to imagine himself in the role of his victims .
arendt could n't see any traces of the demonic wrongdoing or deviant sadism in the man who organized the transport of the jews to the death camps .
instead , she painted the picture of a petty bureaucrat who followed his orders , unthinkingly but efficiently . " the deeds were monstrous , but the doer ... was quite ordinary , commonplace , and neither demonic nor monstrous , " arendt wrote . arendt died on dec .

she never stopped believing in the possibility of political action in a shared public world based on the relations of reciprocity and solidarity . " the risk of going public seems clear to me , " she wrote .

oct .
14 marks the 100th anniversary of her birth . in her work , hannah arendt grappled not only with the nature of totalitarian power and banality of evil , but also with the possibility of individual political action . " when you are attacked as a jew , you have to defend yourself as a jew , " arendt said in a 1964 television interview .
" not as a german or a citizen of the world , but very concretely .
what can i do ? " hannah arendt was born in 1906 in hanover .
she studied philosophy in marburg with martin heidegger , one of the most famous and most controversial german philosophers of the 20th century .
the unusually gifted student and her married professor had a brief and difficult love affair .
eventually , arendt left marburg for heidelberg and finished her dissertation with another renowned phenomenologist , karl jaspers , in 1928 . after heidegger became the first national socialist rector of the university of freiburg , arendt - who after the war testified on heidegger 's behalf before a denazification committee - turned to political activism .

they are also more likely to discuss the decision with the patient and their relatives and other medical colleagues .
the research will be published in the palliative medicine journal . "

compared with the other countries , uk doctors were more open with colleagues and were likely to discuss " end-of-life issues " .
but they were more cautious about taking decisions that significantly shorten life .

former philosophy professor abimael guzman led a 12-year rebellion in which around 70,000 people died .
abimael guzman was tried after his capture in 1992 by a secret military court , but the verdict and life sentence were thrown out in 2003 .
guzman 's partner elena iparraguirre was also found guilty and given life .
the verdicts took several hours to read , and guzman stood motionless with his arms folded as the court gave its judgement .
ten other co-defendants were given sentences of between 24 and 35 years .
' machetes ' the shining path , a maoist guerrilla group , waged a violent campaign to overthrow the peruvian state .
i am a revolutionary combatant and totally reject being a terrorist abimael guzman profile : shining path the killings of lucanamarca in 2003 , a truth and reconciliation commission blamed more than 31,000 killings on the guerrillas .
survivors from a shining path massacre in the andean village of lucanamarca , where 69 peasants were shot and hacked to death as a reprisal , gathered outside the court to demand maximum sentences for the defendants .
" they killed them with machetes , stones , axes - and for those who did not die in agony in this way , they even put them into a vat of boiling water , " ignacio tacas , a 35-year-old farmer from the village , told the associated press news agency .
the shining path founder said the massacre had been a response to " reactionary military action " .
the insurgency provoked a state backlash by the government of former president alberto fujimori which was blamed for tens of thousands more deaths .
fujimori is currently in exile in chile facing extradition to peru , where prosecutors have been pursuing him on charges relating to corruption in office and human rights violation during the shining path crackdown .
communist slogans guzman 's first trial , by a secret military court , was ruled unfair by peru 's constitutional court in 2003 .
his first re-trial in 2004 ended in chaos after he shouted communist slogans in his defence in front of live television cameras .
to avoid a repeat performance , tape recorders and cameras were banned from the courtroom for this trial .
however , television stations were allowed to use footage from the court 's closed-circuit television cameras to broadcast guzman 's sentence live on friday .
the year-long hearing was held at the high-security naval base where guzman has been held since 1993 .
at the start of the trial , guzman had described himself as a " revolutionary combatant " and not a terrorist .
his lawyer manuel fajardo had argued his client should be granted an amnesty because of violations against his right to due process .
he told the associated press that the verdict had been based not " strictly on the law , but rather on politics " , and said that the deaths had been an inevitable result of the war between the shining path and the peruvian government .
mr fajardo said they would be appealing against the verdict .
a few hundred shining path rebels are still operative in the country 's south and south-east , but a bbc correspondent in lima says they now pose little threat .

the year-long hearing was held at the high-security naval base where guzman has been held since 1993 .
at the start of the trial , guzman had described himself as a " revolutionary combatant " and not a terrorist .
his lawyer manuel fajardo had argued his client should be granted an amnesty because of violations against his right to due process .
he told the associated press that the verdict had been based not " strictly on the law , but rather on politics " , and said that the deaths had been an inevitable result of the war between the shining path and the peruvian government .
mr fajardo said they would be appealing against the verdict .
a few hundred shining path rebels are still operative in the country 's south and south-east , but a bbc correspondent in lima says they now pose little threat .

former philosophy professor abimael guzman led a 12-year rebellion in which around 70,000 people died .
abimael guzman was tried after his capture in 1992 by a secret military court , but the verdict and life sentence were thrown out in 2003 .
guzman 's partner elena iparraguirre was also found guilty and given life .
the verdicts took several hours to read , and guzman stood motionless with his arms folded as the court gave its judgement .
ten other co-defendants were given sentences of between 24 and 35 years .
' machetes ' the shining path , a maoist guerrilla group , waged a violent campaign to overthrow the peruvian state .
i am a revolutionary combatant and totally reject being a terrorist abimael guzman profile : shining path the killings of lucanamarca in 2003 , a truth and reconciliation commission blamed more than 31,000 killings on the guerrillas .
survivors from a shining path massacre in the andean village of lucanamarca , where 69 peasants were shot and hacked to death as a reprisal , gathered outside the court to demand maximum sentences for the defendants .
" they killed them with machetes , stones , axes - and for those who did not die in agony in this way , they even put them into a vat of boiling water , " ignacio tacas , a 35-year-old farmer from the village , told the associated press news agency .
the shining path founder said the massacre had been a response to " reactionary military action " .
the insurgency provoked a state backlash by the government of former president alberto fujimori which was blamed for tens of thousands more deaths .
fujimori is currently in exile in chile facing extradition to peru , where prosecutors have been pursuing him on charges relating to corruption in office and human rights violation during the shining path crackdown .
communist slogans guzman 's first trial , by a secret military court , was ruled unfair by peru 's constitutional court in 2003 .
his first re-trial in 2004 ended in chaos after he shouted communist slogans in his defence in front of live television cameras .
to avoid a repeat performance , tape recorders and cameras were banned from the courtroom for this trial .
however , television stations were allowed to use footage from the court 's closed-circuit television cameras to broadcast guzman 's sentence live on friday .
