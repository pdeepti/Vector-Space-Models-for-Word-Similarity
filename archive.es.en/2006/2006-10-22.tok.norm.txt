the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , jihad faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor . closer scrutiny of foreign students according to a magazine report on the weekend , germany plans to tighten vetting procedures for foreign students as a consequence of a failed attacks . the weekly der spiegel said persons who stand as guarantors for students in their visa applications would be checked out in future in addition to the students themselves and their sponsors . the duration of residence permits would be cut by half to at least one year and the students would have to report regularly to local government offices , the magazine said in a report released in advance of publication monday . uli hummel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german muslim groups condemn train bombing plot germany 's muslim community on friday condemned the failed plot to blow up passengers trains in the west of the country last month and offered to help authorities fight terrorism .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , jihad faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor . closer scrutiny of foreign students according to a magazine report on the weekend , germany plans to tighten vetting procedures for foreign students as a consequence of a failed attacks . the weekly der spiegel said persons who stand as guarantors for students in their visa applications would be checked out in future in addition to the students themselves and their sponsors . the duration of residence permits would be cut by half to at least one year and the students would have to report regularly to local government offices , the magazine said in a report released in advance of publication monday . uli hummel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german muslim groups condemn train bombing plot germany 's muslim community on friday condemned the failed plot to blow up passengers trains in the west of the country last month and offered to help authorities fight terrorism .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.10.2006 suspects in attempted bombings face prison for life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad hamad -lrb- left -rrb- and youssef mohamad el hajdib built faulty bombs on july 31 , suspected terrorists presumably intended to cause a bloodbath on two german regional trains .
the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american .

" if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .

he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.10.2006 in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder says he felt uneasy with the role religious faith took in bush 's decision-making ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .
schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , jihad faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor . closer scrutiny of foreign students according to a magazine report on the weekend , germany plans to tighten vetting procedures for foreign students as a consequence of a failed attacks . the weekly der spiegel said persons who stand as guarantors for students in their visa applications would be checked out in future in addition to the students themselves and their sponsors . the duration of residence permits would be cut by half to at least one year and the students would have to report regularly to local government offices , the magazine said in a report released in advance of publication monday . uli hummel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german muslim groups condemn train bombing plot germany 's muslim community on friday condemned the failed plot to blow up passengers trains in the west of the country last month and offered to help authorities fight terrorism .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 22.10.2006 schumi-town honors favorite son ’ s final fling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher at the award ceremony of the formula one chinese grand prix - the driver has become very accustomed to this pose michael schumacher brought the checkered flag down on his record-breaking career sunday .
a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 22.10.2006 schumi-town honors favorite son ’ s final fling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher at the award ceremony of the formula one chinese grand prix - the driver has become very accustomed to this pose michael schumacher brought the checkered flag down on his record-breaking career sunday .
a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .
it helps expellees explore their past and reach a sense of inner peace .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?

“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .

the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father .

" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , jihad faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor . closer scrutiny of foreign students according to a magazine report on the weekend , germany plans to tighten vetting procedures for foreign students as a consequence of a failed attacks . the weekly der spiegel said persons who stand as guarantors for students in their visa applications would be checked out in future in addition to the students themselves and their sponsors . the duration of residence permits would be cut by half to at least one year and the students would have to report regularly to local government offices , the magazine said in a report released in advance of publication monday . uli hummel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german muslim groups condemn train bombing plot germany 's muslim community on friday condemned the failed plot to blow up passengers trains in the west of the country last month and offered to help authorities fight terrorism .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .
it helps expellees explore their past and reach a sense of inner peace .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.10.2006 suspects in attempted bombings face prison for life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad hamad -lrb- left -rrb- and youssef mohamad el hajdib built faulty bombs on july 31 , suspected terrorists presumably intended to cause a bloodbath on two german regional trains .
the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

the two lebanese men now face life-long imprisonment .
germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation . " i have no idea what happened in germany , " he said .
" all i know is that german authorities are investigating my son 's involvement in the attempted bombings .
i would bet my life on his innocence . " shahid said that his son is merely a student and not a fundamentalist .
he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .
employment is high in the city , and prospects for young people in lebanon are not promising .
shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .
" you only have to make a one-time security deposit of 7,200 euros -lrb- $ 9,000 -rrb- , and your son can work as he studies in germany , " the uncle told jihad 's father . " my son was content " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrong kind of headlines : jihad as a criminal suspect at large jihad 's mother , bouchra jaber , likewise can not believe that her son was involved in the bombing plot . " my son was very happy staying with his uncle in essen , " she said .
" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , jihad faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor . closer scrutiny of foreign students according to a magazine report on the weekend , germany plans to tighten vetting procedures for foreign students as a consequence of a failed attacks . the weekly der spiegel said persons who stand as guarantors for students in their visa applications would be checked out in future in addition to the students themselves and their sponsors . the duration of residence permits would be cut by half to at least one year and the students would have to report regularly to local government offices , the magazine said in a report released in advance of publication monday . uli hummel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german muslim groups condemn train bombing plot germany 's muslim community on friday condemned the failed plot to blow up passengers trains in the west of the country last month and offered to help authorities fight terrorism .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

" schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .

we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?

“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .

tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .

they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .
it helps expellees explore their past and reach a sense of inner peace .

a man who divides opinion like few others , schumi ’ s last race stirred mixed feelings in the people of his home town of kerpen . the german town of kerpen to the west of the city of cologne is much like any rural settlement on the periphery of a larger metropolis .
and like many in germany , it has seen the boom times come and go ; in kerpen ’ s case , the former mining community is now surrounded by commercial estates supporting the town ’ s logistics industry . but one only has to walk through kerpen and out into its outlying suburbs to notice that this town has one thing that sets it apart from the others .
that one thing is michael schumacher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the michael schumacher kart center in kerpen in other towns , the mostly unattractive surroundings would blend anonymously into the gloom of a damp and dark october day but in kerpen , many homes and shops glow like beacons .
the heart of italian motor sport may be based just over a thousand kilometers away in maranello but one gets the feeling even the home town of ferrari would be hard pressed to show more support .
even on non-race days , the colors of schumacher ’ s team adorn the windows of homes and store fronts . but while sunday oct .
22 will be a race day , it will be no ordinary race day .
kerpen ’ s record-breaking world champion will race for the final time in formula one and to mark schumi ’ s retirement , the locals are literally going to paint the town red . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phenomenal success - has it gone to his head ?
“ michael has put kerpen on the world map , ” says eva berger at the town ’ s information center .
“ motor racing is usually a sport for the rich but the schumacher ’ s were not affluent .
the whole family worked hard to give michael the chance to use his talents and got help from those with money who could see his special gift .
we ’ re very proud of him . ” “ he was such an unassuming young boy but very focused , ” says britta heine , a storekeeper whose shopfront is already decked out with ferrari 's black stallion logo and portraits of kerpen ’ s most famous son two days before schumacher ’ s 250th and final race .
“ some around here thought he was rude but i think his mind was just always occupied with winning . ” arrogant and aloof ? the bricklayer ’ s son , born just down the road in hürth-hermülheim on january 3 , 1969 , has often been accused of arrogance and aloofness during his remarkable career .
and while the majority of the townsfolk will attend the massive party at kerpen ’ s town hall sunday to celebrate the statistically greatest driver of all time , there are some who will not . “ i agree with mayor -lrb- marlies -rrb- sieburg , ” says taxi driver bernd kässler .
“ schumacher has done little for this town .
his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

his brother -lrb- fellow driver ralf -rrb- has given something back but micha has just taken it all and hidden it away in his mansion in switzerland , ” he said , referring to a statement made earlier this week in which kerpen ’ s mayor suggested some citizens would prefer michael to follow ralf ’ s example and show more of a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics say despite all his success , schumacher has given little back to his hometown there are those within motor sport who believe that schumacher has gained greatness through his achievements but will ultimately fail in becoming a legend like alain prost or ayrton senna due to a lack of humility and humanity . some of his rivals and critics have accused him of being excessively ruthless and unsportsmanlike on the track ; others describe him as cold and robotic , a man with a single vision who would forsake everything to achieve his goal . the visitors and staff at the go-karting track - at which michael ’ s father rolf worked as a mechanic before later becoming part of the executive management team - would disagree . giving back the renamed the michael schumacher kart and event center , with its impressive outdoor and indoor tracks , corporate hospitality business and public museum , attracts thousands of tourists and motor racing fans every year and provides the potential schumis of the future with the opportunity to hone their skills on karts much as michael and ralf did . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to his roots at the go-kart center “ seven world championships , the records for race victories , fastest laps , pole positions , and most races won in a single season ?
is creating such a legacy not giving something back to kerpen ? ” asked fan karl rüttger .
“ when people look back on the greatest racer of all time , do you think they will ignore where he came from in that story ? ” “ what is there not to be proud of ? ” asked evelina marini , a visiting ferrari fanatic from the home of the cavallino rampante -lrb- the prancing horse on the car maker ’ s shield -rrb- .
“ schumacher has eclipsed all others in his sport and he is what the germans call the schwiegermutters liebling -lrb- mother in law 's favorite -rrb- , a scandal-free family man .
it is kerpen which should be doing more for him . ” and the town seems willing to oblige .
schumacher already has a street named after him and in november , kerpen will celebrate the inaugural michael schumacher day , the first of what the town council hope will become an annual celebration of the man who put kerpen on the map . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de michael schumacher wins german grand prix michael schumacher boosted his chances of snatching an eighth world title when he won the german grand prix for the fourth time with a faultless performance here on sunday .

germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .
his parents live in al-kobbe , one the city quarters of tripoli - lebanon 's second largest city - which has been ravaged by war and poverty . disbelief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad 's parents are at a loss over their son shahid hamad , jihad hamad 's father , can not grasp his 20-year-old son 's situation .

germany plans to increase its scrutiny of foreign students . the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases filled with bombs on the trains .
had there not been a mistake in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the planned explosions near hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people and put it on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london subways and buses in july 2005 . investigators traced the two suspects back to lebanon . one of the two men accused of the bomb attempts , jihad hamad , is currently being held in custody in beirut .

he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one . jihad hamad 's parents live modestly - like many of tripoli 's residents .

shahid decided to send his son to germany to offer him better opportunities .
he and his wife expected him to study in germany and marry a german woman . jihad 's uncle lives in essen , and encouraged him to study here .

" we talked to each other on the phone every few days and he told me everything down to the last detail - where he shopped and ate , where he went . " jihad hamad suddenly turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance in tripoli by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the recent war . he and his parents ended up arguing intensely since jihad 's parents felt that , despite their modest means , they had invested considerable money to enable their son to study in germany . jihad promptly left his parents ' house and hid at a neighbor 's . incriminating evidence investigations were meanwhile underway in germany .
on august 19 , just days before jihad 's arrest , his presumed accomplice , youssef mohamad el hajdib , was arrested at kiel 's central train station , and handed over to lebanese authorities a short time later following incriminating dna tests . 21-year-old el hajdib apparently lived with jihad in a cologne apartment just weeks before the attempted bombings . searches of the apartment turned up damning evidence , including both dna that matched that on the suitcases , as well as receipts for the gas canisters and gas used in the failed bomb plot .
images from surveillance cameras also showed jihad carrying baggage onto the train at the cologne train station . partial admission of guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police found evidence in this cologne apartment building jihad has meanwhile given a partial confession to lebanese authorities that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains , without being aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and el hajdib researched on the internet about various bomb materials that could have increased victims ' suffering in the planned attacks . yet despite all the evidence and jihad 's partial admission of guilt , his parents still believe in his innocence .
his mother called him a " loving " person . she is desperate and accusative .
" i sent my child to germany .
the germans should have taken care of him , " she said .
" if he ended up getting involved with extremists and they indoctrinated him , then the germans are responsible for that . " at the beginning of september , the head of the federal criminal police office , jörg zierke , said the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammad in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef mohamad el hajdib to devise their plot . lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , jihad faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor . closer scrutiny of foreign students according to a magazine report on the weekend , germany plans to tighten vetting procedures for foreign students as a consequence of a failed attacks . the weekly der spiegel said persons who stand as guarantors for students in their visa applications would be checked out in future in addition to the students themselves and their sponsors . the duration of residence permits would be cut by half to at least one year and the students would have to report regularly to local government offices , the magazine said in a report released in advance of publication monday . uli hummel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german muslim groups condemn train bombing plot germany 's muslim community on friday condemned the failed plot to blow up passengers trains in the west of the country last month and offered to help authorities fight terrorism .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .
it helps expellees explore their past and reach a sense of inner peace .

schröder had few kind words for his own successor . although during much of gerhard schröder 's seven-year term in office , media reports focused on his frosty relationship with the us president , schröder himself has said in interviews leading up to this thursday 's release of his memoirs that his experience with the us leader were not all unpleasant , although the two men did not see eye-to-eye on many issues . " there were some very pleasant meetings with the american president despite our diverging views .
bush is a thoroughly engaging and open discussion partner , " schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's memoirs are coming out this thursday the war , bush 's use of prayer in his approach to the conflict , and his own decisions to call early elections are discussed by schröder in his forthcoming memoirs entitled " decisions : my life in politics , " which are due to be published in germany on thursday . schröder , who served as chancellor from 1998 to 2005 , was a strong opponent of the us-led war on iraq and refused to provide military assistance in the venture .
the issue drove german-us relations to a new post-world war two low . but in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel , which is publishing excerpts from the 544-page book , the former chancellor described himself as " anything but anti-american . " schröder , who led his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to power in 1998 , describes how he had tears in his eyes as he watched the events of sept .
11 , 2001 unfold on television . " it was important to me that germany fulfill its requirements as an ally , " he wrote . troubled by religiosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were some laughs between the two but while schröder and bush 's initial meetings were friendly , in the end the german leader could not accept the fact that religion seemed to be the driving force in the us president 's political decisions . " if a person adopts a political policy based on what he gleans from his prayers , in other words a personal talk with god , it can lead to difficulties in a democracy , " schröder told the newspaper . the age of enlightenment in the 18th century led to a separation of church and state powers " from political action based on individual beliefs , " he said .
he wrote that some elements in the united states are hypocritical regarding secularism and government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religion is seen by some to play too large a role in us politics " we rightly criticize that in most islamic states , the role of religion for society and the character of the rule of law are not clearly separated , " schröder wrote .
" but we fail to recognize that in the usa , the christian fundamentalists and their interpretation of the bible have similar tendencies . " relations between the two countries improved after schröder 's election defeat last year , which led to chancellor angela merkel taking over as head of government . early elections for the first time , schröder addressed openly why he called for early elections in 2005 , one year before they were scheduled .
he said if he had not done so after a lost election in the one-time spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , " relevant powers " in the spd would have demanded that he give up his course of labor market and welfare reforms . " then i would have had to resign , " he said in der spiegel , adding that such an event would have been a " catastrophe " for the party " because it would have been clear that the spd had forced its own chancellor to step down . " criticism of merkel schröder accused the current chancellor of displaying weak leadership and of making " basic errors " ' since she took charge of a grand coalition with the ex-chancellor 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder during a televised debate " there 's a world of difference betweeen being in the opposition and explaining how things should be done to actually running the world 's third biggest economic power , adopting foreign policy positions and carrying out far-reaching domestic reforms , " he said . schröder said merkel needed a firmer hand to deal with the political infighting that has dogged the coalition and her own christian democrat / christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- alliance . a csu spokesman on sunday accused schröder of " putting the boot in . " " it 's a cheap way of trying to cash in by someone who has not been able to digest his loss to angela merkel and his rejection by his own political party , " the spokesman said . schröder 's book is to be released on thursday at the spd headquarters in berlin .

with warsaw convinced that germany wants to brush its wartime atrocities under the carpet by portraying itself as a victim , the issue has long been a strain on german-polish relations . now a group of students at viadrina university on the german-polish border are doing their bit to cool down those simmering hostilities . by organizing individual trips for german expellees to western poland , they hope to shift the focus from the political to the personal . shocking stories albert beil from wiesbaden was one of their early clients . after hearing about the project , he and his three brothers and sisters went with a personal tour guide to the former forestry office in lemritz - which used to be german neumark before it was transferred to poland in 1945 - where his grandfather worked until he was deported at the end of the war . " the family of foresters who live there now gave us a very warm welcome , " he said .
" we looked at old photographs and talked about the past .
i was shocked to hear about what happened to this polish family .
they were forced to flee from lemberg in what 's now the ukraine .
the germans were expelled from what is today western poland , but then the same fate awaited the next people who came . " improved understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-polish relations are fraught albert beil 's visit was planned by mateusz hartwig , a 27-year-old polish phd student at viadrina university .
it was he who contacted the polish family and asked if they would be willing to receive a visit from albert beil . hartwig teamed up with another eleven students one year ago to set up the german-polish service in order to help people find out more about their personal histories .
they hope the initiative might bring about improved understanding of the thorny issue of expellees . " we at viadrina university wanted to illustrate the personal aspect to history , " said hartwig .
" what we do is set up meetings with eyewitnesses which allow people to talk on a very individual , human level about the expulsions and how people picked up the threads of their lives . " cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , lemberg is called lvov so far , fourteen individually tailored trips have been organized , all customized to the personal interests of the travelers .
respective sensitivities are such that setting up appointments can be a cultural minefield .
tour guides are expected to be fluent in both german and polish and to specialize in particular regions . juliane tomann from dresden is an expert on silesia , from where her grandfather was expelled after the war . " i talked to him a lot when we were developing the project , and he told me a lot about his experiences , " she said .
" he drove to his former home a couple of times and met and chatted with people there .
it helps expellees explore their past and reach a sense of inner peace .

despite fears over " happy slapping " , text bullying and mobile crime , parents say that young people are safer with them than without , say researchers .
young people were more concerned about happy slapping than their parents , with two-thirds reporting they had been a victim or knew someone who had been .
the research was carried out by the the trust for study of adolescence and showed that parents typically bought children mobiles when they moved to secondary schools so they could keep track of them and for emergencies .
but while parents said they liked to call their children on the mobile because they felt more reassured when they actually heard their voice , young people preferred to text parents .
risk taking the research also showed having a mobile increased young people 's feeling of independence and was frequently used to plan arrangements both with parents and friends .
kerry devitt , researcher for the trust for the study of adolescence explained : " while mobile phones do n't encourage young people to take more risks , they do see them as providing more flexibility . "
girls are more likely to text parents than boys , says research in particular , young people often used mobiles as a negotiating tool , often to stay out later .
the fact that the child owned a mobile meant parents were more likely to be flexible in such arrangements , the researchers found .
the study also showed that girls were much more likely to text parents to let them know they were safe than boys and were also more likely to use text messaging for social purposes .
the trust for the study of adolescence research included interviews with 60 families from across the uk from different social and ethnic backgrounds .
ofcom , the uk 's communications regulator , recently reported that 82 % of 12 to 15-year-olds owned a mobile phone while just under half -lrb- 49 % -rrb- of 8 to 11-year-olds had one .
across both age groups , they make an average of eight calls and send 25 text messages a week .
mobile politics it is not only parents who are seeking to connect with young people through mobile technologies .
the prevalence of mobile phones among younger age groups has led politicians , civic organisations and campaign groups to look for ways to provide text messaging as a channel for interaction .
in late 2004 , the uk government offered the opportunity to " text tony " .
people were invited to send a text question to the prime minister to be answered as part of a " mobile chat " .
since then , there have been a number of initiatives to get young people more involved in politics through more mobile channels .
the hansard society recently launched a citizen calling project -lrb- www.citizencalling.com -rrb- which asked young people to send messages or videos to the uk parliament via their mobiles .
these were then hosted on the campaign website and available for others to see .
the impact of the pilot is currently being assessed .
other support groups , such as the samaritans , have been running support services to enable young people to contact them using text messages .
while the samaritans ' service is still in its pilot stage and is not yet rolled out across the country , since april the organisation has received nearly 80,000 texts from more than 3,000 callers - the equivalent of one text every three minutes .
part of the popularity of text messaging for young people come from the fact they see their mobiles as a key part of their identity .
they are private , personal devices which give young people independence of both movement and communication .
text messages can be used in when it is difficult to talk , for example , or where teenagers do not want to be engaged in a conversation .
deeper understanding while the trust for the study of adolescence research provides some enlightenment for adults looking to understand how young people adapt new technologies , much is still unknown about the role of mobiles in their everyday lives .
little is known about how they impact the way young people from different socio-economic groups make friends , socially network and communicate with others in public and in private .
but such an understanding is important if effective text-based support services are to be successful with young people and if the mobile is to be used as a way of getting more young people actively interested in politics .

despite fears over " happy slapping " , text bullying and mobile crime , parents say that young people are safer with them than without , say researchers .
young people were more concerned about happy slapping than their parents , with two-thirds reporting they had been a victim or knew someone who had been .
the research was carried out by the the trust for study of adolescence and showed that parents typically bought children mobiles when they moved to secondary schools so they could keep track of them and for emergencies .
but while parents said they liked to call their children on the mobile because they felt more reassured when they actually heard their voice , young people preferred to text parents .
risk taking the research also showed having a mobile increased young people 's feeling of independence and was frequently used to plan arrangements both with parents and friends .
kerry devitt , researcher for the trust for the study of adolescence explained : " while mobile phones do n't encourage young people to take more risks , they do see them as providing more flexibility . "
in particular , young people often used mobiles as a negotiating tool , often to stay out later .
the fact that the child owned a mobile meant parents were more likely to be flexible in such arrangements , the researchers found .
the study also showed that girls were much more likely to text parents to let them know they were safe than boys and were also more likely to use text messaging for social purposes .
the trust for the study of adolescence research included interviews with 60 families from across the uk from different social and ethnic backgrounds .
ofcom , the uk 's communications regulator , recently reported that 82 % of 12 to 15-year-olds owned a mobile phone while just under half -lrb- 49 % -rrb- of 8 to 11-year-olds had one .
across both age groups , they make an average of eight calls and send 25 text messages a week .
mobile politics it is not only parents who are seeking to connect with young people through mobile technologies .
the prevalence of mobile phones among younger age groups has led politicians , civic organisations and campaign groups to look for ways to provide text messaging as a channel for interaction .
in late 2004 , the uk government offered the opportunity to " text tony " .
people were invited to send a text question to the prime minister to be answered as part of a " mobile chat " .
since then , there have been a number of initiatives to get young people more involved in politics through more mobile channels .
the hansard society recently launched a citizen calling project -lrb- www.citizencalling.com -rrb- which asked young people to send messages or videos to the uk parliament via their mobiles .
these were then hosted on the campaign website and available for others to see .
the impact of the pilot is currently being assessed .
other support groups , such as the samaritans , have been running support services to enable young people to contact them using text messages .
while the samaritans ' service is still in its pilot stage and is not yet rolled out across the country , since april the organisation has received nearly 80,000 texts from more than 3,000 callers - the equivalent of one text every three minutes .
part of the popularity of text messaging for young people come from the fact they see their mobiles as a key part of their identity .
they are private , personal devices which give young people independence of both movement and communication .
text messages can be used in when it is difficult to talk , for example , or where teenagers do not want to be engaged in a conversation .
deeper understanding while the trust for the study of adolescence research provides some enlightenment for adults looking to understand how young people adapt new technologies , much is still unknown about the role of mobiles in their everyday lives .
little is known about how they impact the way young people from different socio-economic groups make friends , socially network and communicate with others in public and in private .
but such an understanding is important if effective text-based support services are to be successful with young people and if the mobile is to be used as a way of getting more young people actively interested in politics .

chris rogers the politics show south west this could be the next step for these young politicians ...
what were you doing when you were 13 ?
i betray no secrets in saying that for me , it was a very long time ago , but i think i was collecting cigarette cards , practising the violin badly , being average at tennis and rubbish at football .
i do know i was not interested in politics .
i did n't encounter anything resembling political activity until i went to university , when a succession of student sit-ins and marches all seemed a bit futile and frankly rather silly .
well , it seems today 's teenagers are made of sterner stuff .
they are better informed about the world around them , more clued-up about injustice and , thanks to the internet , much more likely to feel part of a community of shared ideas and shared action .
youth parliament three years ago , when hamish mccallum from illogan in cornwall was 13 , he was not collecting cigarette cards , but he was serving as one of three county members of the united kingdom youth parliament .
like its members , this is a young body , which began meeting in 2001 , and consists of 300 myps -lrb- members of the youth parliament -rrb- from across the uk .
they are all aged between 11 and 18 , all elected by their fellow pupils , and they meet in a national congress once a year to discuss issues of mutual concern .
the idea has attracted the support of westminster mps and traditional politicians everywhere , not least because of the growing unease about the so-called " dis-engagement " of young people with the democratic system .
the uk youth parliament must offer a reassuring endorsement that all is not so bad with the political world after all .
a real voice nevertheless , let us be fair , it is not just a prop for a worried westminster .
it is genuinely useful as a forum for today 's increasingly pressurised teenagers to say what 's wrong with the world we have made for them and to try to formulate plans to put things right .
sceptical adults can also dismiss thoughts that all they are interested in is more pocket money and a skateboard park round every corner .
the internet has made them much more savvy .
issue orientated hamish is still only 16 but has seen the youth parliament contribute to the debate on affordable housing in the south west , probably the most all-consuming topic in cornwall , the land of the second home .
he has friends and relatives who are all struggling to reach the first rung of the housing ladder .
as he says himself , in a couple of years ' time it will be his turn to be looking for somewhere to live .
why should n't tomorrow 's hopeful homeowners , today 's teenagers , be engaged in intelligent and informed debate in a democratically-elected forum about such a crucial issue , especially when their ideas and conclusions are said to be so important to those in westminster who have the real power ?
elections imminent the election process for next year 's myps is just beginning , which is why 100 cornish teenagers congregated at newquay 's fistral beach for a fun day of information to see if they would like to stand for the parliament .
hamish was on hand to pass on his hard-won experience .
hamish takes part in the politics show south west debate about young people and democracy that you can see this sunday on bbc one .

chris rogers the politics show south west what were you doing when you were 13 ?
i betray no secrets in saying that for me , it was a very long time ago , but i think i was collecting cigarette cards , practising the violin badly , being average at tennis and rubbish at football .
i do know i was not interested in politics .
i did n't encounter anything resembling political activity until i went to university , when a succession of student sit-ins and marches all seemed a bit futile and frankly rather silly .
well , it seems today 's teenagers are made of sterner stuff .
they are better informed about the world around them , more clued-up about injustice and , thanks to the internet , much more likely to feel part of a community of shared ideas and shared action .
youth parliament three years ago , when hamish mccallum from illogan in cornwall was 13 , he was not collecting cigarette cards , but he was serving as one of three county members of the united kingdom youth parliament .
like its members , this is a young body , which began meeting in 2001 , and consists of 300 myps -lrb- members of the youth parliament -rrb- from across the uk .
they are all aged between 11 and 18 , all elected by their fellow pupils , and they meet in a national congress once a year to discuss issues of mutual concern .
the idea has attracted the support of westminster mps and traditional politicians everywhere , not least because of the growing unease about the so-called " dis-engagement " of young people with the democratic system .
the uk youth parliament must offer a reassuring endorsement that all is not so bad with the political world after all .
a real voice nevertheless , let us be fair , it is not just a prop for a worried westminster .
it is genuinely useful as a forum for today 's increasingly pressurised teenagers to say what 's wrong with the world we have made for them and to try to formulate plans to put things right .
sceptical adults can also dismiss thoughts that all they are interested in is more pocket money and a skateboard park round every corner .
the internet has made them much more savvy .
issue orientated hamish is still only 16 but has seen the youth parliament contribute to the debate on affordable housing in the south west , probably the most all-consuming topic in cornwall , the land of the second home .
he has friends and relatives who are all struggling to reach the first rung of the housing ladder .
as he says himself , in a couple of years ' time it will be his turn to be looking for somewhere to live .
why should n't tomorrow 's hopeful homeowners , today 's teenagers , be engaged in intelligent and informed debate in a democratically-elected forum about such a crucial issue , especially when their ideas and conclusions are said to be so important to those in westminster who have the real power ?
elections imminent the election process for next year 's myps is just beginning , which is why 100 cornish teenagers congregated at newquay 's fistral beach for a fun day of information to see if they would like to stand for the parliament .
hamish was on hand to pass on his hard-won experience .
hamish takes part in the politics show south west debate about young people and democracy that you can see this sunday on bbc one .
return to this week 's main page ...

this is again a discriminatory tax .
the price of housing in the south of england bears little relationship to the wealth of the people .
our two bedroomed bungalow in hampshire banded e £ 1,600 per year would hit the £ 2,000 per year .
unaffordable .
christine melsom , england its mad what we are paying now .
councils need to stop being political and to actually provide the local services that people require .
will end up paying a fortune a month and will not even get my rubbish picked up every week .
richard jones , kent how would this affect us as retired smallholders where the value of the property is mainly in the surrounding 20acres .
the house itself , our home for the last 40 + years , has no heating or really modern conveniences ?
penelope sargent , england this is the most shocking prospect that at coming up to 65 i saw the last 5 minutes of today ¿ s politics show and am appalled they should consider modifying council tax ... again .
this year i was hit with re-banding , why was it not introduced in england as well ?
that would have made it more tolerable , i am of course a pensioner !
robin binnington , wales rather than spend my income on big cars and expensive holidays i elected to invest it in my property .
i now own a 4 bed detached house in a band f area where some may be able to afford any increase in charges .
as a public servant my income is relatively small and i can not afford to pay more .
if i had not spent £ 1,000 on dental charges for the family this year i might be more accepting of an increase .
jeremy stout , england the programme today on re-offending was most interesting .
however , i think it is important to clarify the statistic about international comparisons of imprisonment rates : it may be the case that more people per population are in prison in england than in other european countries but i understand that fewer persons are imprisoned per crime than in any other country than sweden .
what is the divisor ?
if england has an extraordinarily high crime rate then more persons will be in prison simply because of that .
without this clarity discussions become pantomime : the imprisonment rate is higher / oh no it ¿ s not !
robert kibblewhite , england local council funding should be based on the land value , not the capital value .
land is the scarce resource that needs to be utilised to maximum effect .
a land tax would encourage efficient land use .
taxing the capital value discourages people from maintaining or improving their property , as they will have to pay more tax .
henry lion , england years of age my council tax bill could move from current £ 2,357 to nearly £ 5,000 .
principally we have extended our house significantly but why do house values affect service costs .
the house is bigger but we still use the exact same facilities as before .
my current reaction is to move out of this country as moving to pension age means we could not afford £ 413pw council tax for our current home .
having paid all taxes without exception for all my working life i feel such a move as this affecting all fixed income pensioners is a step too far .

this year i was hit with re-banding , why was it not introduced in england as well ?
that would have made it more tolerable , i am of course a pensioner !
robin binnington , wales rather than spend my income on big cars and expensive holidays i elected to invest it in my property .
i now own a 4 bed detached house in a band f area where some may be able to afford any increase in charges .
as a public servant my income is relatively small and i can not afford to pay more .
if i had not spent £ 1,000 on dental charges for the family this year i might be more accepting of an increase .
jeremy stout , england the programme today on re-offending was most interesting .
however , i think it is important to clarify the statistic about international comparisons of imprisonment rates : it may be the case that more people per population are in prison in england than in other european countries but i understand that fewer persons are imprisoned per crime than in any other country than sweden .
what is the divisor ?
if england has an extraordinarily high crime rate then more persons will be in prison simply because of that .
without this clarity discussions become pantomime : the imprisonment rate is higher / oh no it ¿ s not !
robert kibblewhite , england local council funding should be based on the land value , not the capital value .
land is the scarce resource that needs to be utilised to maximum effect .
a land tax would encourage efficient land use .
taxing the capital value discourages people from maintaining or improving their property , as they will have to pay more tax .
henry lion , england years of age my council tax bill could move from current £ 2,357 to nearly £ 5,000 .
principally we have extended our house significantly but why do house values affect service costs .
the house is bigger but we still use the exact same facilities as before .
my current reaction is to move out of this country as moving to pension age means we could not afford £ 413pw council tax for our current home .
having paid all taxes without exception for all my working life i feel such a move as this affecting all fixed income pensioners is a step too far .
