' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .

they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent .

new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .

" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities .

it has to adjust , and doctors are eager to know more about this process of adjustment . gravity keeps our feet firmly planted on the ground .
that ’ s why we can always tell up from down .
in a weightless environment , however , these signals that our bodies need for orientation are no longer there .
" we really don ’ t notice that we ’ re standing on the ceiling " says thomas reiter .
" you first have to learn to learn to trust the information your eyes are sending your brain more than your gut feelings .
the sensation of gravity simply isn ’ t present . "
that ’ s why all astronauts have problems with orientation the first time in orbit .
but because the human brain is so flexible , astronauts are able to slowly adjust to weightlessness over a few days .
doctors are studying this ability in the hopes that it will teach them more about medical conditions , such as the equilibrium problems experienced by many elderly patients .
another problem is that after arriving in space , around two litres of the blood and bodily fluids that is usually distributed throughout an astronaut ’ s legs ends up in his abdominal cavity , chest and head .
that makes a whole new set of demands on the body ’ s circulatory system .
some of the symptoms that occur resemble those caused by common diseases here on earth .
when astronauts spend long periods in weightlessness , their muscles begin to atrophy and their bones become thin and brittle , especially in the spine and the legs .
unlike the similar condition common with osteoporosis , however , these degenerative conditions are halted when the astronaut returns to the surface . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 journey to space more info on thomas reiter 's journey to space the control center the experiments six months in space reiters mission astronaut biography questions for thomas reiter further links construction in space not a great place for a walk never forget your suit unwanted side effects an energy supply in space more power for the iss oil emulsion experiment in space astrolab – the experiments space as a laboratory human body in space supplies for the iss the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- shuttle : the next generation video : portrait thomas reiter © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .
nevertheless the news that the company was effectively bankrupt came as a shock to most of them . " we are deeply hurt , " workers ' representatives on the board said .
they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .
new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .
mueller also criticized the traditional german company of resorting to radical measures in order to fulfill short-term profit goals . " benq staff is now paying for the failings of siemens ' management , " he says . future production in asia a siemens spokeswoman said the company was watching developments at benq .
" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities . " they waited until the siemens money was used up and then simply turned off the tap , " a sector analyst says . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

that would be the conservatives ' worst result since german reunification . the german public is losing confidence in both chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , according to an opinion poll conducted on behalf of public broadcaster zdf and published on friday . in the last four weeks , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , lost three percentage points and landed at 33 percent .
that is the worst result that germany 's largest conservative parties have had in regular opinion polls since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the historic low in opinion polls for the christian democrats is seen as a consequence of the ongoing debate in the grand coalition government about the reform of the country 's health-care system .
amidst the continuous disagreements between cdu / csu and its coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , 83 percent of those polled said they did n't believe the current government was capable of solving germany 's health-care issues in the long term . winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel manage to keep the coalition government together ?

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .

she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .

last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .
nevertheless the news that the company was effectively bankrupt came as a shock to most of them . " we are deeply hurt , " workers ' representatives on the board said .
they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .
new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .
mueller also criticized the traditional german company of resorting to radical measures in order to fulfill short-term profit goals . " benq staff is now paying for the failings of siemens ' management , " he says . future production in asia a siemens spokeswoman said the company was watching developments at benq .
" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .

if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade . " it is winnable but it requires a concerted effort , " said nato spokesman james appathurai , and added : " the international donors , the united nations , the european union , the non-governmental organizations , they all have to step up their game , all of them .

in recent attention-grabbing headlines , illegal immigrants to europe accused greek authorities of dumping them into the sea off the coast of turkey , where some drowned . also , mounting pressure from illegal immigration has led french and spanish politicians to exchanged angry words on the subject . spain on the front lines spain sees itself in the front line of the battle against illegal immigrants .
it is desperate for assistance to help cope with the huge wave of arrivals - 25,000 this year alone - currently overwhelming authorities in the canary islands . on friday in madrid , ministers from eight countries - spain , france , portugal , italy , greece , malta , cyprus and slovenia - will be joined by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and ritva viljanen , state secretary for the interior ministry from eu presidency holder finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini will be on hand in madrid franco frattini and benita ferrero-waldner , european commissioners for justice and security and external relations respectively , will also be present , as will the director of frontex , the eu 's stretched external-border agency . spain is expected to propose a joint european strategy for its southern maritime borders that would serve as a basis for discussions at an informal european summit on oct .
20 in finland . spain 's appeals have met with sympathy among other countries in southern europe such as italy and greece , which have also been dealing with their own waves of clandestine immigration from west africa , libya and turkey . some 16,000 clandestine immigrants have been intercepted by italian coastal patrols between the beginning of january and sept .
18 , italian interior minister giuliano amato said wednesday . but madrid 's entreaties have fallen on deaf ears in other european countries . only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or planes to the eu 's frontex border agency , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , alongside spanish boats in the area . french-spanish discord spanish socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has also come under fire for spain 's regularization of some 600,000 unregistered immigrants in 2005 , with critics charging that the policy encouraged illegal immigration . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who was due at the madrid conclave and who last week signed a deal on " managed migration " with senegal , was among the detractors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , france saw massive rioting tied to its immigration policies countries giving residence papers to clandestine immigrants should not be surprised " to find themselves in the front line for massive waves of illegals , " the right-wing presidential hopeful declared earlier this week . zapatero hit back on wednesday , saying spain had " no lessons " to learn from france in matters of immigration policy after the riots last year in french suburbs , which were set off when two youths died after grabbing hold of electrical wires while they were trying to avoid an immigration police search . but beyond trading insults , spain is also hoping that friday 's get-together will come up with concrete proposals . deaths in greece " eu regulations deal with concepts for land and air borders , but not maritime -lrb- borders -rrb- , and we also have responsibilities for control and surveillance , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos . rescue workers estimate that some 550 people have died attempting the perilous crossing from west africa to the canaries this year . meanwhile , the un 's refugee agency is looking into the death of six illegal immigrants off turkey 's western coast amid allegations that they drowned after being dumped into the sea by greek authorities , a un spokesman in ankara told news agencies on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of would-be immigrants to the eu from north africa and elsewhere has hit crisis proportions .
the un high commissioner for refugees is also trying to organize a meeting between the turkish and greek coastguards to encourage them to boost cooperation in the aegean sea , where deadly incidents involving poor illegal immigrants from asia and africa are frequent . on tuesday , six people from middle east countries drowned , three went missing and 31 others were rescued off the western turkish town of karaburun in izmir province . in their testimony to the police , quoted by turkish officials , the survivors claimed they sailed clandestinely from a coastal point in izmir to the nearby greek island of chios overnight but were caught by the greek authorities . they alleged they were then put on a boat early in the morning and dumped into the sea close to the turkish coast , where local residents alerted the coastguard after hearing their cries . greek denial greek officials denied the allegations and accused regional rival turkey of not cooperating in the fight against illegal immigration . " we are currently following the issue via the media and we are not in a position to say who is responsible , " said metin corabatir , spokesman of the unhcr office in ankara . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain pushes for european response to illegal immigration spain has launched a new push for european help in dealing with a massive wave of illegal immigrants washing onto its shores in the canary islands .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .

if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade . " it is winnable but it requires a concerted effort , " said nato spokesman james appathurai , and added : " the international donors , the united nations , the european union , the non-governmental organizations , they all have to step up their game , all of them .

in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters .

" if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 29.09.2006 germany agonizes over monet sale to pay gallery repairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of monet 's series of london parliament paintings could be sacrificed a modest art gallery in krefeld has inadvertently scandalized the nation 's art lovers by threatening to sell its most precious canvas , a $ 25 million monet , to pay for roof leaks and other urgent repairs . krefeld near cologne is not a town often in the national gaze .
but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2006 benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german factory workers are not happy that siemens-benq has declared insolvency the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed . the news of the insolvency hit staff like a bolt from the blue , according to wolfgang mueller of the ig metall trade union . ' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .
nevertheless the news that the company was effectively bankrupt came as a shock to most of them . " we are deeply hurt , " workers ' representatives on the board said .
they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .
new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .
mueller also criticized the traditional german company of resorting to radical measures in order to fulfill short-term profit goals . " benq staff is now paying for the failings of siemens ' management , " he says . future production in asia a siemens spokeswoman said the company was watching developments at benq .
" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities . " they waited until the siemens money was used up and then simply turned off the tap , " a sector analyst says . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .
the german tech giant , however , is believed to have gotten the better end of the deal .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters .

if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2006 benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german factory workers are not happy that siemens-benq has declared insolvency the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed . the news of the insolvency hit staff like a bolt from the blue , according to wolfgang mueller of the ig metall trade union . ' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .
nevertheless the news that the company was effectively bankrupt came as a shock to most of them . " we are deeply hurt , " workers ' representatives on the board said .
they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .
new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .
mueller also criticized the traditional german company of resorting to radical measures in order to fulfill short-term profit goals . " benq staff is now paying for the failings of siemens ' management , " he says . future production in asia a siemens spokeswoman said the company was watching developments at benq .
" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities . " they waited until the siemens money was used up and then simply turned off the tap , " a sector analyst says . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 29.09.2006 germany agonizes over monet sale to pay gallery repairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of monet 's series of london parliament paintings could be sacrificed a modest art gallery in krefeld has inadvertently scandalized the nation 's art lovers by threatening to sell its most precious canvas , a $ 25 million monet , to pay for roof leaks and other urgent repairs . krefeld near cologne is not a town often in the national gaze .
but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

in recent attention-grabbing headlines , illegal immigrants to europe accused greek authorities of dumping them into the sea off the coast of turkey , where some drowned . also , mounting pressure from illegal immigration has led french and spanish politicians to exchanged angry words on the subject . spain on the front lines spain sees itself in the front line of the battle against illegal immigrants .
it is desperate for assistance to help cope with the huge wave of arrivals - 25,000 this year alone - currently overwhelming authorities in the canary islands . on friday in madrid , ministers from eight countries - spain , france , portugal , italy , greece , malta , cyprus and slovenia - will be joined by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and ritva viljanen , state secretary for the interior ministry from eu presidency holder finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini will be on hand in madrid franco frattini and benita ferrero-waldner , european commissioners for justice and security and external relations respectively , will also be present , as will the director of frontex , the eu 's stretched external-border agency . spain is expected to propose a joint european strategy for its southern maritime borders that would serve as a basis for discussions at an informal european summit on oct .
20 in finland . spain 's appeals have met with sympathy among other countries in southern europe such as italy and greece , which have also been dealing with their own waves of clandestine immigration from west africa , libya and turkey . some 16,000 clandestine immigrants have been intercepted by italian coastal patrols between the beginning of january and sept .
18 , italian interior minister giuliano amato said wednesday . but madrid 's entreaties have fallen on deaf ears in other european countries . only finland , italy and portugal have so far committed patrol boats or planes to the eu 's frontex border agency , operating off mauritania , senegal and cape verde , alongside spanish boats in the area . french-spanish discord spanish socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has also come under fire for spain 's regularization of some 600,000 unregistered immigrants in 2005 , with critics charging that the policy encouraged illegal immigration . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who was due at the madrid conclave and who last week signed a deal on " managed migration " with senegal , was among the detractors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , france saw massive rioting tied to its immigration policies countries giving residence papers to clandestine immigrants should not be surprised " to find themselves in the front line for massive waves of illegals , " the right-wing presidential hopeful declared earlier this week . zapatero hit back on wednesday , saying spain had " no lessons " to learn from france in matters of immigration policy after the riots last year in french suburbs , which were set off when two youths died after grabbing hold of electrical wires while they were trying to avoid an immigration police search . but beyond trading insults , spain is also hoping that friday 's get-together will come up with concrete proposals . deaths in greece " eu regulations deal with concepts for land and air borders , but not maritime -lrb- borders -rrb- , and we also have responsibilities for control and surveillance , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos . rescue workers estimate that some 550 people have died attempting the perilous crossing from west africa to the canaries this year . meanwhile , the un 's refugee agency is looking into the death of six illegal immigrants off turkey 's western coast amid allegations that they drowned after being dumped into the sea by greek authorities , a un spokesman in ankara told news agencies on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flow of would-be immigrants to the eu from north africa and elsewhere has hit crisis proportions .
the un high commissioner for refugees is also trying to organize a meeting between the turkish and greek coastguards to encourage them to boost cooperation in the aegean sea , where deadly incidents involving poor illegal immigrants from asia and africa are frequent . on tuesday , six people from middle east countries drowned , three went missing and 31 others were rescued off the western turkish town of karaburun in izmir province . in their testimony to the police , quoted by turkish officials , the survivors claimed they sailed clandestinely from a coastal point in izmir to the nearby greek island of chios overnight but were caught by the greek authorities . they alleged they were then put on a boat early in the morning and dumped into the sea close to the turkish coast , where local residents alerted the coastguard after hearing their cries . greek denial greek officials denied the allegations and accused regional rival turkey of not cooperating in the fight against illegal immigration .

that would be the conservatives ' worst result since german reunification . the german public is losing confidence in both chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , according to an opinion poll conducted on behalf of public broadcaster zdf and published on friday . in the last four weeks , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , lost three percentage points and landed at 33 percent .
that is the worst result that germany 's largest conservative parties have had in regular opinion polls since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the historic low in opinion polls for the christian democrats is seen as a consequence of the ongoing debate in the grand coalition government about the reform of the country 's health-care system .
amidst the continuous disagreements between cdu / csu and its coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , 83 percent of those polled said they did n't believe the current government was capable of solving germany 's health-care issues in the long term . winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel manage to keep the coalition government together ?
the social democrats did slightly better , gaining one percentage point since the last poll , to reach 31 .
but the true winners seems to be the opposition free-market liberal fdp , whose rating rose by 2 percentage points to 13 , their highest rating since at least oct .
1994 . support for the green party remained at 9 percent . merkel 's own ratings fell over the past four weeks , too .
one month ago , the german chancellor placed third on the list of the country 's 10 most important politicians .
now , however , merkel placed fifth - after foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- , spd chief kurt beck , lower saxony premier christian wulff and interior minister wolfgang schäuble -lrb- both of cdu -rrb- . lack of confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latest poll results do not bode well for the german government in july 2006 , 64 percent of those surveyed thought that angela merkel was capable of asserting herself in important political matters .
today , only 52 percent of voters rated merkel 's assertiveness positively . the overall popularity of the government is on the decline as well .
almost one year ago , the coalition of social democrats and christian democrats was supported by 52 percent of germans .
today , their ratings are down to 33 percent . sixty-five percent of germans believe that relations between the grand coalition partners are mostly bad - a 14 percent drop since the beginning of september . the survey was conducted between sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2006 benq 's german workers blame former owners siemens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german factory workers are not happy that siemens-benq has declared insolvency the decision by taiwan 's benq to shut off further investment in its german subsidiary benq-siemens and seek insolvency protection has left the company 's 3,000 employees feeling betrayed . the news of the insolvency hit staff like a bolt from the blue , according to wolfgang mueller of the ig metall trade union . ' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .
nevertheless the news that the company was effectively bankrupt came as a shock to most of them . " we are deeply hurt , " workers ' representatives on the board said .
they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .
nevertheless the news that the company was effectively bankrupt came as a shock to most of them . " we are deeply hurt , " workers ' representatives on the board said .
they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .
new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .
mueller also criticized the traditional german company of resorting to radical measures in order to fulfill short-term profit goals . " benq staff is now paying for the failings of siemens ' management , " he says . future production in asia a siemens spokeswoman said the company was watching developments at benq .
" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities . " they waited until the siemens money was used up and then simply turned off the tap , " a sector analyst says . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens better off in telecom merger with nokia analysts and investors reacted positively to the announcement of a joint telecom venture between siemens and nokia .
the german tech giant , however , is believed to have gotten the better end of the deal .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 29.09.2006 german christian democrats hit low in opinion poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition govenment is increasingly losing popularity if germany had to elect a new government today , angela merkel 's christian democrats would win only 33 percent of the votes .
that would be the conservatives ' worst result since german reunification . the german public is losing confidence in both chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , according to an opinion poll conducted on behalf of public broadcaster zdf and published on friday . in the last four weeks , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , lost three percentage points and landed at 33 percent .
that is the worst result that germany 's largest conservative parties have had in regular opinion polls since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the historic low in opinion polls for the christian democrats is seen as a consequence of the ongoing debate in the grand coalition government about the reform of the country 's health-care system .
amidst the continuous disagreements between cdu / csu and its coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , 83 percent of those polled said they did n't believe the current government was capable of solving germany 's health-care issues in the long term . winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel manage to keep the coalition government together ?
the social democrats did slightly better , gaining one percentage point since the last poll , to reach 31 .
but the true winners seems to be the opposition free-market liberal fdp , whose rating rose by 2 percentage points to 13 , their highest rating since at least oct .

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .

but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .

the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .

the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .

she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .

with her perfect bone structure and aloof beauty , she was emblematic of hollywood 's glamorous heyday - a quality with enormous economic potential . and although she spurned the limelight , la dietrich was by no means averse to topping up her bank account with the occasional ad - promoting everything from luxor soap and lucky strike cigarettes to rheingold beer and air france . posthumous marketing in the cut-throat world of celebrity culture , most stars are happy to spend the time when they 're " resting " between roles to plug a few products in exchange for a juicy pay check .

in recent attention-grabbing headlines , illegal immigrants to europe accused greek authorities of dumping them into the sea off the coast of turkey , where some drowned . also , mounting pressure from illegal immigration has led french and spanish politicians to exchanged angry words on the subject . spain on the front lines spain sees itself in the front line of the battle against illegal immigrants .
it is desperate for assistance to help cope with the huge wave of arrivals - 25,000 this year alone - currently overwhelming authorities in the canary islands . on friday in madrid , ministers from eight countries - spain , france , portugal , italy , greece , malta , cyprus and slovenia - will be joined by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and ritva viljanen , state secretary for the interior ministry from eu presidency holder finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini will be on hand in madrid franco frattini and benita ferrero-waldner , european commissioners for justice and security and external relations respectively , will also be present , as will the director of frontex , the eu 's stretched external-border agency . spain is expected to propose a joint european strategy for its southern maritime borders that would serve as a basis for discussions at an informal european summit on oct .

the un high commissioner for refugees is also trying to organize a meeting between the turkish and greek coastguards to encourage them to boost cooperation in the aegean sea , where deadly incidents involving poor illegal immigrants from asia and africa are frequent . on tuesday , six people from middle east countries drowned , three went missing and 31 others were rescued off the western turkish town of karaburun in izmir province . in their testimony to the police , quoted by turkish officials , the survivors claimed they sailed clandestinely from a coastal point in izmir to the nearby greek island of chios overnight but were caught by the greek authorities . they alleged they were then put on a boat early in the morning and dumped into the sea close to the turkish coast , where local residents alerted the coastguard after hearing their cries . greek denial greek officials denied the allegations and accused regional rival turkey of not cooperating in the fight against illegal immigration .

in recent attention-grabbing headlines , illegal immigrants to europe accused greek authorities of dumping them into the sea off the coast of turkey , where some drowned . also , mounting pressure from illegal immigration has led french and spanish politicians to exchanged angry words on the subject . spain on the front lines spain sees itself in the front line of the battle against illegal immigrants .

the un high commissioner for refugees is also trying to organize a meeting between the turkish and greek coastguards to encourage them to boost cooperation in the aegean sea , where deadly incidents involving poor illegal immigrants from asia and africa are frequent . on tuesday , six people from middle east countries drowned , three went missing and 31 others were rescued off the western turkish town of karaburun in izmir province . in their testimony to the police , quoted by turkish officials , the survivors claimed they sailed clandestinely from a coastal point in izmir to the nearby greek island of chios overnight but were caught by the greek authorities . they alleged they were then put on a boat early in the morning and dumped into the sea close to the turkish coast , where local residents alerted the coastguard after hearing their cries . greek denial greek officials denied the allegations and accused regional rival turkey of not cooperating in the fight against illegal immigration .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .

" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .

new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 29.09.2006 germany agonizes over monet sale to pay gallery repairs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of monet 's series of london parliament paintings could be sacrificed a modest art gallery in krefeld has inadvertently scandalized the nation 's art lovers by threatening to sell its most precious canvas , a $ 25 million monet , to pay for roof leaks and other urgent repairs . krefeld near cologne is not a town often in the national gaze .
but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ?

" if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .

if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .
nato sources said romania , canada , denmark and the czech republic also made offers . hearts and minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan in crisis the taliban , ousted by the us-led military coalition in late 2001 for harboring al qaeda leader osama bin laden , has been backed by allies among drug runners and fighters loyal to local warlords . as it seeks to reclaim taliban-infested territory , isaf also hopes to win hearts and minds by helping build new roads , bridges and schools , as well as provide jobs . but development is lagging and nato 's most ambitious security enterprise faces failure if afghans lose interest in democracy and turn once again to the fundamentalist militia . analysts have suggested that nato 's worst nightmare might well come true , with afghans losing interest in democracy and a state modeled after western values .
if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade . " it is winnable but it requires a concerted effort , " said nato spokesman james appathurai , and added : " the international donors , the united nations , the european union , the non-governmental organizations , they all have to step up their game , all of them .

-lrb- 28.09.2006 -rrb- nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

that would be the conservatives ' worst result since german reunification . the german public is losing confidence in both chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , according to an opinion poll conducted on behalf of public broadcaster zdf and published on friday . in the last four weeks , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , lost three percentage points and landed at 33 percent .
that is the worst result that germany 's largest conservative parties have had in regular opinion polls since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the historic low in opinion polls for the christian democrats is seen as a consequence of the ongoing debate in the grand coalition government about the reform of the country 's health-care system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2006 german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen kamm was fined 3,600 euros for his gear a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol . how far can individuals go in using a symbol banned by the german constitution ?
it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .
bildunterschrift : leftists will have to pick a more neutral symbol green party leader claudia roth called the case " counterproductive . "
she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .
a hitler salute it is n't the first time that left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis .
last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .
earlier this year , however , authorities in berlin allowed filmmaker dani levy to display swastikas during the filming of a comedy about hitler . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goes to trial for selling anti-nazi symbols a german court wants to fine a businessman who is on trial for selling anti-nazi paraphernalia including crossed-out swastika symbols .

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .

last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .

they said they had believed assurances from taiwan that the company would be retained . at the company 's plant at kamp-lintfort there was anger and frustration .
many members of staff learnt of the company 's pending insolvency over the radio as they were on their way into work . " we already see ourselves in line at the employment office , " one member of staff said at the gates to the plant .
" insolvency is the best thing for benq .
then they do n't have to pay us a cent . " trouble keeping up with the market siemens was unable to make a go of its mobile division , showing little aptitude for keeping up with consumer trends , such as color display and photography , where the company entered the market late . benq aimed to change this , but relied largely on the original management . " in reality , the problems simply continued , " a sector analyst said . the company 's flexibility and speed in reacting to new developments still left much to be desired . siemens is no longer involved in the corporate group .
new siemens head klaus kleinfeld has promised that by early next year all divisions in the electrical group will have achieved ambitious profit margins . new siemens boss opted to drop mobile division the mobile phone division had no chance of doing so and kleinfeld took the logical , if drastic , step of complete disposal .
siemens has also disposed of other units or entered into partnerships with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many employees heard the news on the radio the mobile phone division went to benq for a symbolic price , with the taiwanese receiving millions from siemens to sweeten the deal . " we felt like an unwanted child , " says one member of staff who has been with siemens and benq for 39 years . he said he sees it as a shame that siemens did not have the courage and patience to revitalize its problematic units .
mueller also criticized the traditional german company of resorting to radical measures in order to fulfill short-term profit goals . " benq staff is now paying for the failings of siemens ' management , " he says . future production in asia a siemens spokeswoman said the company was watching developments at benq .
" we are very sorry to see this , " she said . benq aims to use the brand and the expertise of its former siemens division , but the mobile phones themselves will in future be produced in asia . many in germany suspected when the taiwanese bought the unit last year that they were only interested in the brand name and not in the relatively expensive german production facilities .

" the timeline that was agreed in new york stays , and we are getting short now in terms of that time , " he said , referring to the moment when the six nations would seek un sanctions against tehran . the deadline has not been officially revealed by the six nations , which also include britain , china , france , russia and the united states , but european diplomats involved in the negotiations said it was sometime next week . " the ball is in their court , " mccormack said thursday of the iranians .
" nobody wants to go down the path of sanctions - that is not our first choice .
but we are prepared , along with the p-5-plus-1 , to go down that path if that 's the door that the iranian regime wants to open , " he said . meanwhile , the us house of representatives approved legislation to ramp up economic pressure on iran in an effort to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , author of the iran freedom support act , said the bill would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's solana with iran 's ali larijani the eu-iran talks focus on a list of economic and diplomatic incentives put forward by the six powers in june as a reward if iran suspends its uranium enrichment . the incentives include support for an iranian nuclear power industry and the first direct contacts between the us and iran in nearly 30 years . mccormack insisted that negotiations involving the united states could begin only after iran freezes its enrichment program and the suspension is verified by monitors from the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . the solana-larijani talks were believed to be focussing on the " sequencing " of a possible decision by iran to temporarily suspend enrichment and the subsequent start of full negotiations on the incentives package . european diplomats said larijani has offered a temporary suspension , but it was unclear if the proposal had the support of the various factions within the iranian leadership . the negotiations were given a fresh chance after washington , under pressure from europe and china , backed down on its demand for immediate sanctions against iran for failing to meet the august 31 deadline . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran negotiator sees " positive conclusions " in nuclear talks iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said thursday that two days of talks in berlin with the eu 's foreign policy chief solana had produced " some positive conclusions .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .
nato sources said romania , canada , denmark and the czech republic also made offers . hearts and minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan in crisis the taliban , ousted by the us-led military coalition in late 2001 for harboring al qaeda leader osama bin laden , has been backed by allies among drug runners and fighters loyal to local warlords . as it seeks to reclaim taliban-infested territory , isaf also hopes to win hearts and minds by helping build new roads , bridges and schools , as well as provide jobs . but development is lagging and nato 's most ambitious security enterprise faces failure if afghans lose interest in democracy and turn once again to the fundamentalist militia . analysts have suggested that nato 's worst nightmare might well come true , with afghans losing interest in democracy and a state modeled after western values .
if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade . " it is winnable but it requires a concerted effort , " said nato spokesman james appathurai , and added : " the international donors , the united nations , the european union , the non-governmental organizations , they all have to step up their game , all of them .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .

with her perfect bone structure and aloof beauty , she was emblematic of hollywood 's glamorous heyday - a quality with enormous economic potential . and although she spurned the limelight , la dietrich was by no means averse to topping up her bank account with the occasional ad - promoting everything from luxor soap and lucky strike cigarettes to rheingold beer and air france . posthumous marketing in the cut-throat world of celebrity culture , most stars are happy to spend the time when they 're " resting " between roles to plug a few products in exchange for a juicy pay check .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2006 german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen kamm was fined 3,600 euros for his gear a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol . how far can individuals go in using a symbol banned by the german constitution ?
it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .
bildunterschrift : leftists will have to pick a more neutral symbol green party leader claudia roth called the case " counterproductive . "
she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .
a hitler salute it is n't the first time that left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis .
last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .
earlier this year , however , authorities in berlin allowed filmmaker dani levy to display swastikas during the filming of a comedy about hitler . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goes to trial for selling anti-nazi symbols a german court wants to fine a businessman who is on trial for selling anti-nazi paraphernalia including crossed-out swastika symbols .

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .

she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .

last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .

the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .
nato sources said romania , canada , denmark and the czech republic also made offers . hearts and minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan in crisis the taliban , ousted by the us-led military coalition in late 2001 for harboring al qaeda leader osama bin laden , has been backed by allies among drug runners and fighters loyal to local warlords . as it seeks to reclaim taliban-infested territory , isaf also hopes to win hearts and minds by helping build new roads , bridges and schools , as well as provide jobs . but development is lagging and nato 's most ambitious security enterprise faces failure if afghans lose interest in democracy and turn once again to the fundamentalist militia . analysts have suggested that nato 's worst nightmare might well come true , with afghans losing interest in democracy and a state modeled after western values .
if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade . " it is winnable but it requires a concerted effort , " said nato spokesman james appathurai , and added : " the international donors , the united nations , the european union , the non-governmental organizations , they all have to step up their game , all of them .

-lrb- 28.09.2006 -rrb- nato allies reluctant to send more troops to afghanistan though nato member countries have acknowledged the need for more troops in southern afghanistan against an emboldened taliban insurgency , few countries are willing to commit them .

it has to adjust , and doctors are eager to know more about this process of adjustment . gravity keeps our feet firmly planted on the ground .
that ’ s why we can always tell up from down .
in a weightless environment , however , these signals that our bodies need for orientation are no longer there .
" we really don ’ t notice that we ’ re standing on the ceiling " says thomas reiter .
" you first have to learn to learn to trust the information your eyes are sending your brain more than your gut feelings .
the sensation of gravity simply isn ’ t present . "
that ’ s why all astronauts have problems with orientation the first time in orbit .
but because the human brain is so flexible , astronauts are able to slowly adjust to weightlessness over a few days .
doctors are studying this ability in the hopes that it will teach them more about medical conditions , such as the equilibrium problems experienced by many elderly patients .
another problem is that after arriving in space , around two litres of the blood and bodily fluids that is usually distributed throughout an astronaut ’ s legs ends up in his abdominal cavity , chest and head .
that makes a whole new set of demands on the body ’ s circulatory system .
some of the symptoms that occur resemble those caused by common diseases here on earth .
when astronauts spend long periods in weightlessness , their muscles begin to atrophy and their bones become thin and brittle , especially in the spine and the legs .

in recent attention-grabbing headlines , illegal immigrants to europe accused greek authorities of dumping them into the sea off the coast of turkey , where some drowned . also , mounting pressure from illegal immigration has led french and spanish politicians to exchanged angry words on the subject . spain on the front lines spain sees itself in the front line of the battle against illegal immigrants .
it is desperate for assistance to help cope with the huge wave of arrivals - 25,000 this year alone - currently overwhelming authorities in the canary islands . on friday in madrid , ministers from eight countries - spain , france , portugal , italy , greece , malta , cyprus and slovenia - will be joined by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and ritva viljanen , state secretary for the interior ministry from eu presidency holder finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini will be on hand in madrid franco frattini and benita ferrero-waldner , european commissioners for justice and security and external relations respectively , will also be present , as will the director of frontex , the eu 's stretched external-border agency . spain is expected to propose a joint european strategy for its southern maritime borders that would serve as a basis for discussions at an informal european summit on oct .

he only issued a press statement saying that a district court judge had sided with his lawyers , who had called for an injunction against media allegations that klippstein served as an informant of east germany 's infamous stasi secret police . " the court agreed with my lawyers , that media coverage about me was illegal and violated my rights , " klippstein wrote , according to german news service dpa . stunning coincidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klippstein inside the hotel 's presidential suite earlier in the week , german public broadcaster ndr had aired a documentary about the famous east german hotel neptun , where western vips had been spied on by the stasi .
according to the documentary , the hotel 's concierge had provided the stasi with information about guests under the code name " benjamin . " according to dpa , the real name of " benjamin " was thomas klippstein .
that man was born march 31 , 1962 and worked at hotel neptun before moving to dresden in 1988 .
the informant 's career path and birth year coincides with that of the current director of hotel adlon , according to news reports .
hotel officials would not confirm the exact birth date of the adlon director . home to the stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael jackson with his son at the adlon in 2002 taking over the reins at berlin 's hotel adlon , which sits on a square directly across from the city 's landmark brandenburg gate , has crowned klippstein 's stellar career since reunification .
he joined kempinski in 1993 and held executive positions at hotels in dresden , bangkok , st. petersburg and istanbul before returning to germany in 2001 .
one year later , he became the opening director of the group 's new heiligendamm resort on the baltic sea coast before coming to berlin in 2005 . the adlon , which was destroyed during the war and rebuilt after reunification , has hosted numerous heads of state , who have resided in the hotel 's presidential suite .

with her perfect bone structure and aloof beauty , she was emblematic of hollywood 's glamorous heyday - a quality with enormous economic potential . and although she spurned the limelight , la dietrich was by no means averse to topping up her bank account with the occasional ad - promoting everything from luxor soap and lucky strike cigarettes to rheingold beer and air france . posthumous marketing in the cut-throat world of celebrity culture , most stars are happy to spend the time when they 're " resting " between roles to plug a few products in exchange for a juicy pay check .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 29.09.2006 german christian democrats hit low in opinion poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grand coalition govenment is increasingly losing popularity if germany had to elect a new government today , angela merkel 's christian democrats would win only 33 percent of the votes .
that would be the conservatives ' worst result since german reunification . the german public is losing confidence in both chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , according to an opinion poll conducted on behalf of public broadcaster zdf and published on friday . in the last four weeks , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , lost three percentage points and landed at 33 percent .
that is the worst result that germany 's largest conservative parties have had in regular opinion polls since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the historic low in opinion polls for the christian democrats is seen as a consequence of the ongoing debate in the grand coalition government about the reform of the country 's health-care system .
amidst the continuous disagreements between cdu / csu and its coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , 83 percent of those polled said they did n't believe the current government was capable of solving germany 's health-care issues in the long term . winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel manage to keep the coalition government together ?
the social democrats did slightly better , gaining one percentage point since the last poll , to reach 31 .
but the true winners seems to be the opposition free-market liberal fdp , whose rating rose by 2 percentage points to 13 , their highest rating since at least oct .
1994 . support for the green party remained at 9 percent . merkel 's own ratings fell over the past four weeks , too .
one month ago , the german chancellor placed third on the list of the country 's 10 most important politicians .

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .

the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .

in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2006 german company fined for selling anti-nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen kamm was fined 3,600 euros for his gear a stuttgart court fined a german company that specializes in anti-fascist paraphernalia adorned with swastikas for using the constitutionally banned symbol . how far can individuals go in using a symbol banned by the german constitution ?
it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .
bildunterschrift : leftists will have to pick a more neutral symbol green party leader claudia roth called the case " counterproductive . "
she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .
a hitler salute it is n't the first time that left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis .
last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .

he only issued a press statement saying that a district court judge had sided with his lawyers , who had called for an injunction against media allegations that klippstein served as an informant of east germany 's infamous stasi secret police . " the court agreed with my lawyers , that media coverage about me was illegal and violated my rights , " klippstein wrote , according to german news service dpa . stunning coincidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klippstein inside the hotel 's presidential suite earlier in the week , german public broadcaster ndr had aired a documentary about the famous east german hotel neptun , where western vips had been spied on by the stasi .
according to the documentary , the hotel 's concierge had provided the stasi with information about guests under the code name " benjamin . " according to dpa , the real name of " benjamin " was thomas klippstein .
that man was born march 31 , 1962 and worked at hotel neptun before moving to dresden in 1988 .
the informant 's career path and birth year coincides with that of the current director of hotel adlon , according to news reports .

he joined kempinski in 1993 and held executive positions at hotels in dresden , bangkok , st. petersburg and istanbul before returning to germany in 2001 .
one year later , he became the opening director of the group 's new heiligendamm resort on the baltic sea coast before coming to berlin in 2005 . the adlon , which was destroyed during the war and rebuilt after reunification , has hosted numerous heads of state , who have resided in the hotel 's presidential suite .

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .
for some months now , new taliban forces have been attacking nato-forces , trying to set up reconstruction teams around kandahar .
in the east us-troops are trying to reclaim taliban-infested territory . the move would put isaf in control of international operations across the country , boosting its numbers to more than 30,000 troops - almost half of them us forces - from some 37 nations . it would also permit nato 's commanders to move us soldiers from the east down to the taliban 's southern heartland , where british , dutch and canadian troops have been locked in battle with taliban-led fighters . " expect -lrb- the expansion -rrb- to happen very soon indeed , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told reporters in portoroz , slovenia after the first day of talks . " you have to deliver " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld both us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and scheffer urged the nato allies to do more , amid a general reluctance to supply around 2,000 reinforcements in the south in response to a demand earlier this month by supreme commander us general james jones . " if you are in an alliance based on solidarity , you have to deliver , " scheffer said . poland will speed up its deployment of around 1,000 personnel and is expected to provide many of the combat troops needed in the south .
nato sources said romania , canada , denmark and the czech republic also made offers . hearts and minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan in crisis the taliban , ousted by the us-led military coalition in late 2001 for harboring al qaeda leader osama bin laden , has been backed by allies among drug runners and fighters loyal to local warlords . as it seeks to reclaim taliban-infested territory , isaf also hopes to win hearts and minds by helping build new roads , bridges and schools , as well as provide jobs . but development is lagging and nato 's most ambitious security enterprise faces failure if afghans lose interest in democracy and turn once again to the fundamentalist militia . analysts have suggested that nato 's worst nightmare might well come true , with afghans losing interest in democracy and a state modeled after western values .
if the nato-led international security force does not succeed in providing more efficient security in afghanistan , sources in the alliance say that people will start to support the taliban again . the major challenges include building an afghan police force , fighting corruption and ending the opium trade . " it is winnable but it requires a concerted effort , " said nato spokesman james appathurai , and added : " the international donors , the united nations , the european union , the non-governmental organizations , they all have to step up their game , all of them .

" we have offered iran a broad cooperation , " he told the newspaper die welt friday , adding that the international community was now waiting for iran to declare itself ready to negotiate , but that time was running out .
" iran must make it unambiguously clear that its nuclear programm serves peaceful purposes only , " he said .
no headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana offered iran a western incentives package little headway was made in the seven hours of talks between larijani and the eu 's foreign policy co-ordinator javier solana . " we have made some important progress on the elements of how the potential negotiations can take place , " said solana .
" there are still some important issues that have not been closed . " solana has been given until early october to reach a deal .
otherwise , the us says it will press the un security council for sanctions against iran .
so far , solana 's discussions are n't past the preliminary stage , but he said another round of talks would be held soon . us impatience in washington , us state department spokesman sean mccormack reaffirmed that a new deadline for iranian compliance that was agreed last week among the permanent five un security council members and germany - the so-called p-5-plus-1 nations - was looming and would not be changed . " the timeline that was agreed in new york stays , and we are getting short now in terms of that time , " he said , referring to the moment when the six nations would seek un sanctions against tehran . the deadline has not been officially revealed by the six nations , which also include britain , china , france , russia and the united states , but european diplomats involved in the negotiations said it was sometime next week . " the ball is in their court , " mccormack said thursday of the iranians .
" nobody wants to go down the path of sanctions - that is not our first choice .
but we are prepared , along with the p-5-plus-1 , to go down that path if that 's the door that the iranian regime wants to open , " he said . meanwhile , the us house of representatives approved legislation to ramp up economic pressure on iran in an effort to convince tehran to abandon its nuclear program . republican representative ileana ros-lehtinen , author of the iran freedom support act , said the bill would deny iran " the technical assistance , financial resources , and political legitimacy to develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism . " incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's solana with iran 's ali larijani the eu-iran talks focus on a list of economic and diplomatic incentives put forward by the six powers in june as a reward if iran suspends its uranium enrichment . the incentives include support for an iranian nuclear power industry and the first direct contacts between the us and iran in nearly 30 years . mccormack insisted that negotiations involving the united states could begin only after iran freezes its enrichment program and the suspension is verified by monitors from the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency . the solana-larijani talks were believed to be focussing on the " sequencing " of a possible decision by iran to temporarily suspend enrichment and the subsequent start of full negotiations on the incentives package . european diplomats said larijani has offered a temporary suspension , but it was unclear if the proposal had the support of the various factions within the iranian leadership . the negotiations were given a fresh chance after washington , under pressure from europe and china , backed down on its demand for immediate sanctions against iran for failing to meet the august 31 deadline . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran negotiator sees " positive conclusions " in nuclear talks iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said thursday that two days of talks in berlin with the eu 's foreign policy chief solana had produced " some positive conclusions .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ? " said michael eissenhauer , president of the federation of german museums . " pandora 's box has been opened " bernd lindemann , head of berlin 's prestigious gemäldegalerie art gallery , conjured up a vision worthy of the surrealist school . " if you push the idea to its conclusion you end up with the frightening notion of a completely renovated gallery with nothing in it to put on show , " said lindemann . olaf zimmermann of the hallowed german cultural council summed it up in doom-laden tones : " a pandora 's box has been opened . " the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ?

the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers .

" the canvas , one of a series by monet depicting the houses of parliament in london -lrb- " maisons du parlement à londres " -rrb- , is on show at krefeld 's kaiser wilhelm museum , which urgently needs five million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- for major repairs and renovation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monet 's own garden was apparently an artistic inspiration " the roof is leaking and the air conditioning has to be completely replaced , " said roland schneider , head of the culture department at city hall .
" it was so hot this july we had to take down some of the paintings on exhibition and put them into storage . " painting worth more than repairs the monet is valued at between 18 and 20 millions euros -lrb- $ 23 to 25 million -rrb- , much more than needed to carry out repairs . however the gallery , dating from 1899 , has not been renovated since the 1960s and staff dream not only of much-needed repairs , but of state-of-the-art modernization with more exhibition space , all entailing a budget of an estimated 11 million euros . " this is a violation of an absolute taboo , " said eissenhauer .
" if we fritter away our cultural heritage , how will we preserve our cultural identity ? " overwhelmed by the unexpected barrage of protest , the city hall in krefeld has beaten a hasty retreat , trying to appease enraged culture czars with assurances that the monet sale must first be approved by the regional authorities of north rhine-westphalia , that it is in any case no more than an " idea " at this stage , and that nothing so far has been decided . more museum visitors than ever the town council itself is divided over the issue .
the opposition social democrats and greens are against the sale , the free market liberal free democrats are in favor of it . meanwhile the christian democratic mayor , gregor kathstede , has n't said what he prefers . " we would have liked to ponder the matter calmly , away from all the media pressures , " said roland schneider of city hall 's culture department . yet there is an upside to all this sudden stress in otherwise quiet krefeld .
the media attention has put the kaiser wilhelm museum - annual average visitor figures hitherto 20,000 to 45,000 - in the limelight as never before , and the number of visitors curious about the overlooked monet has leapt suddenly and gratifyingly to quite unprecedented levels . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden museum czar rails against spending cuts the director of saxony 's famed staatliche kunstsammlungen dresden harshly criticized the state for tightening the screws on its museum funding .

' this is worse than anything we could have expected .
morally the former owners siemens are responsible for the disaster , " mueller told german news agency dpa . it was no secret that all was not well at benq , taiwan 's largest mobile phone maker .
the company , which produces projectors and digital music players as well , had also announced last week that it would halt production at its only factory in taiwan . after taking over the siemens business last year , benq aimed to secure at least 10 percent of the world market , but at the last count this figure was just 3 percent . management was also not hopeful regarding the vital christmas season . employees shocked and angered by news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq took over siemens ' mobile section in 2005 workers at the munich headquarters , where 1,400 are employed , suspected bad news when they were called to an " all-hands-meeting " thursday .

" we have offered iran a broad cooperation , " he told the newspaper die welt friday , adding that the international community was now waiting for iran to declare itself ready to negotiate , but that time was running out .
" iran must make it unambiguously clear that its nuclear programm serves peaceful purposes only , " he said .

but suddenly it finds itself drenched in unwelcome limelight over a painting by the french impressionist master of which it has been the quietly proud and uncontroversial owner for almost exactly a century , since 1907 . until the roof began to leak . the idea of selling the pride of the collection to preserve the rest has caused outrage among the good and the great . " would anyone ever hit on the idea of selling off the trolley cars to repair a streetcar network or flog the books in a library to repair the roof ?

the mandate allows up to 3000 bundeswehr soldiers to be deployed as part of isaf . but german defense minster franz-josef jung promised that the troops would not be deployed in the troubled south of the country - although nato allies are pressing germany to lift this restriction . security concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's deployment to southern afghanistan will be a challenging ground mission .
five years after ousting the taliban regime in afghanistan , us-troops and nato peace-keepers are still not able to provide security for the entire country . since the beginning of the year , taliban and terrorists have killed 100 foreign soldiers and about 2000 civilians .

it was just this question that the stuttgart district attorney 's office wanted clarified when it brought a case against nix gut , a mail-order company that offers left-wing garb adorned with modified swastikas .
the swastika is banned as a symbol of an unconstitutional organization , but german law allows its use if it is clearly in a form indicating opposition to national socialism .
a crossed-out swastika reminiscent of a no-parking sign or a stick person throwing a swastika into a garbage can are images often used by the left-wing movement in germany .
but a judge ruled on friday that the use of the nazi symbol by the company violated the law and fined the owner , jürgen kamm , 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,500 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials fear that neo-nazis could skirt the ban " it is not always so easy to recognize that these symbols are being used against nazis , especially for foreigners , " said bernhard häussler , the district attorney said .
circumventing a ban up to now , the justice system in the state of baden-württemberg , where the case was tried , handled this problem differently , on a case by case basis .
but stuttgart wanted legal clarity , fearing that if leftists could get away with using the symbol , then neo-nazis might also find a way around the ban .
thus , the district attorney brought the suit against kamm .
" there 's a danger that the use of swastikas , even in a modified manner , will not be removed from our society , " said the prosecutor .
" so neo-nazis could use them for their own means and this should under no circumstances be the case .
we want to avoid a situation where the use of these symbols once again becomes normal . "
but kamm has defended the use of the symbol saying that it is clear they are being used in a manner that is opposed to right-wing extremism .
he added that he will appeal the case to the federal court of justice .
bildunterschrift : leftists will have to pick a more neutral symbol green party leader claudia roth called the case " counterproductive . "
she had previously reported herself to the police for wearing a button featuring a crossed-out swastika after the case was initially made against kamm .
a hitler salute it is n't the first time that left-wing supporters have been criminalized for their actions aimed at protesting against neo-nazis .
last year , a student in tübingen was fined for wearing an anti-nazi button on his backpack .
the local court had argued that a japanese tourist would only see the swastika and would n't recognize the crossed-out symbol as an anti-fascist pictogram .
the student subsequently won his appeal before a regional court , which ruled that he was clearly expressing his anti-fascist attitude by wearing the button .
in another case , nigerian soccer player adebowale ogungbure , who plays for sachsen leipzig made a mock hitler salute to fans in halle after being subjected to racist taunts .
the player was charged for the action , but prosecutors eventually dropped the charges , because he had been provoked and had n't understood the gesture was illegal .

that is the worst result that germany 's largest conservative parties have had in regular opinion polls since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the historic low in opinion polls for the christian democrats is seen as a consequence of the ongoing debate in the grand coalition government about the reform of the country 's health-care system .
amidst the continuous disagreements between cdu / csu and its coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , 83 percent of those polled said they did n't believe the current government was capable of solving germany 's health-care issues in the long term . winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel manage to keep the coalition government together ?

today , only 52 percent of voters rated merkel 's assertiveness positively . the overall popularity of the government is on the decline as well .
almost one year ago , the coalition of social democrats and christian democrats was supported by 52 percent of germans .
today , their ratings are down to 33 percent . sixty-five percent of germans believe that relations between the grand coalition partners are mostly bad - a 14 percent drop since the beginning of september . the survey was conducted between sept .

in recent attention-grabbing headlines , illegal immigrants to europe accused greek authorities of dumping them into the sea off the coast of turkey , where some drowned . also , mounting pressure from illegal immigration has led french and spanish politicians to exchanged angry words on the subject . spain on the front lines spain sees itself in the front line of the battle against illegal immigrants .
it is desperate for assistance to help cope with the huge wave of arrivals - 25,000 this year alone - currently overwhelming authorities in the canary islands . on friday in madrid , ministers from eight countries - spain , france , portugal , italy , greece , malta , cyprus and slovenia - will be joined by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and ritva viljanen , state secretary for the interior ministry from eu presidency holder finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner franco frattini will be on hand in madrid franco frattini and benita ferrero-waldner , european commissioners for justice and security and external relations respectively , will also be present , as will the director of frontex , the eu 's stretched external-border agency . spain is expected to propose a joint european strategy for its southern maritime borders that would serve as a basis for discussions at an informal european summit on oct .

the aim is to increase the country 's low birth rate . the german parliament on friday passed new legislation aiming to raise one of the lowest birth rates in europe by allowing parents to take paid leave to look after newborn children . the parents of children born after jan .
1 , 2007 who have stopped work to look after the child will receive 67 percent of their net salary up to a ceiling of 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,280 -rrb- a month for a year . that could be extended to 14 months if the father undertakes the childcare for at least two months .
or if both parents want to be off work simultaneously , they can each receive the payment for seven months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe parents can also benefit from the new measure if they work less than 30 hours a month .
the payments will be increased by 10 percent for each additional child aged under six years in the household . ' historic ' " this is historic , " said family minister ursula von der leyen , herself a mother of seven and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats .

mr kerkorian , who 's investment firm tracinda already owns 56 million gm shares , or 9.9 % of the firm , has been a vocal critic of the gm board .
his announcement comes as gm continues discussions over a possible alliance with renault and nissan .
some analysts think mr kerkorian wants to pressure gm to speed up the talks .
' undervalued asset ' gerald meyers , a former chairman of american motors , said mr kerkorian was trying to reinvigorate gm 's discussions with france 's renault and japan 's nissan .
mr kerkorian 's tracinda said in a filing with the us regulators that it " continues to believe that a strong opportunity exists in a potential alliance between gm , renault and nissan " .
it added that it thought " there should be strong general motors board involvement in the analysis of such a potential alliance " .
yet other analysts speculated that mr kerkorian simply recognised that gm 's turnaround efforts are now starting to gather speed and that buying additional stock in the firm represented a good investment .
" it 's -lsb- gm stock -rsb- a very undervalued asset , he 's smart enough to recognise this , " said david cole , chairman of the centre for automotive research .
" he 's not buying to lose money . "
gm is trying to turn around its fortunes in the face of weak sales in the us and continuing losses .
back in july , it announced that its second-quarter losses widened to $ 3.2bn -lrb- £ 1.7bn -rrb- from $ 987m in 2005 .

mr kerkorian , who 's investment firm tracinda already owns 56 million gm shares , or 9.9 % of the firm , has been a vocal critic of the gm board .
his announcement comes as gm continues discussions over a possible alliance with renault and nissan .
some analysts think mr kerkorian wants to pressure gm to speed up the talks .
' undervalued asset ' gerald meyers , a former chairman of american motors , said mr kerkorian was trying to reinvigorate gm 's discussions with france 's renault and japan 's nissan .
mr kerkorian 's tracinda said in a filing with the us regulators that it " continues to believe that a strong opportunity exists in a potential alliance between gm , renault and nissan " .
it added that it thought " there should be strong general motors board involvement in the analysis of such a potential alliance " .
yet other analysts speculated that mr kerkorian simply recognised that gm 's turnaround efforts are now starting to gather speed and that buying additional stock in the firm represented a good investment .
" it 's -lsb- gm stock -rsb- a very undervalued asset , he 's smart enough to recognise this , " said david cole , chairman of the centre for automotive research .
" he 's not buying to lose money . "
gm is trying to turn around its fortunes in the face of weak sales in the us and continuing losses .
back in july , it announced that its second-quarter losses widened to $ 3.2bn -lrb- £ 1.7bn -rrb- from $ 987m in 2005 .

the implications of these regulations will be wide-ranging .
employers must ensure that all areas of the employment cycle - recruitment , training and development , promotion , redundancy and retirement - operate without an age bias .
the federation of small businesses has warned that many smaller companies are unprepared for the new regulations and as a result could find themselves facing costly legal claims .
in ireland , which has had age discrimination legislation in place since 1998 , 22 % of all discrimination cases are brought on age grounds . "

many fsb members settle out of court to avoid defence costs , even though they feel they have a good case .
for the smallest businesses , losing a case at tribunal can mean the difference between business survival and failure .
what will the regulations mean ?
it will be illegal to discriminate on the basis of age unless there is a genuine occupational requirement , for example that bar staff serving alcohol must be at least 18 , or if there is an objective justification .
the test of ' objective justification ' , means employers will have to show with evidence that they are pursuing a legitimate aim and that ageism is an appropriate and necessary means of achieving that aim .
there will be a national default retirement age of 65 and any dismissal for retirement at an earlier age will be unlawful unless justified .
retirement at 65 will only be lawful if the correct procedure including a ' duty to consider a request to continue working ' has been followed .
where an extension of work is agreed , the duty to consider will remain in place when retirement is next considered .
not following this procedure could result in compensation of up to eight weeks pay or an automatically unfair dismissal , depending on the extent of the failure .
job adverts extreme care will also have to be taken when advertising job vacancies .
businesses will have to consider where advertisements are placed in case this could effectively exclude a particular age group .
they will have to ensure that the wording used in advertisements does not give the impression that applicants from a particular age group will be favoured such as by asking for a " mature " or " young and dynamic " person .
certain qualification requirements could also have a discriminatory effect - for example , asking for relatively recently created qualifications , such as media studies .
many will view this as just another area in which red tape and over-regulation is tightening its grip on the uk 's small businesses .
the reality is that large organisations have the capacity and resources to continually monitor regulatory developments and adapt their businesses practices to suit .
small businesses - many without any specialist human resources support whatsoever - do not .
not ready yet it is therefore unsurprising that worrying numbers of businesses are not ready for the age laws and could find themselves in trouble once october has passed . "
small businesses could face costly legal action " in a survey carried out by the fsb , 14 % of members responding were completely unaware of the regulations and almost a quarter were aware of the regulations but did not understand what they would mean for their businesses .
this echoes findings of new research by the age partnership group , which represents business , trade unions and government , relating to the recruitment , training and retention of older workers in uk businesses .
the age partnership group investigated nine sectors of the economy .
it found that eight of the sectors relied on length of experience when fixing salaries and in the selection and retention of staff , while seven of the sectors used age or length of service as a basis for making decisions about redundancies .

many small businesses rely on older worker 's skills and experience .
flexible retirement is already common in smaller businesses , alongside more informal working practices that suit workers towards the ends of their careers .
however the uk regulations go further than the european directive requires .
the real risk is that the complexity of these regulations and the new bureaucratic retirement process will mean that small businesses could face costly legal action .

many small businesses are ignorant of the new laws , says alan tyrrell the implications of these regulations will be wide-ranging .
employers must ensure that all areas of the employment cycle - recruitment , training and development , promotion , redundancy and retirement - operate without an age bias .
the federation of small businesses has warned that many smaller companies are unprepared for the new regulations and as a result could find themselves facing costly legal claims .
in ireland , which has had age discrimination legislation in place since 1998 , 22 % of all discrimination cases are brought on age grounds .
extreme care will also have to be taken when advertising job vacancies quick guide : age discrimination already applications to employment tribunals under existing employment legislation have nearly trebled in the uk over the past 10 years .
many fsb members settle out of court to avoid defence costs , even though they feel they have a good case .
for the smallest businesses , losing a case at tribunal can mean the difference between business survival and failure .
what will the regulations mean ?
it will be illegal to discriminate on the basis of age unless there is a genuine occupational requirement , for example that bar staff serving alcohol must be at least 18 , or if there is an objective justification .
the test of ' objective justification ' , means employers will have to show with evidence that they are pursuing a legitimate aim and that ageism is an appropriate and necessary means of achieving that aim .
there will be a national default retirement age of 65 and any dismissal for retirement at an earlier age will be unlawful unless justified .
retirement at 65 will only be lawful if the correct procedure including a ' duty to consider a request to continue working ' has been followed .
where an extension of work is agreed , the duty to consider will remain in place when retirement is next considered .
not following this procedure could result in compensation of up to eight weeks pay or an automatically unfair dismissal , depending on the extent of the failure .
job adverts extreme care will also have to be taken when advertising job vacancies .
it will be more difficult to force older workers to retire businesses will have to consider where advertisements are placed in case this could effectively exclude a particular age group .
they will have to ensure that the wording used in advertisements does not give the impression that applicants from a particular age group will be favoured such as by asking for a " mature " or " young and dynamic " person .
certain qualification requirements could also have a discriminatory effect - for example , asking for relatively recently created qualifications , such as media studies .
many will view this as just another area in which red tape and over-regulation is tightening its grip on the uk 's small businesses .
the reality is that large organisations have the capacity and resources to continually monitor regulatory developments and adapt their businesses practices to suit .
small businesses - many without any specialist human resources support whatsoever - do not .
not ready yet it is therefore unsurprising that worrying numbers of businesses are not ready for the age laws and could find themselves in trouble once october has passed .
small businesses could face costly legal action in a survey carried out by the fsb , 14 % of members responding were completely unaware of the regulations and almost a quarter were aware of the regulations but did not understand what they would mean for their businesses .
this echoes findings of new research by the age partnership group , which represents business , trade unions and government , relating to the recruitment , training and retention of older workers in uk businesses .
the age partnership group investigated nine sectors of the economy .
it found that eight of the sectors relied on length of experience when fixing salaries and in the selection and retention of staff , while seven of the sectors used age or length of service as a basis for making decisions about redundancies .
complexity no honest employer would advocate intentionally discriminatory practices and the business case for an age diverse workforce is clear .
many small businesses rely on older worker 's skills and experience .
flexible retirement is already common in smaller businesses , alongside more informal working practices that suit workers towards the ends of their careers .
however the uk regulations go further than the european directive requires .
the real risk is that the complexity of these regulations and the new bureaucratic retirement process will mean that small businesses could face costly legal action .
this might not be for genuinely discriminatory behaviour but for an administrative or procedural mistake or minor misunderstanding of the law .
ultimately , this could be detrimental to the uk economy and not true to the spirit in which the law is intended .

brendan barber , tuc general secretary thanks to europe the government has now introduced regulations that for the first time in the uk give workers protection against age discrimination .
whatever their age , workers now have important protection against discrimination and ageism .
that applies whether they are applying for a job or a promotion , concerned about their pay rates , taking advantage of workplace benefits such as holidays , redundancy or pensions , or considering their retirement options .
students and others taking training courses may be protected from age discrimination , if , for example , colleges or training providers unfairly give preference to those of certain ages and not others .
age-based harassment is also banned by the regulations .
this is defined as any unwanted conduct that violates your dignity or creates an intimidating , hostile , degrading , humiliating or offensive environment for you .
this is probably a lot less common than sexual or racial harassment .
but if you are repeatedly taunted for being " an ugly old wrinkly " , you would have a legal claim against not just those insulting you , but also your employer for allowing it to happen .
this could include damages for injury to feelings .
common prejudice while age-based harassment may be rare , surveys tell us that age discrimination is the most common type of prejudice at work .
the regulations are not perfect , and are not always clear about what will and wo n't be allowed quick guide : age discrimination the recent tuc report " ready , willing and able " found that a million 50-65 year olds want work but ca n't find it .
less than a half of people in this age group without jobs have retired " fully voluntarily " .
in some sectors you are thought to be over the hill well before 50 unless you are lucky enough to have become a top manager .
at the other end of the age range , young workers often face lower pay rates and stereotypical views about their inexperience or reliability .
but while the new law is real progress , the regulations are not perfect and are not always clear about what will and wo n't be allowed .
so while it is pretty clear that you can not give people some extra holiday simply because they are over 40 , you will probably have to go to an employment tribunal to challenge an employer that gives training to younger staff .
and there are arguments that employers can use to justify different treatment for different age groups .
employer rights the government is also allowing employers to continue to make people retire , even if they want to stay in their job and can do it perfectly adequately .
under the regulations there is only a right to request to stay on beyond 65 .
the employer has an absolute right to say no .
many legal experts think this breaks the european law from which these regulations flow , and at least one legal challenge is to be mounted in the courts .
it is also disappointing that the government did not use the new regulations to improve statutory redundancy pay .
it could have replaced the existing system of different redundancy pay for different age groups with a new higher rate for all , recognising how much its value has fallen in recent years .
the national minimum wage will also continue to be lower for 18-21 year olds .
legal risks our message to employers is that they should not wait to see how the courts interpret some of the complicated detail of the regulations but make sure that all their policies are as age neutral as possible .
age discrimination is quite simply unfair , and bad for business many employers already have a progressive approach , and unions have been busy negotiating changes that will make sure that the spirit as well as the letter of the law is met .
we are working with employers ' organisations to provide detailed guidance on how to do this .
those who do not will risk expensive and difficult court cases , and with the distinct possibility that difficult cases will end up resolved in the european court of justice several years down the line , so it is better to be safe than sorry .
and if you are an employee who thinks you have been discriminated against because of your age , you should contact your union or an advice agency to seek help as you may now have the law on your side .
age discrimination is quite simply unfair , and bad for business .
unions will be making sure that the new law makes a difference .
it is time to end this huge source of unfair discrimination once and for all .

brendan barber , tuc general secretary thanks to europe the government has now introduced regulations that for the first time in the uk give workers protection against age discrimination .
whatever their age , workers now have important protection against discrimination and ageism .
that applies whether they are applying for a job or a promotion , concerned about their pay rates , taking advantage of workplace benefits such as holidays , redundancy or pensions , or considering their retirement options .
students and others taking training courses may be protected from age discrimination , if , for example , colleges or training providers unfairly give preference to those of certain ages and not others .
age-based harassment is also banned by the regulations .
this is defined as any unwanted conduct that violates your dignity or creates an intimidating , hostile , degrading , humiliating or offensive environment for you .
this is probably a lot less common than sexual or racial harassment .
but if you are repeatedly taunted for being " an ugly old wrinkly " , you would have a legal claim against not just those insulting you , but also your employer for allowing it to happen .
this could include damages for injury to feelings .
common prejudice while age-based harassment may be rare , surveys tell us that age discrimination is the most common type of prejudice at work .
the regulations are not perfect , and are not always clear about what will and wo n't be allowed quick guide : age discrimination the recent tuc report " ready , willing and able " found that a million 50-65 year olds want work but ca n't find it .
less than a half of people in this age group without jobs have retired " fully voluntarily " .
in some sectors you are thought to be over the hill well before 50 unless you are lucky enough to have become a top manager .
at the other end of the age range , young workers often face lower pay rates and stereotypical views about their inexperience or reliability .
but while the new law is real progress , the regulations are not perfect and are not always clear about what will and wo n't be allowed .
so while it is pretty clear that you can not give people some extra holiday simply because they are over 40 , you will probably have to go to an employment tribunal to challenge an employer that gives training to younger staff .
and there are arguments that employers can use to justify different treatment for different age groups .
employer rights the government is also allowing employers to continue to make people retire , even if they want to stay in their job and can do it perfectly adequately .
under the regulations there is only a right to request to stay on beyond 65 .
the employer has an absolute right to say no .
many legal experts think this breaks the european law from which these regulations flow , and at least one legal challenge is to be mounted in the courts .
it is also disappointing that the government did not use the new regulations to improve statutory redundancy pay .
it could have replaced the existing system of different redundancy pay for different age groups with a new higher rate for all , recognising how much its value has fallen in recent years .
the national minimum wage will also continue to be lower for 18-21 year olds .
legal risks our message to employers is that they should not wait to see how the courts interpret some of the complicated detail of the regulations but make sure that all their policies are as age neutral as possible .
age discrimination is quite simply unfair , and bad for business many employers already have a progressive approach , and unions have been busy negotiating changes that will make sure that the spirit as well as the letter of the law is met .
we are working with employers ' organisations to provide detailed guidance on how to do this .
those who do not will risk expensive and difficult court cases , and with the distinct possibility that difficult cases will end up resolved in the european court of justice several years down the line , so it is better to be safe than sorry .
and if you are an employee who thinks you have been discriminated against because of your age , you should contact your union or an advice agency to seek help as you may now have the law on your side .
age discrimination is quite simply unfair , and bad for business .
unions will be making sure that the new law makes a difference .
it is time to end this huge source of unfair discrimination once and for all .

but the opposite may be true .
while the new employment equality -lrb- age -rrb- regulations 2006 may benefit some age groups , they will actually help employers retire their older employees and legally allow them to refuse job applicants who are over the age of 65 .
older people are increasingly feeling the need to stay in employment because of financial considerations such as pension issues , supporting their children through university and helping their offspring get a foot on the property ladder .
on the surface the new regulations appear to create opportunities for those who wish to continue working beyond retirement . "
an employer does not even have to give written reasons for refusing an employee 's request to continue working beyond 65 " quick guide : age discrimination employers will not be able to enforce a retirement age lower than 65 , unless it can be objectively justified .
those approaching retirement age are also granted the right to request to continue working for their employer beyond retirement .
but there is nothing in the legislation to encourage employers to take on or retain people of 65 or over .
in fact , part of the regulations specifically enables employers to refuse job applicants if they are over the retirement age - or even if they are within six months of the retirement age .
no obligation whilst every employer has a duty to consider an employee request to continue working beyond retirement , there is no obligation on an employer to grant it .
an employer does not even have to give written reasons for refusing an employee 's request to continue working beyond 65 .
furthermore , the new law actually appears to incentivise employers not to employ staff beyond 65 by making it potentially costly to do so .
age discrimination legislation will introduce new rights so that older employees who are kept on past 65 will enjoy the same benefits as the rest of the workforce .
this includes statutory redundancy pay and statutory sick pay .
rare circumstances other benefits given to younger staff will also have to be extended to older employees , such as life insurance and private medical insurance .
only in certain rare circumstances will it be possible to justify not providing them .
a new right for employees over 65 to claim unfair dismissal will make it more difficult and potentially more costly for employers to dismiss staff .
as such , an employer could see employing this age group as an expensive risk they are not willing to take . "
although age discrimination legislation will have benefits for all age groups , technically it provides employers with a get-out clause when it comes to the employment of older employees " if the over 65s will not benefit from the new regulations , is there any age group who will benefit ?
significant benefits a significant age group to experience benefits are those in their 40s and 50s .
frequently discriminated against because of age , employees in this age group are often overlooked for training and promotion and may be first in line in the event of redundancies .
once unemployed it may also be difficult for them to find new employment when competing with ' fresh young graduates ' .
but after october it will be unlawful to use age as a factor in any employment decision , such as promotion , training , pay and redundancy .
for example , employers wo n't be able to offer training only to younger employees because you " ca n't teach old dogs new tricks " , or dismiss an employee for being " too old for the job " .
this may mean a demographic shift in some sectors more than others , for example the traditionally youthful professions of advertising and marketing .
age-neutral language whilst it is currently legal to advertise for " young " , " energetic " and " enthusiastic " recruits , the new legislation will enforce age-neutral language in job advertisements .
it will also no longer be lawful to consider a person 's age during recruitment , other than for monitoring purposes .
it is crucial for employers to be aware that , even though they will not be forced to keep on employees over the age of 65 , they will need to make changes to combat discrimination against all ages .
this will involve a comprehensive assessment of employment policies such as those concerning recruitment and equal opportunities , and providing employees with adequate training to implement them .
although age discrimination legislation will have benefits for all age groups , technically it provides employers with a get-out clause when it comes to the employment of older employees , failing those who , many would argue , need the most protection .

but the opposite may be true .
while the new employment equality -lrb- age -rrb- regulations 2006 may benefit some age groups , they will actually help employers retire their older employees and legally allow them to refuse job applicants who are over the age of 65 .
older people are increasingly feeling the need to stay in employment because of financial considerations such as pension issues , supporting their children through university and helping their offspring get a foot on the property ladder .
on the surface the new regulations appear to create opportunities for those who wish to continue working beyond retirement .
an employer does not even have to give written reasons for refusing an employee 's request to continue working beyond 65 quick guide : age discrimination employers will not be able to enforce a retirement age lower than 65 , unless it can be objectively justified .
those approaching retirement age are also granted the right to request to continue working for their employer beyond retirement .
but there is nothing in the legislation to encourage employers to take on or retain people of 65 or over .
in fact , part of the regulations specifically enables employers to refuse job applicants if they are over the retirement age - or even if they are within six months of the retirement age .
no obligation whilst every employer has a duty to consider an employee request to continue working beyond retirement , there is no obligation on an employer to grant it .
an employer does not even have to give written reasons for refusing an employee 's request to continue working beyond 65 .
furthermore , the new law actually appears to incentivise employers not to employ staff beyond 65 by making it potentially costly to do so .
age discrimination legislation will introduce new rights so that older employees who are kept on past 65 will enjoy the same benefits as the rest of the workforce .
this includes statutory redundancy pay and statutory sick pay .
rare circumstances other benefits given to younger staff will also have to be extended to older employees , such as life insurance and private medical insurance .
only in certain rare circumstances will it be possible to justify not providing them .
a new right for employees over 65 to claim unfair dismissal will make it more difficult and potentially more costly for employers to dismiss staff .
as such , an employer could see employing this age group as an expensive risk they are not willing to take .
although age discrimination legislation will have benefits for all age groups , technically it provides employers with a get-out clause when it comes to the employment of older employees if the over 65s will not benefit from the new regulations , is there any age group who will benefit ?
significant benefits a significant age group to experience benefits are those in their 40s and 50s .
frequently discriminated against because of age , employees in this age group are often overlooked for training and promotion and may be first in line in the event of redundancies .
once unemployed it may also be difficult for them to find new employment when competing with ' fresh young graduates ' .
but after october it will be unlawful to use age as a factor in any employment decision , such as promotion , training , pay and redundancy .
for example , employers wo n't be able to offer training only to younger employees because you " ca n't teach old dogs new tricks " , or dismiss an employee for being " too old for the job " .
this may mean a demographic shift in some sectors more than others , for example the traditionally youthful professions of advertising and marketing .
age-neutral language whilst it is currently legal to advertise for " young " , " energetic " and " enthusiastic " recruits , the new legislation will enforce age-neutral language in job advertisements .
it will also no longer be lawful to consider a person 's age during recruitment , other than for monitoring purposes .
it is crucial for employers to be aware that , even though they will not be forced to keep on employees over the age of 65 , they will need to make changes to combat discrimination against all ages .
this will involve a comprehensive assessment of employment policies such as those concerning recruitment and equal opportunities , and providing employees with adequate training to implement them .
although age discrimination legislation will have benefits for all age groups , technically it provides employers with a get-out clause when it comes to the employment of older employees , failing those who , many would argue , need the most protection .

the government is determined to stamp out ageism , says anne mcguire for too long people have found it difficult to get work , and been passed over for training and promotion , because of their age .
but many people , including employers , are unaware that the practice of ageism is also bad for business .
as an employer you could be increasing your recruitment and retention costs , and preventing yourself from getting and keeping the best person for the job .
the government is determined to tackle all forms of discrimination in the workplace , and is introducing legislation to protect the rights of workers regardless of criteria such as age .
the new laws from 1 october , age discrimination in employment and vocational training will be outlawed .
if we are truly to succeed , the myths that drive age discrimination in the workplace must be dispelled anne mcguire quick guide : age discrimination the new measures will apply to both the private and public sectors , and will cover every member of the workforce , young and old .
in short , all employers will be required to review their employment practices to ensure they are based on skills and competencies , rather than age .
so , for example , nobody will be allowed to recruit , train , promote or retire people on the basis of age , unless it can be objectively justified .
it is hugely important that employers are aware of these changes and that is why we have set up the age partnership group -lrb- apg -rrb- campaign .
one of the apg 's responsibilities has been to draw up a list of top tips to help employers in advance of the legislation .
they include simple ideas such as removing age limits from recruitment advertisements , avoiding age " cut-offs " for promotion , offering training to employees of all ages , and agreeing a fair and consistent retirement policy .
new attitudes needed these tips will go a long way in helping employers improve their employment practices .
they will make things better for business and better for workers .
but advice like this , even when backed by legislation , can only go so far .
we must also do as much as possible to change attitudes , not just behaviour .
if we are truly to succeed , the myths that drive age discrimination in the workplace must be dispelled .
those myths , along with the corresponding reality , were listed in recent research by the health and safety laboratory .
ridding ourselves of these myths and establishing more accurate and positive attitudes is another key objective of the apg campaign .
the group can provide all employers with a range of free information products to help them improve their understanding of age positive practices and to prepare for 1 october .
the opinions expressed are those of the author and are not held by the bbc unless specifically stated .

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news a new mobile phone tv service lets viewers watch bbc one and itv1 live on the move .
mobile tv is coming of age - but how well does it work ?
and will it catch on ?
it is approaching two o 'clock and on neighbours , paul is recovering from a shocking murder attempt and karl and susan are embroiled in a passionate affair .
i am on the bus with the new virgin mobile lobster phone - the first to receive the main uk tv channels - in my lap .
the screen is only about 4cm -lrb- 1.5in -rrb- wide , the picture is a little grainy and jerky and the sound is occasionally out of sync .
it is harder work to watch than a normal tv .
but if there is something worth watching , it is definitely watchable .
the virgin mobile service , powered by bt movio , carries bbc one , itv1 , e4 and a slimmed-down version of channel 4 .
it is free on contracts over £ 25 a month - otherwise , users must pay for the phone and a monthly subscription .
it is the latest in a string of mobile tv launches , with a monthly fee the norm .
on vodafone , the likes of sky news and at the races are live , alongside mobile versions of about 25 other channels - including mtv , sky one and nickelodeon .
testing that service on the bus , a few teething problems and error messages prevent me watching impossible bridges - denmark to sweden on national geographic and , more disappointingly , lost sneak peek on channel 4 .
i do manage to connect to the paramount comedy channel - the picture quality is similar to the virgin mobile service , but unfortunately the show is not very funny .
like any tv service , reception is key .
the vodafone system uses the 3g phone network , which covers 72 % of the uk , while virgin mobile use the dab digital radio frequency , which has 85 % coverage .
back on the bus the next day , the vodafone service behaves and it is possible to watch keith chegwin hurtling around a cul-de-sac on gmtv .
viewed on a mobile handset , it looks suspiciously like he is about to carry out a happy slap attack , but luckily he hands over a £ 10,000 cheque instead .
orange , three , o2 and t-mobile have also launched mobile video services , with most operators now offering a choice of channels and downloadable video clips .
on orange , clips of comedy shows like little britain and the office can be downloaded for 50-75p for less than two minutes .
a coronation street catch-up , meanwhile , costs 25p for a one-minute round-up of last night 's action .
' snackable ' shows escaping into a bit of comedy or catching up on last night 's tv on the way home is an attractive option .
but regularly whiling away my bus journeys this way could become an expensive habit .
snacking is a word often used when describing mobile tv viewing habits , and " snackable " shows are considered by many in the industry to be the way ahead .
commuting and lunch breaks have been popular times for people to tune in on their handsets , while some also use them as back-up tv sets at home .
but mobile tv is really expected to draw in the viewers when a big event - such as a major news story or a big brother final - is on . "
it 's just a way of untethering your tv experience and complementing what you 've got at home " nick white virgin mobile " it is partly when you 're out and about and not at a normal television , then you can dip into stuff like that , " says vodafone 's jonathan bill .
" but equally we also see quite good usage when people probably would have access to a tv - in the evening as well . "
nick white of virgin mobile says customers will use mobiles to watch the end of programmes after they leave the house or catch the start of a show before they get home .
it is an " extension " of the normal tv experience , he says .
" in no way is it a substitute .
it 's just a way of untethering your tv experience and complementing what you 've got at home . "
home-made videos patrick parodi , chairman of the mobile entertainment forum , says mobile video is currently a priority for phone companies and broadcasters - but they must understand how to get the most out of it .
" there 's nothing about a mobile phone that resembles a television set , " he says .
" i think the industry needs to be aware that the mechanics and user behaviour when using a mobile phone are much , much different than sitting in front of the tv . "
that behaviour includes creating video as well as watching it , with services such as see me tv on the three network and o2 's lookatme allowing users to upload their own clips .
" it 's a bit like youtube , except you get paid if people watch it , " explains tim green , executive editor of mobile entertainment magazine .
" so some people are making a few hundred quid a month from this .
but they tend to be girls taking their tops off . "
mobile video still has a long way to go before it really takes off , he says , because the offering is " not great " and parts are " still pretty embryonic " .
as for my bus journeys , i may be tempted to tune in for a big news story , a huge event or a must-see show .
my trusty radio may not be quite as cutting-edge - but for now , it is still less hassle and less costly .

but mobile tv is really expected to draw in the viewers when a big event - such as a major news story or a big brother final - is on .
it 's just a way of untethering your tv experience and complementing what you 've got at home nick white virgin mobile " it is partly when you 're out and about and not at a normal television , then you can dip into stuff like that , " says vodafone 's jonathan bill .
" but equally we also see quite good usage when people probably would have access to a tv - in the evening as well . "
nick white of virgin mobile says customers will use mobiles to watch the end of programmes after they leave the house or catch the start of a show before they get home .
it is an " extension " of the normal tv experience , he says .
" in no way is it a substitute .
it 's just a way of untethering your tv experience and complementing what you 've got at home . "
home-made videos patrick parodi , chairman of the mobile entertainment forum , says mobile video is currently a priority for phone companies and broadcasters - but they must understand how to get the most out of it .
" there 's nothing about a mobile phone that resembles a television set , " he says .
" i think the industry needs to be aware that the mechanics and user behaviour when using a mobile phone are much , much different than sitting in front of the tv . "
mobile tv is constantly developing - but will it really take off ?
that behaviour includes creating video as well as watching it , with services such as see me tv on the three network and o2 's lookatme allowing users to upload their own clips .
" it 's a bit like youtube , except you get paid if people watch it , " explains tim green , executive editor of mobile entertainment magazine .
" so some people are making a few hundred quid a month from this .
but they tend to be girls taking their tops off . "
mobile video still has a long way to go before it really takes off , he says , because the offering is " not great " and parts are " still pretty embryonic " .
as for my bus journeys , i may be tempted to tune in for a big news story , a huge event or a must-see show .
my trusty radio may not be quite as cutting-edge - but for now , it is still less hassle and less costly .

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news a new mobile phone tv service lets viewers watch bbc one and itv1 live on the move .
mobile tv is coming of age - but how well does it work ?
and will it catch on ?
virgin mobile 's lobster phone is the first to carry bbc one and itv1 it is approaching two o 'clock and on neighbours , paul is recovering from a shocking murder attempt and karl and susan are embroiled in a passionate affair .
i am on the bus with the new virgin mobile lobster phone - the first to receive the main uk tv channels - in my lap .
the screen is only about 4cm -lrb- 1.5in -rrb- wide , the picture is a little grainy and jerky and the sound is occasionally out of sync .
it is harder work to watch than a normal tv .
but if there is something worth watching , it is definitely watchable .
the virgin mobile service , powered by bt movio , carries bbc one , itv1 , e4 and a slimmed-down version of channel 4 .
it is free on contracts over £ 25 a month - otherwise , users must pay for the phone and a monthly subscription .
it is the latest in a string of mobile tv launches , with a monthly fee the norm .
on vodafone , the likes of sky news and at the races are live , alongside mobile versions of about 25 other channels - including mtv , sky one and nickelodeon .
testing that service on the bus , a few teething problems and error messages prevent me watching impossible bridges - denmark to sweden on national geographic and , more disappointingly , lost sneak peek on channel 4 .
coronation street fans can catch up with the action on some networks i do manage to connect to the paramount comedy channel - the picture quality is similar to the virgin mobile service , but unfortunately the show is not very funny .
like any tv service , reception is key .
the vodafone system uses the 3g phone network , which covers 72 % of the uk , while virgin mobile use the dab digital radio frequency , which has 85 % coverage .
back on the bus the next day , the vodafone service behaves and it is possible to watch keith chegwin hurtling around a cul-de-sac on gmtv .
viewed on a mobile handset , it looks suspiciously like he is about to carry out a happy slap attack , but luckily he hands over a £ 10,000 cheque instead .
orange , three , o2 and t-mobile have also launched mobile video services , with most operators now offering a choice of channels and downloadable video clips .
on orange , clips of comedy shows like little britain and the office can be downloaded for 50-75p for less than two minutes .
a coronation street catch-up , meanwhile , costs 25p for a one-minute round-up of last night 's action .
' snackable ' shows escaping into a bit of comedy or catching up on last night 's tv on the way home is an attractive option .
but regularly whiling away my bus journeys this way could become an expensive habit .

by ian youngs entertainment reporter , bbc news a new mobile phone tv service lets viewers watch bbc one and itv1 live on the move .
mobile tv is coming of age - but how well does it work ?
and will it catch on ?
virgin mobile 's lobster phone is the first to carry bbc one and itv1 it is approaching two o 'clock and on neighbours , paul is recovering from a shocking murder attempt and karl and susan are embroiled in a passionate affair .
i am on the bus with the new virgin mobile lobster phone - the first to receive the main uk tv channels - in my lap .
the screen is only about 4cm -lrb- 1.5in -rrb- wide , the picture is a little grainy and jerky and the sound is occasionally out of sync .
it is harder work to watch than a normal tv .
but if there is something worth watching , it is definitely watchable .
the virgin mobile service , powered by bt movio , carries bbc one , itv1 , e4 and a slimmed-down version of channel 4 .
it is free on contracts over £ 25 a month - otherwise , users must pay for the phone and a monthly subscription .
it is the latest in a string of mobile tv launches , with a monthly fee the norm .
on vodafone , the likes of sky news and at the races are live , alongside mobile versions of about 25 other channels - including mtv , sky one and nickelodeon .
testing that service on the bus , a few teething problems and error messages prevent me watching impossible bridges - denmark to sweden on national geographic and , more disappointingly , lost sneak peek on channel 4 .
coronation street fans can catch up with the action on some networks i do manage to connect to the paramount comedy channel - the picture quality is similar to the virgin mobile service , but unfortunately the show is not very funny .
like any tv service , reception is key .
the vodafone system uses the 3g phone network , which covers 72 % of the uk , while virgin mobile use the dab digital radio frequency , which has 85 % coverage .
back on the bus the next day , the vodafone service behaves and it is possible to watch keith chegwin hurtling around a cul-de-sac on gmtv .
viewed on a mobile handset , it looks suspiciously like he is about to carry out a happy slap attack , but luckily he hands over a £ 10,000 cheque instead .
orange , three , o2 and t-mobile have also launched mobile video services , with most operators now offering a choice of channels and downloadable video clips .
on orange , clips of comedy shows like little britain and the office can be downloaded for 50-75p for less than two minutes .
a coronation street catch-up , meanwhile , costs 25p for a one-minute round-up of last night 's action .
' snackable ' shows escaping into a bit of comedy or catching up on last night 's tv on the way home is an attractive option .
but regularly whiling away my bus journeys this way could become an expensive habit .
snacking is a word often used when describing mobile tv viewing habits , and " snackable " shows are considered by many in the industry to be the way ahead .
commuting and lunch breaks have been popular times for people to tune in on their handsets , while some also use them as back-up tv sets at home .
but mobile tv is really expected to draw in the viewers when a big event - such as a major news story or a big brother final - is on .
it 's just a way of untethering your tv experience and complementing what you 've got at home nick white virgin mobile " it is partly when you 're out and about and not at a normal television , then you can dip into stuff like that , " says vodafone 's jonathan bill .
" but equally we also see quite good usage when people probably would have access to a tv - in the evening as well . "
nick white of virgin mobile says customers will use mobiles to watch the end of programmes after they leave the house or catch the start of a show before they get home .
it is an " extension " of the normal tv experience , he says .
" in no way is it a substitute .
it 's just a way of untethering your tv experience and complementing what you 've got at home . "
home-made videos patrick parodi , chairman of the mobile entertainment forum , says mobile video is currently a priority for phone companies and broadcasters - but they must understand how to get the most out of it .
" there 's nothing about a mobile phone that resembles a television set , " he says .
" i think the industry needs to be aware that the mechanics and user behaviour when using a mobile phone are much , much different than sitting in front of the tv . "
mobile tv is constantly developing - but will it really take off ?
that behaviour includes creating video as well as watching it , with services such as see me tv on the three network and o2 's lookatme allowing users to upload their own clips .
" it 's a bit like youtube , except you get paid if people watch it , " explains tim green , executive editor of mobile entertainment magazine .
" so some people are making a few hundred quid a month from this .
but they tend to be girls taking their tops off . "
mobile video still has a long way to go before it really takes off , he says , because the offering is " not great " and parts are " still pretty embryonic " .
as for my bus journeys , i may be tempted to tune in for a big news story , a huge event or a must-see show .
my trusty radio may not be quite as cutting-edge - but for now , it is still less hassle and less costly .

there were fears that berwick museum would be closed under cost-cutting moves by the local council .
berwick borough council say it is expensive to run on its current site , and this would save £ 150,000 a year in the long term .
there will now be a three-month public consultation on its future , a move welcomed by local historians .
' extremely difficult ' the museum tells the story of berwick though the ages , and features a collection of art and pottery given by sir william burrell .
john stephenson , leader of berwick borough council , said : " we are in an extremely difficult budgetary situation and have n't got many options on how we can save money .
" we employed consultants who sought the view of the public and gave them 23 options .
" community safety rated very highly , as did concessionary fares and toilets .
the museum came out lowest of all . "
he added that if it were taken over by a charity it could be eligible for heritage lottery funding .
at a meeting on thursday night , councillors voted for a public consultation .
alison cowe , from berwick 's civic society , said : " we are delighted that the council voted to consider the future of the museum rather than its closure .
" we will be taking a very full part , and urging our members to take a part , in the consultation . "

mato oput is the ritual climax of an acholi justice process for bringing reconciliation in the wake of a homicide within the community .
this ceremony was placed on the agenda of peace talks held in the southern sudanese capital , juba , reflecting the earnest search for alternatives to address the grave crimes which have characterised two decades of war in northern uganda .
apart from the killings , abductions , rapes and sexual enslavement of children , the war has inflicted a humanitarian disaster on the region , with more than a million huddled into the squalor and degradation of camps .
having seen the lra escape to neighbouring dr congo and un troops abort a mission to arrest suspects - including lra leader joseph kony - uganda 's president yoweri museveni has said the lra should instead acknowledge their crimes to victims and subject themselves to traditional justice within uganda .
uganda 's amnesty act , introduced six years ago , provides a legal framework for this .
it recognises traditional justice mechanisms like mato oput , and promotes community reconciliation .
reparation to victims under the act , rebels must genuinely abandon and renounce their crimes .
over 17,000 have already done so and are being reintegrated into their communities .
like many african communities , the acholi believe that deep social rifts are caused by killings and require elaborate reconciliation mechanisms to restore fractured relations .
the lra has begun returning to neutral camps under the truce mato oput is performed after a mediated process has brought together two families and clans .
the offender accepts responsibility , asks for forgiveness and must make reparation to the victims .
the perpetrator and the victim 's family then share the root drink from a calabash , to recall and bury the bitterness of the soured relations .
another acholi ritual , gomo tong - the bending of spears - symbolises the ending of hostilities between groups and is also preceded by discussion and truth-telling .
other cleansing rituals are already used to welcome former lra combatants into the communities .
this option , however , is threatened by the war crimes indictments issued by international criminal court for four senior lra commanders .
after the disempowerment and indignity inflicted by war , ugandans are now seeking an active role in resolving this conflict which has torn apart the fabric of their lives and reduced them to observers of their own fate .
in opting for participatory local justice within their communities they are re-asserting lost dignity .
none of these are perfect processes , and neither are they beyond improvement .
everywhere tradition is adapted to answer more complex modern needs ; this affirms africa 's confidence in her ingenuity and rich heritage .
formal justice but there are increasing signs that africans are confidently re-visiting their past .
in uganda , human rights violations have been credibly attributed to the army and auxiliaries operating in the war zones as well as to the rebels .
however , thorough investigations and timely , fair prosecutions have been all too rare .
beyond individual violations , the ugandan government 's policies also bear direct political responsibility for the long failure to end the war .
while mato oput can address individual offences of non-state actors , it is not a suitable vehicle for probing the state 's failures and violations .
ugandans want to see these national issues addressed publicly within the country , not only in juba .
for too long conflicts have held back african hopes .
victims have been helpless to stop abusive armies and warlords .
ending war is an absolute priority for today 's victims and for future generations .
yet insisting on formal justice could easily thwart peace efforts .
uganda should demonstrate that ideological and procedural tensions between international criminal justice and the continent 's aspirations for local solutions to its problems can be resolved without condoning impunity .

mato oput is the ritual climax of an acholi justice process for bringing reconciliation in the wake of a homicide within the community .
this ceremony was placed on the agenda of peace talks held in the southern sudanese capital , juba , reflecting the earnest search for alternatives to address the grave crimes which have characterised two decades of war in northern uganda .
apart from the killings , abductions , rapes and sexual enslavement of children , the war has inflicted a humanitarian disaster on the region , with more than a million huddled into the squalor and degradation of camps .
having seen the lra escape to neighbouring dr congo and un troops abort a mission to arrest suspects - including lra leader joseph kony - uganda 's president yoweri museveni has said the lra should instead acknowledge their crimes to victims and subject themselves to traditional justice within uganda .
uganda 's amnesty act , introduced six years ago , provides a legal framework for this .
it recognises traditional justice mechanisms like mato oput , and promotes community reconciliation .
reparation to victims under the act , rebels must genuinely abandon and renounce their crimes .
over 17,000 have already done so and are being reintegrated into their communities .
like many african communities , the acholi believe that deep social rifts are caused by killings and require elaborate reconciliation mechanisms to restore fractured relations .
the lra has begun returning to neutral camps under the truce mato oput is performed after a mediated process has brought together two families and clans .
the offender accepts responsibility , asks for forgiveness and must make reparation to the victims .
the perpetrator and the victim 's family then share the root drink from a calabash , to recall and bury the bitterness of the soured relations .
another acholi ritual , gomo tong - the bending of spears - symbolises the ending of hostilities between groups and is also preceded by discussion and truth-telling .

the soyuz capsule also carried fellow us astronaut jeff williams and russian cosmonaut pavel vinogradov .
it landed in the 56-mile -lrb- 90km -rrb- predicted zone .
the craft slowed its descent by firing rockets and opening parachutes until it landed softly on its side in a field .
a dozen helicopter rescue teams rushed over to help the astronauts out .
ms ansari was given a bunch of red roses by an official as well as a kiss from her husband , hamid .
all three astronauts were carried on reclining chairs to waiting helicopters .
from kustanai , kazakhstan , they were to fly to a training centre outside moscow .
' safe and sound ' the 40-year-old iranian-born us businesswoman smiled weakly as she exited the russian capsule . "
it was the ride of a lifetime " jeffery williams " they brought me home safe and sound , " she said .
" anousheh has done a good job - she 's one of the team , " itar-tass news agency quoted her co-traveller mr vinogradov as saying .
meanwhile , mr williams told reuters news agency that " it was the ride of a lifetime " .
the return to earth took just over three hours .
g-forces caused by heavy deceleration can be physically draining after time spent " weightless " .
however , the first female muslim space tourist insisted that " this 10 days has been magnificent for me " .
she is thought to have paid at least $ 20m -lrb- £ 10.6m -rrb- for a holiday in space which she said she " hoped to do again soon " .
snails , worms and barley ms ansari becomes the fourth tourist to visit the iss after dennis tito , mark shuttleworth and greg olsen .
her soyuz craft was launched to the iss from baikonur , kazakhstan , on monday 18 september .
ahead of her lift-off , ms ansari said she was an ambassador for attracting private investment into space programmes .
her family sponsored the x-prize , which honoured the first private vehicle to make it into space .
the space explorers brought back snails , worms and barley grown during experiments aboard the iss .

the firm will sell songs from a planned online music store for 99 cents each and will also offer a $ 14.99 a month subscription service .
" it 's not going to be price that really drives people to zune , " said jupiter analyst michael gartenberg .
microsoft hopes the player 's features such as the ability to share music over wi-fi will be its unique selling point .
the wireless technology lets zune owners share music for a limited number of days - three times over three days - and then they can decide whether or not to buy the music .
mr gartenberg said jupiter research had shown that only about 11 % of consumers are interested in sharing music device-to-device .
zune owners will not be able to buy and download music directly on to the player - they will need to download tracks to a pc and transfer to the device .
zune hopes to steal market share from apple 's ipod scott erickson , senior director of zune product management , said : " in total we wo n't be making a profit this year , but we will , of course , work toward becoming a profitable business in the future . "
many analysts believe microsoft is prepared to make a loss to drive the business , much as it did with the xbox console .
microsoft is hoping features such as a built-in fm radio and a music subscription service - offering two million songs to the listener for a monthly fee - will differentiate the device from the ipod .
like the ipod , the zune will also be able to play video and will come pre-installed with some music videos .
the zune has a 30gb hard drive , enough to hold about 5,000 songs , depending on their file size and quality .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- microsoft announces zune pricing bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 29 september 2006 , 08:16 gmt 09:16 uk microsoft announces zune pricing microsoft 's zune , a rival to apple 's ipod , will cost $ 249.99 -lrb- £ 134 -rrb- when it goes on sale on 14 november in the us .
the firm will sell songs from a planned online music store for 99 cents each and will also offer a $ 14.99 a month subscription service .
" it 's not going to be price that really drives people to zune , " said jupiter analyst michael gartenberg .
microsoft hopes the player 's features such as the ability to share music over wi-fi will be its unique selling point .
the wireless technology lets zune owners share music for a limited number of days - three times over three days - and then they can decide whether or not to buy the music .
mr gartenberg said jupiter research had shown that only about 11 % of consumers are interested in sharing music device-to-device .
zune owners will not be able to buy and download music directly on to the player - they will need to download tracks to a pc and transfer to the device .
scott erickson , senior director of zune product management , said : " in total we wo n't be making a profit this year , but we will , of course , work toward becoming a profitable business in the future . "
many analysts believe microsoft is prepared to make a loss to drive the business , much as it did with the xbox console .
microsoft is hoping features such as a built-in fm radio and a music subscription service - offering two million songs to the listener for a monthly fee - will differentiate the device from the ipod .
like the ipod , the zune will also be able to play video and will come pre-installed with some music videos .
the zune has a 30gb hard drive , enough to hold about 5,000 songs , depending on their file size and quality .
apple currently has about half of the global market for mp3 player sales .
microsoft has not announced a release date or pricing for the zune outside of the us .

full story john prescott apologises for letting labour down over the past year and announces it will be his last conference as deputy leader .
full story extremist muslim " bullies " must be faced down , john reid tells the labour conference in a speech which heightened speculation of a leadership bid .
full story gordon brown makes his pitch to the labour party conference in manchester to be britain 's next prime minister .
full story cherie blair denies accusing gordon brown of lying during his keynote labour conference speech .
full story gordon brown " never fully reconciled " himself to tony blair becoming labour leader instead of him in 1994 , peter mandelson tells bbc news .
full story deputy leadership contenders peter hain and harriet harman clash at a fringe meeting , with mr hain dubbing his rivals foreign policy ideas " amateurish " .
full story tony blair is likely to stay as prime minister longer than some had expected , education secretary alan johnson says .
full story former american president bill clinton warns that labour 's biggest problem is that people take its achievements for granted .
full story newly declared deputy leadership challenger jon cruddas tells an evening fringe meeting he can not look his constituents in the face and tell them things have got better under labour .
full story poverty campaigner bob geldof urges gordon brown to stump up £ 400m in new money to help developing countries .
full story return to the top leadership watch all the latest news on the race to be labour 's next leader and deputy leader .
home secretary john reid 's big set-piece speech includes a long section on " leadership " - widely interpreted as a bid to succeed tony blair .
john prescott , who said this would be his last conference as deputy leader , has reportedly gives his backing to gordon brown as the next leader .
labour backbencher jon cruddas has confirmed that he will stand for the deputy leadership of the labour party if and when there is a vacancy .
he had been known to have been considering such a move .
environment secretary david miliband appeared to rule out a leadership bid , saying he was " not a runner or a rider " and that gordon brown was an excellent prime minister in waiting .
alan johnson told bbc breakfast he was not going to talk about the leadership this week - just concentrate on the issues .
work and pensions secretary john hutton has refused to rule out challenging for the leadership , telling the today programme " i 'm not answering that question yet " .
another potential leadership challenger , alan milburn , also refused to rule out a bid , telling a fringe meeting he wanted to talk about issues rather than personalities .
he said too many people had thrown their hats into the ring for the deputy leadership .
jack straw says he has not made his mind up about whether to launch a deputy leadership bid .
two people who have declared an interest in the deputy 's job , harriet harman and peter hain both pledged their undying loyalty to gordon brown at the same meeting and ruled out a bid for the top job .
return to the top conference diary things they wish they 'd never said .
stephen pound was telling a fringe meeting how he had never been able to persuade any of his three wives to join the labour party .
" mind you , two of them are dead so at least we can get their postal votes , " he quipped to nervous laughter - which turned into a roar when panel chairman martin salter pointed out our microphone .
" ironically , " added mr pound .
joke of the week came from conference organiser jeremy beecham pointing to the difference in size between the succession of recent labour chairmen : the bulky charles clarke , john reid , diminutive ian mccartney and pint-sized hazel blears .
" it 's like russian dolls , " says beecham .
prize for the most poorly-attended fringe meeting must go to the work foundation , who invited the editor of the idler magazine , tom hodgkinson , to speak about his campaign to bring back the three-day-week .
mr hodgkinson spoke for half an hour to an audience of six .
it seems nobody else could be bothered to turn up ...
what a triumph of conference timing .
the fringe meeting debating " labour and the lib dems : do two tribes have to go to war ? " was scheduled at the same time as the meeting looking at how to oppose lib dem councils .
and labour criticised the lib dems for saying different things to different people .
david miliband is seen as one of the movers and shakers of the cabinet - and boy , was he moving at one fringe meeting .
when a moby track struck up in the next door tent , miliband could not contain him and started dancing in his seat .
he stopped and looked rather sheepish when we noticed his moves .
return to the top best of the blogs who was the better speaker tony or bill ?
that was the question troubling labour bloggers as the conference drew to a close .
no contest reckons official labour blogger jonathan roberts " his -lsb- clinton 's -rsb- speech was ok , he explains his ideas in a very thoughtful and intelligent way , but has nothing like the oratory skills we saw yesterday of tb " .
mr roberts finally got to shake the hand of his political hero , mr blair , on wednesday evening .
" i was expecting a slightly firmer pressure , and in this embarrassing mix-up of hand-shaking etiquette , i might have accidentally crunched a knuckle or two , " he writes .
elsewhere the debate was all about the leadership and deputy leadership .
was jon cruddas - the former downing street aide who chose conference week to launch a campaign for the not-yet-vacant deputy 's job - just flying a kite ?
" he is a really nice guy but ... has not got a chance of winning and he knows it , " writes mike ion on labour home .
" however his presence will make the internal debate focus more heavily -lrb- and rightly in my view -rrb- on party processes and policy making . "
mwelli had a different view .
" i do n't agree with mike ion that he 's flying a kite without a proper chance to win - as a fresh face , solidly respected by the unions and a strong community campaigner , he 's got to be an attractive choice . "
return to the top photo of the week the blairs savour their moment in the spotlight return to the top quotes of week " it has been a privilege for me to work with and for the most successful ever labour leader and labour prime minister , " gordon brown .
" well , that 's a lie , " cherie blair 's reported comment after watching mr brown 's account of his relationship with her husband .
" at least i do n't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door , " tony blair on his wife 's alleged faux pas .
" the chancellor might have all sorts of flaws but his inner strength as a politician came through , " peter mandelson on mr brown 's big speech .
" i know in the last year i let myself down , i let you down .
so conference , i just want to say sorry , " john prescott bows out .
