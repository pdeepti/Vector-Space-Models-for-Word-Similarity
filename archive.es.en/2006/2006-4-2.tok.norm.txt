program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.04.2006 eu walkout highlights battle of languages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is not a champion of english as europe 's lingua franca when president jacques chirac stormed out of an eu summit last week , furious that a fellow frenchman had spoken english , he may as well have been railing at the tide coming , eu newcomer states say . whether france likes it or not , the dominance of the english language has grown and continues to grow in the european union , bolstered notably by the arrival of 10 mostly ex-communist countries to the bloc in 2004 . when a latvian needs to speak to a lithuanian , when a pole wants to strike up a conversation with an estonian , the tongue they will most likely choose is that of shakespeare , not of moliere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british eu presidency may be over , but its linguistic dominance continues " french is very useful and sometimes necessary in brussels , " said zbigniew gniatkowski , a spokesman for the polish embassy to the european union .
" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .
in the wake of the chirac incident , the paper wrote friday : " french no longer has a monopoly in europe .
perhaps it 's time to wake the president up ? " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish check out dw-world.de 's dossier about the growing importance of english in europe .

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .
in the wake of the chirac incident , the paper wrote friday : " french no longer has a monopoly in europe .
perhaps it 's time to wake the president up ? " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish check out dw-world.de 's dossier about the growing importance of english in europe .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

authorities in the czech republic and germany have called for the evacuation of dozens of cities in the hopes of avoiding a catastrophe . days after issuing the first flood warnings , the high water mark on the elbe and morava rivers continues to climb .
melting snow and heavy rains have forced the gushing currents over their reinforced embankments in several places in the czech republic and germany .
authorities have called for evacuations in several cities in the region as weather forecasters predict a worsening of the situation through the early part of the week . officials in the north and southeast portions of the czech republic forced thousands of people to flee their homes on sunday .
in the town of olomouc , some 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- southeast of prague , a total of 2,500 people await evacuation after an anti-flood barrier along the morava river burst open and gushed through the town in the early morning .
in the north of the country , authorities ordered people to leave the town of hrensko on the german border , where the elbe and kamenice rivers meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of citizens were evacuated from the southern czech city of vranov nad dyji as of saturday night , emergency situations had been declared in half of the czech republic 's 14 regions .
city authorities in the most at risk areas have begun mobilizing emergency aid and establishing municipal accommodation for those evacuated . german-czech border region at risk in the central czech region , where the elbe flows , the situation is especially critical around the town of melnik , some 30 kilometers north of prague .
the head of the region , petr bendl , told reporters that 2,000 people may be forced to flee the town as of sunday .
a 60-kilometer stretch of the river from melnik to the german border has been targeted as a high risk region .
all the cities , towns and villages along this strip of the elbe are under a state of emergency . in germany , around 300 people were evacuated from their homes in saxony 's main city , dresden as the rising elbe lapped over its banks and threatened to flood portions of the historic center .
several houses in the neighborhood of gohlis are underwater , but some 60 residents refuse to leave their homes . bildunterschrift : volunteer helpers pile up sandbags in downtown dresden on april 1 . emergency aid workers and the local fire departments have been battling the rising waters since friday with pumps and sandbags .
in the dresden suburb of laubegast-zschieren , some 700 people were urged to leave their houses before authorities issued forced evacuations . further down the elbe , the cities of bad schandau , prina , wehlen , rathen , königstein and heidenau are already experiencing massive flooding .
the german army has been called in to assist in reinforcing damns and protecting historic buildings . memories of 2002 for both residents and those assisting in the emergency relief efforts , the flooding brings back memories of the region 's last big flood in august 2002 .
dubbed the century 's worst flood , the high waters of the elbe and its tributaries caused an immeasurable amount of damage and financial loss .
the historic downtowns of dresden and smaller cities such as bad schandau and pirna were the sight of severe destruction as architectural jewels were swamped with water and residents struggled to hold on to personal possessions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown wehlen , 30 kilometers south of dresden , is underwater home owners in the region have spent the last few years repairing their houses and recovering from the 2002 flood .
for many , the fear of a similar loss is quite real .
in bad schandau , a woman told reporters she was worried of suffering another flood .
" i do n't think i can go through that again .
it was too much of an ordeal , " she said . hoping to calm those fears , saxony state premier georg milbradt told people they would not experience a catastrophe as in august 2002 .

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

authorities in the czech republic and germany have called for the evacuation of dozens of cities in the hopes of avoiding a catastrophe . days after issuing the first flood warnings , the high water mark on the elbe and morava rivers continues to climb .
melting snow and heavy rains have forced the gushing currents over their reinforced embankments in several places in the czech republic and germany .

the german army has been called in to assist in reinforcing damns and protecting historic buildings . memories of 2002 for both residents and those assisting in the emergency relief efforts , the flooding brings back memories of the region 's last big flood in august 2002 .
dubbed the century 's worst flood , the high waters of the elbe and its tributaries caused an immeasurable amount of damage and financial loss .
the historic downtowns of dresden and smaller cities such as bad schandau and pirna were the sight of severe destruction as architectural jewels were swamped with water and residents struggled to hold on to personal possessions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown wehlen , 30 kilometers south of dresden , is underwater home owners in the region have spent the last few years repairing their houses and recovering from the 2002 flood .
for many , the fear of a similar loss is quite real .
in bad schandau , a woman told reporters she was worried of suffering another flood .
" i do n't think i can go through that again .
it was too much of an ordeal , " she said . hoping to calm those fears , saxony state premier georg milbradt told people they would not experience a catastrophe as in august 2002 .

" is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .

" is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him .

rolf breuer made his decision following his involvement in a legal battle with former media magnate leo kirch . in a statement published sunday , breuer said he had told the supervisory board he had made his decision to step down as a result of a federal court ruling in january against deutsche bank in a legal battle with kirch media . deutsche bank said breuer wanted to " protect the bank from further discussion about him .

anthony di iorio will then become cfo and hugo bänziger will join the board as chief risk officer , the bank announced . uncomfortable court ruling the federal high court ruled in january that the deutsche bank had contravened its contractual obligations towards one of kirch 's companies , printbeteiligungs gmbh , and was therefore liable to pay damages .

authorities in the czech republic and germany have called for the evacuation of dozens of cities in the hopes of avoiding a catastrophe . days after issuing the first flood warnings , the high water mark on the elbe and morava rivers continues to climb .

" is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .

this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2006 budget squeeze sets off goethe institute soul-search großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in pyongyang , north korea , gives a taste of modern german literature .
budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.04.2006 german strikes drag on , french protests escalate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the french , german strikers tend to be more focused in their protests " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .
in the wake of the chirac incident , the paper wrote friday : " french no longer has a monopoly in europe .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .
in the wake of the chirac incident , the paper wrote friday : " french no longer has a monopoly in europe .
perhaps it 's time to wake the president up ? " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with denglish check out dw-world.de 's dossier about the growing importance of english in europe .

" is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.04.2006 german strikes drag on , french protests escalate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the french , german strikers tend to be more focused in their protests " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .
" i 'm not nervous about patients ' comments when the strikes end . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than a million join french jobs law protests more than a million people joined strikes and protests across france tuesday in the biggest show of force yet against the government 's new youth jobs law , as skirmishes with police broke out in paris .

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.04.2006 budget squeeze sets off goethe institute soul-search großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in pyongyang , north korea , gives a taste of modern german literature .
budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

authorities in the czech republic and germany have called for the evacuation of dozens of cities in the hopes of avoiding a catastrophe . days after issuing the first flood warnings , the high water mark on the elbe and morava rivers continues to climb .

in the town of olomouc , some 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- southeast of prague , a total of 2,500 people await evacuation after an anti-flood barrier along the morava river burst open and gushed through the town in the early morning .
in the north of the country , authorities ordered people to leave the town of hrensko on the german border , where the elbe and kamenice rivers meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of citizens were evacuated from the southern czech city of vranov nad dyji as of saturday night , emergency situations had been declared in half of the czech republic 's 14 regions .
city authorities in the most at risk areas have begun mobilizing emergency aid and establishing municipal accommodation for those evacuated . german-czech border region at risk in the central czech region , where the elbe flows , the situation is especially critical around the town of melnik , some 30 kilometers north of prague .
the head of the region , petr bendl , told reporters that 2,000 people may be forced to flee the town as of sunday .
a 60-kilometer stretch of the river from melnik to the german border has been targeted as a high risk region .
all the cities , towns and villages along this strip of the elbe are under a state of emergency . in germany , around 300 people were evacuated from their homes in saxony 's main city , dresden as the rising elbe lapped over its banks and threatened to flood portions of the historic center .
several houses in the neighborhood of gohlis are underwater , but some 60 residents refuse to leave their homes . bildunterschrift : volunteer helpers pile up sandbags in downtown dresden on april 1 . emergency aid workers and the local fire departments have been battling the rising waters since friday with pumps and sandbags .
in the dresden suburb of laubegast-zschieren , some 700 people were urged to leave their houses before authorities issued forced evacuations . further down the elbe , the cities of bad schandau , prina , wehlen , rathen , königstein and heidenau are already experiencing massive flooding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.04.2006 german strikes drag on , french protests escalate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the french , german strikers tend to be more focused in their protests " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .
" i 'm not nervous about patients ' comments when the strikes end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.04.2006 german strikes drag on , french protests escalate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the french , german strikers tend to be more focused in their protests " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .

authorities in the czech republic and germany have called for the evacuation of dozens of cities in the hopes of avoiding a catastrophe . days after issuing the first flood warnings , the high water mark on the elbe and morava rivers continues to climb .
melting snow and heavy rains have forced the gushing currents over their reinforced embankments in several places in the czech republic and germany .
authorities have called for evacuations in several cities in the region as weather forecasters predict a worsening of the situation through the early part of the week . officials in the north and southeast portions of the czech republic forced thousands of people to flee their homes on sunday .
in the town of olomouc , some 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- southeast of prague , a total of 2,500 people await evacuation after an anti-flood barrier along the morava river burst open and gushed through the town in the early morning .

a 60-kilometer stretch of the river from melnik to the german border has been targeted as a high risk region .
all the cities , towns and villages along this strip of the elbe are under a state of emergency . in germany , around 300 people were evacuated from their homes in saxony 's main city , dresden as the rising elbe lapped over its banks and threatened to flood portions of the historic center .

the german army has been called in to assist in reinforcing damns and protecting historic buildings . memories of 2002 for both residents and those assisting in the emergency relief efforts , the flooding brings back memories of the region 's last big flood in august 2002 .
dubbed the century 's worst flood , the high waters of the elbe and its tributaries caused an immeasurable amount of damage and financial loss .
the historic downtowns of dresden and smaller cities such as bad schandau and pirna were the sight of severe destruction as architectural jewels were swamped with water and residents struggled to hold on to personal possessions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown wehlen , 30 kilometers south of dresden , is underwater home owners in the region have spent the last few years repairing their houses and recovering from the 2002 flood .
for many , the fear of a similar loss is quite real .
in bad schandau , a woman told reporters she was worried of suffering another flood .
" i do n't think i can go through that again .
it was too much of an ordeal , " she said . hoping to calm those fears , saxony state premier georg milbradt told people they would not experience a catastrophe as in august 2002 .
" the damages are not comparable , and we are better prepared , " he said .

" is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him .

" is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .

authorities in the czech republic and germany have called for the evacuation of dozens of cities in the hopes of avoiding a catastrophe . days after issuing the first flood warnings , the high water mark on the elbe and morava rivers continues to climb .
melting snow and heavy rains have forced the gushing currents over their reinforced embankments in several places in the czech republic and germany .
authorities have called for evacuations in several cities in the region as weather forecasters predict a worsening of the situation through the early part of the week . officials in the north and southeast portions of the czech republic forced thousands of people to flee their homes on sunday .
in the town of olomouc , some 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- southeast of prague , a total of 2,500 people await evacuation after an anti-flood barrier along the morava river burst open and gushed through the town in the early morning .

the head of the region , petr bendl , told reporters that 2,000 people may be forced to flee the town as of sunday .
a 60-kilometer stretch of the river from melnik to the german border has been targeted as a high risk region .
all the cities , towns and villages along this strip of the elbe are under a state of emergency . in germany , around 300 people were evacuated from their homes in saxony 's main city , dresden as the rising elbe lapped over its banks and threatened to flood portions of the historic center .

the german army has been called in to assist in reinforcing damns and protecting historic buildings . memories of 2002 for both residents and those assisting in the emergency relief efforts , the flooding brings back memories of the region 's last big flood in august 2002 .
dubbed the century 's worst flood , the high waters of the elbe and its tributaries caused an immeasurable amount of damage and financial loss .
the historic downtowns of dresden and smaller cities such as bad schandau and pirna were the sight of severe destruction as architectural jewels were swamped with water and residents struggled to hold on to personal possessions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown wehlen , 30 kilometers south of dresden , is underwater home owners in the region have spent the last few years repairing their houses and recovering from the 2002 flood .
for many , the fear of a similar loss is quite real .
in bad schandau , a woman told reporters she was worried of suffering another flood .
" i do n't think i can go through that again .
it was too much of an ordeal , " she said . hoping to calm those fears , saxony state premier georg milbradt told people they would not experience a catastrophe as in august 2002 .
" the damages are not comparable , and we are better prepared , " he said .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save . " given the changes in the geopolitical landscape , and the fact that there is less money available , we have to look for ways to secure our future , " said a spokeswoman for the goethe institute in berlin . budget victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goethe institute in ramallah " we are not actively debating closure scenarios " for individual goethe institutes , she said .
but she acknowledged they could also not be ruled out . " our talks are going in all directions , " the spokeswoman said .
this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .
the foreign ministry and the goethe institute headquarters are discussing the 2006 budget , which may be tighter yet . geopolitical changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors look at posters celebrating 50 years of goethe institute .
the federal budget tightening merely helped expedite a clearly necessary soul-searching process , the institute told dpa . after all , the goethe institute , which was founded in 1951 , developed its sites in a different geopolitical era ; currently 43 percent of the goethe institute resources go to western europe . but times have changed , and the organization may soon be asking itself if it still makes sense to fund seven sites in italy when it only maintains two in mainland china . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german goethe institute in togo attacked german foreign ministry officials said friday they had summoned togo 's ambassador in berlin to demand an investigation into an attack on the german cultural center in the western african country , where violence has erupted following disputed weekend elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on religion german muslim group elects islam convert for top post intelligent design debate arrives in germany germany 's jewish community begins search for new president " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " germany -pipe- 02.04.2006 bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was received enthusiastically in germany in august the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say . the popularity of benedict xvi 's predecessor john paul ii in germany had waned towards the end of his pontificate .
he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .

" but english is essential .
there are many groups that work only in english . " back home in poland , " everyone wants to learn english , " especially because of its association with music , us culture and the internet , added 33-year-old gniatkowski , who arrived in brussels shortly after his country entered the eu . chirac shocked by use of e n glish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac would like to hear more french in europe that sentiment is not shared by chirac , who - to the astonishment of officials and to the amusement of the british press - abruptly walked out of an eu session thursday , accusing the french head of europe 's employer union of piquing french pride by daring to speak english . chirac said he had been " deeply shocked " to hear english on the lips of the frenchman in a speech at the two-day summit . while chirac 's tantrum at the summit caused surprise , some interpret it as a sign of wider french frustration over loss of influence in the eu . eu e n largeme n t dilutes fre n ch clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her language seems more appealing than his the arrival of 10 newcomers in the union just under two years ago is widely seen as having diluted paris ' clout and speeded up a shift in the bloc 's center of balance which had already been underway or some years . even before they joined the eu their ties with chirac were strained when the french leader told them they had " missed a good opportunity to shut up " over supporting the 2003 iraq war . and the more free-market inclinations of some of the newcomers have proved more in tune with the economic liberalism championed by britain , rather than with the stance of the french . paris , london 's traditional rival for power , has recently faced mounting accusations of economic protectionism . fre n ch disappeari n g from brussels ?
franco-british rivalry extends to the linguistic level in brussels , where french speakers regularly complain that official documents increasingly appear in english and only later in french - even though english , french and german are the working languages of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu meetings are increasingly held in english " previously there was more french used in official communication in brussels , " said peteris ustubs , a foreign affairs adviser to latvian prime minister aigars kalvitis .
" now all the time i have the feeling that this is diminishing . " illustrating the trend , statistics show that in 1997 , 40 percent of european commission documents were first drawn up in french before being translated , and 45 percent were originally drafted in english .
by 2004 , just 26 percent of documents were in french in their first form , and 62 percent in english . chirac 's allies but the french language does have its defenders among the new eu member states - including poland 's french-born foreign minister stefan meller , a former ambassador to paris . " in terms of the new members of the eu , it is a flawed stereotype that they only speak english , " meller said .
" i know at least several colleagues who very often speak in french . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the fall of french in europe make french people even more anti-eu ?
latvian aide ustubs , 36 , speaks french and insisted that officials from the new eu member states can hold their own in the language of moliere . but " probably in the new member states , french is the second foreign language , " he said .
" english is likely to be the first foreign language . " for the french-language belgian daily le soir , the lesson is clear .

budget cuts are forcing germany 's main cultural-outreach organization , the goethe institute , to examine its future - and review its options . the goethe institute is one of germany 's key instruments for promoting itself to the outside world .
at its network of some 180 sites around the globe , the organization provides information on german culture , society and politics , as well as language instruction .
but belt-tightening at the federal level has been eating into the institute 's budget , with cutbacks of around 2.5 percent per year over the past several years .
as a result , the group says , it is discussing various ways to keep meeting its mandate .
this means searching for new funds as well as looking for new places to save .

this included searching for new funds - for example through beefed up partnerships with organizations and companies . a goethe institute spokesperson told the dpa news agency it would present a fixed master plan for the organization 's future in may or june . reductions in federal spending mean the institute 's budget for 2005 is down to 109 million euros per year , including personnel costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.04.2006 german strikes drag on , french protests escalate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike the french , german strikers tend to be more focused in their protests " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say . thomas muders , an anesthesiologist at the bonn university clinic , has been on strike for two weeks , but taking to the street was n't a decision he made lightly . " it is true that things have to be pretty bad for doctors to strike , " muders said .
" i would rather be treating my patients - that 's why i became a doctor - but things ca n't continue the way they are going now . " that feeling is echoed by the doctors , civil servants and , most recently , metal workers who have gone on strike in germany over the last two months , as well as students and union members across the border in france . though both the german and french strikes are directed against planned cuts in the social and labor market , the german protests have n't reached the size or resulted in the outcry heard on the streets of paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general strikes in france shut down many public services french students first took to the streets three weeks ago to protest a proposed law that would make hiring and firing young employees easier .
the demonstrations reached violent proportions that led to hundreds of arrests and left the country in a state of political upheaval last week with additional nationwide protests planned for april 4 . germans try bargaining first the political influence of trade unions and other employee associations in germany is part of what keeps german strikes from reaching violent proportions , according to henrik uterwedde of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg . " it is second nature for german politicians to seek the unions ' opinions while they are designing policy , " he said .
" that is unheard of in france , where the state believes it always knows better . " experience has taught french workers that more can be achieved by getting politicians ' attention on the street than trying to make a deal .
german unions , which are consulted before new policies are made , use strikes as a final bargaining chip when they ca n't otherwise reach a compromise , uterwedde added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans unions are able to acheive more in negotations than on the street " german strikes take place when negotiations have reached a dead end , " he said .
" in france , they are used to force negotiations . " uterwedde stressed that france 's proclivity for striking is the result of protests ' past successes and the lack of political sway german associations enjoy , not a hereditary love of thronging into the streets to relive their revolution . unions stick to their own issues an adversity to multi-union strikes is another reason german protests ca n't match the size of those seen in paris .
the broad social protests common to france are nearly unheard of in germany , according to peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's freie university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions remaind wary of germany 's 2004 hartz iv protests " the trade unions stick to pay-scale confrontations and trying to prevent plant closings , while other social protests , such as the 2004 hartz iv labor market protests , are organized independently of the unions , " he said .
" there has not been a serious attempt to bring the two together . " the german doctors , civil servants and metal workers who are currently striking in germany also have separate , branch-specific contracts and negotiators prefer to concentrate on their particular situation , uterwedde said . " german unions would n't say , ' great , we 've got three irons in the oven , let 's put them together to raise the pressure ' because the logic of a german strike connects it to a specific dispute , " he said . concern also exists among the negotiators that cooperating with other groups could complicate their own situation when they have to go back to the bargaining table .
instead of joining forces , groups avoid becoming involved in too many disputes and focus on bending politicians ' ears to their own affairs , grottian said . french more willing to accept protests a wider public acceptance of people taking to the streets also makes work disturbances more common in france than germany . " strikes are seen as a more ' normal ' part of social life in france , " uterwedde said .
" since strikes are more seldom in germany , the tolerance threshold for them is lower . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors want the public to know why they are striking people become especially impatient when disruptions occur in the public sector , he said .
not being able to get to work or bring their children to daycare makes germans less tolerant of strikes than when they are directed at far-away government policies and officials . muders , the bonn clinic anesthesiologist , said he feels making sure people hear why he 's striking is essential to keeping popular opinion behind him . " people are understanding when they hear what the situation is like , " he said .

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

he won enthusiastic support here for his defense of human rights but sparked anger with his public admonishment of the church 's involvement in abortion advice clinics in the country . the election of bavarian-born joseph ratzinger a year ago appears to have come at the right time for the roman catholic church in germany , which , though it boasts 26 million members , was seeing church attendance decline at an alarming rate . benedict xvi 's visit to cologne last august for the world youth day festival proved that the shyness for which the former cardinal ratzinger was well-known would not hamper his reception by the public .
he received an enthusiastic welcome on his first visit to his homeland since his election .
the tone was set when thousands of teenagers waded into the waters of the rhine to get a closer look as the pontiff passed on a ferry , and one million young people , the majority of them germans , took part in the closing mass . the organizers of the pope 's upcoming visit to bavaria in august are confident of a similar reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope bendikt xvi met with famous church dissident hans küng in september even beyond catholic circles , the pope has been good for the church locally .
while 59 percent of catholics believe his election has boosted the catholic church in germany , 54 percent of agnostics and 52 percent of protestants share the same view , according to a recent survey for the neue bildpost .
a quarter of germans believe it is important that the pope is one of them , and 37 percent view him as moderately reform-minded , while 45 percent believe he is highly conservative .
germans traditionally suspicious of popes it has played in benedict 's favor that he is a german theologian who has mastered the subtleties of contemporary thinking on religion in a country where a traditional suspicion of popes remains high .
but while he has drawn praise for setting a new tone , critics such as the anti-establishment group " we are church " say he has taken an " ambivalent " stance on issues that matter to germans . " he has engaged in thinking about the role of women in the church but does not want them to be ordained .
and he has held audiences with the anti-authority theologian hans küng but has seen traditionalists in far greater numbers , " said " we are church " spokesman christian weisner .
" benedict xvi promotes ecumenism with the orthodox church but not with protestants , and talks fulsomely about love in an encyclical yet forbids homosexuals from becoming priests . " renowned theologian and psychoanalyst eugen drewermann lost patience with the pope and left the catholic church in december .
still , churches closing while some observers saw the world youth day festival as having little lasting impact , the head of the catholic church in germany , cardinal karl lehmann , sees a direct link with rising church attendance .
he told der spiegel magazine that the number of members leaving the church had reduced by a third in 2005 compared with the previous year , and there were " three times as many new worshippers , most of whom were returning to the church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even non-catholics believe the pope has boosted the church in germany the south of the country , especially the states of bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate remain strongly catholic . but the effect of a german pope has done little to reverse predictions from the german bishops ' conference that 700 catholic churches will cease to be used as places of worship over the next decade . religious affiliation is relatively simple to measure in germany because believers must register to pay church tax . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

researchers in the uk are uncovering the ways fingerprints are changed by age , smoking , drug use and even some personal grooming products .
the work also promises to help obtain good quality copies of prints that have gone unnoticed for days or weeks .
related work aims to find prints on guns and bomb fragments that are often among the most difficult to recover .
led by dr sue jickells from kings college , london , the work on getting more from fingerprints started by looking at the chemical components of prints and how they change over time .
dr jickells said much of the material left behind when people touch anything are fat molecules , or lipids .
" there are a lot of lipids in fingerprints , " said dr jickells , " and there are a lot of possibilities for that . "
old evidence one such lipid , called squalene which is a precursor to cholesterol , is heavily present in fingerprints .
squalene breaks down over a period of days , as do the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids left behind by human touch .
this makes it harder for traditional techniques to reveal prints .
exploiting this knowledge of how these organic compounds break down , dr jickell 's group is now working on ways to get good quality evidence from relatively old prints .
the research has also shown how fingerprints can be used to give clues about the person that left a print .
dr jickells said that adults , children and the elderly lay down different sorts of organic compounds in the prints .
furthermore , drug users typically excrete the metabolised products of the chemical they use .
for instance , smokers are known to secrete cotinine , a chemical produced when the human body breaks down nicotine .
work is now going on with methadone maintenance clinics and cocaine addiction centres to see how drug use changes the prints users leave behind .
revealing patterns the complementary work by professor neil mcmurray and colleagues at the university of wales , swansea , also aims to get more out of fingerprints left when the most serious of crimes are committed .
professor mcmurray 's work shows how it is possible to recover fingerprints from the metal surfaces of bullets and shrapnel .
prints left on guns and bomb casings tend to be patterns left by human sweat and , as such , are not easy to reveal using established techniques that employ powders and other chemicals .
instead , professor mcmurray measures the tiny electrochemical reactions that result when fingers touch metal .
a device called a scanning kelvin probe is used to measure the tiny changes in electrical potential caused by these reactions .
print patterns have been found even on metal that has been subjected to temperatures of 600c .
the technique has been shown to work with iron , steel , aluminium , zinc and brass and can even cope with the curves found on bullets .
professor mcmurray said the end result of the research would be a portable device that could analyse prints at crime scenes .
the research on fingerprints was presented at an event in london organised by the engineering and physical sciences research council to highlight how science can aid forensic work .

" there are a lot of lipids in fingerprints , " said dr jickells , " and there are a lot of possibilities for that . "

squalene breaks down over a period of days , as do the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids left behind by human touch .
this makes it harder for traditional techniques to reveal prints .

the research has also shown how fingerprints can be used to give clues about the person that left a print .
dr jickells said that adults , children and the elderly lay down different sorts of organic compounds in the prints .
furthermore , drug users typically excrete the metabolised products of the chemical they use .

prints left on guns and bomb casings tend to be patterns left by human sweat and , as such , are not easy to reveal using established techniques that employ powders and other chemicals .
instead , professor mcmurray measures the tiny electrochemical reactions that result when fingers touch metal .
a device called a scanning kelvin probe is used to measure the tiny changes in electrical potential caused by these reactions .

it was used by early immigrants in the first half of the 19th century .
it was called the dissident cemetery since it was used by the protestant and jewish communities who were not allowed to bury their dead in the roman catholic cemeteries used by the majority of the population .
the find has excited experts keen to learn more about their country 's early days .
the dead had lain undisturbed under this plaza in the heart of buenos aires for more than 100 years when builders laying drainage pipes exposed them to the light .
here lay the bones of men , woman and children surrounded by the remains from their simple funerals : pieces of rotten wood from coffins , metal coffin handles , nails and broken bottles .
archaeologists are carrying out a full investigation into what they might find .
leading the search is archaeologist marcelo wiesel , who says a rich history lies under buenos aires . "
this is a hugely important find - cemeteries and rituals surrounding death tell us a great deal about how each community lived " silvia fajre , buenos aires council 's culture department " we hope this will help to tell us how buenos aires transformed itself so fast , " he says .
perhaps the greatest discovery so far is a gravestone found two metres underground , marking the spot where a 10-month old german girl was buried in 1886 .
city restorer , josefina crepy , says it was in almost perfect condition - there were a couple of dents , probably caused by the builders who found it .
removal the work she and her colleagues are doing will provide one piece of an emerging story .
argentina saw huge waves of immigration in the early part of the 19th century , hoping to take advantage of the lush pastures in the interior of the country and the opportunities in buenos aires , which at the time was one of the fastest growing cities in the world .
most came from italy and spain .
but large numbers also arrived from across europe - germans , british , hungarians , french and scandinavians .
most of these north european immigrants were protestant and jewish , and found there was no place for them to bury their dead in the roman catholic cemeteries inside the city .
so they established burial grounds outside city limits which became known as dissident cemeteries .
the second of these was in the area of buenos aires now called once ... still a place which draws immigrants , now mostly from east asia .
it was called the victoria cemetery and soon became crowded .
the only alternative was to throw corpses in the river .
as these non-catholic immigrants established themselves they recognised the need to find a more permanent , fitting place to bury their dead . "
nearly 200 years later the dissident dead are beginning to tell their stories to a new generation of argentines " they found that in a corner of chacarita , one of the biggest cemeteries in buenos aires which today boasts a very well tended german and alongside it , an equally beautiful british burial ground .
a huge operation was put in place to move the remains from the victoria dissidents ' cemetery to their new resting place .
but contact with some families had been lost and others simply did not want to finance the move .
those bodies have rested in peace under what today is a neighbourhood plaza .
the question arises of what to do with them .
yellow fever epidemic the head of the city council 's culture department , silvia fajre , says that according to the evidence they have so far , many hundreds of bodies remained in the dissidents ' cemetery and many months of archaeological work will be necessary before they know exactly what they have got .
" this is a hugely important find , " she says .
" we understand that cemeteries and rituals surrounding death tell us a great deal about how each community lived ... also what they ate , their illnesses , the ceremonies they practised . "
the local residents have , for the time being , lost their green space .
the city authorities say they are keen to include them in the work , talking to schools and probably , when the operation is completed , establishing some kind of memorial to those who died in the early days of the new argentina .
one of those watching with interest is the reverend david george of the anglican cathedral in buenos aires .
that community has just celebrated 175 years in argentina .
rev george holds the births , marriages and death records from those early days in a vault at the cathedral .
they show that those early pioneers came from all walks of life : accountants , coopers , blacksmiths , fishermen , bar-keepers and saddlers .
and they died for a range of reasons : " fell off horse , died in fight , bad liver , found dead for no apparent reason , drowned . "
thousands were killed by the yellow fever epidemic of 1871 .
most never reached the age of 40 and what the records tell us without doubt is that building the new argentina was not easy .
in the rush to build a new nation , a lot of information was lost and little was recorded about how ordinary people struggled , lived , loved and died .
but it was not lost forever , and nearly 200 years later the dissident dead are beginning to tell their stories to a new generation of argentines .

the bodies have rested under what today is a neighbourhood plaza it was called the dissident cemetery since it was used by the protestant and jewish communities who were not allowed to bury their dead in the roman catholic cemeteries used by the majority of the population .
the find has excited experts keen to learn more about their country 's early days .
the dead had lain undisturbed under this plaza in the heart of buenos aires for more than 100 years when builders laying drainage pipes exposed them to the light .
here lay the bones of men , woman and children surrounded by the remains from their simple funerals : pieces of rotten wood from coffins , metal coffin handles , nails and broken bottles .
archaeologists are carrying out a full investigation into what they might find .
leading the search is archaeologist marcelo wiesel , who says a rich history lies under buenos aires .
this is a hugely important find - cemeteries and rituals surrounding death tell us a great deal about how each community lived silvia fajre , buenos aires council 's culture department " we hope this will help to tell us how buenos aires transformed itself so fast , " he says .
perhaps the greatest discovery so far is a gravestone found two metres underground , marking the spot where a 10-month old german girl was buried in 1886 .
city restorer , josefina crepy , says it was in almost perfect condition - there were a couple of dents , probably caused by the builders who found it .
removal the work she and her colleagues are doing will provide one piece of an emerging story .
argentina saw huge waves of immigration in the early part of the 19th century , hoping to take advantage of the lush pastures in the interior of the country and the opportunities in buenos aires , which at the time was one of the fastest growing cities in the world .
most came from italy and spain .
but large numbers also arrived from across europe - germans , british , hungarians , french and scandinavians .
an unearthed gravestone from 1886 written in german most of these north european immigrants were protestant and jewish , and found there was no place for them to bury their dead in the roman catholic cemeteries inside the city .
so they established burial grounds outside city limits which became known as dissident cemeteries .
the second of these was in the area of buenos aires now called once ... still a place which draws immigrants , now mostly from east asia .
it was called the victoria cemetery and soon became crowded .
the only alternative was to throw corpses in the river .
as these non-catholic immigrants established themselves they recognised the need to find a more permanent , fitting place to bury their dead .
nearly 200 years later the dissident dead are beginning to tell their stories to a new generation of argentines they found that in a corner of chacarita , one of the biggest cemeteries in buenos aires which today boasts a very well tended german and alongside it , an equally beautiful british burial ground .
a huge operation was put in place to move the remains from the victoria dissidents ' cemetery to their new resting place .
but contact with some families had been lost and others simply did not want to finance the move .
those bodies have rested in peace under what today is a neighbourhood plaza .
the question arises of what to do with them .
yellow fever epidemic the head of the city council 's culture department , silvia fajre , says that according to the evidence they have so far , many hundreds of bodies remained in the dissidents ' cemetery and many months of archaeological work will be necessary before they know exactly what they have got .
" this is a hugely important find , " she says .
" we understand that cemeteries and rituals surrounding death tell us a great deal about how each community lived ... also what they ate , their illnesses , the ceremonies they practised . "
a lot of information was lost in the rush to build a new nation the local residents have , for the time being , lost their green space .
the city authorities say they are keen to include them in the work , talking to schools and probably , when the operation is completed , establishing some kind of memorial to those who died in the early days of the new argentina .
one of those watching with interest is the reverend david george of the anglican cathedral in buenos aires .
that community has just celebrated 175 years in argentina .
rev george holds the births , marriages and death records from those early days in a vault at the cathedral .
they show that those early pioneers came from all walks of life : accountants , coopers , blacksmiths , fishermen , bar-keepers and saddlers .
and they died for a range of reasons : " fell off horse , died in fight , bad liver , found dead for no apparent reason , drowned . "
thousands were killed by the yellow fever epidemic of 1871 .
most never reached the age of 40 and what the records tell us without doubt is that building the new argentina was not easy .
in the rush to build a new nation , a lot of information was lost and little was recorded about how ordinary people struggled , lived , loved and died .
but it was not lost forever , and nearly 200 years later the dissident dead are beginning to tell their stories to a new generation of argentines .

on the ground below , a couple of people kicked a ball around .
within minutes , two teams formed .
the players could be glaswegian , iraqi , nigerian , albanian - there are over 50 different nationalities in the city 's sighthill estate .
they might not speak the same language , but on this makeshift football pitch , they communicated with their feet .
football has proved a great tool in helping asylum seekers and refugees to integrate .
for prendush lleshi it was a lifeline .
he arrived in glasgow in 2001 , fleeing death threats in albania .
for two years , he struggled with depression , feeling he 'd failed his young family .
his love of football helped him settle in .
he started coaching kids ' teams and now has two youth qualifications .
" people here are passionate about football , " he said .
" if you are a good footballer , to them it means you 're a good person . "
things have not always been so rosy .
' misinformation ' in 2000 , when 5,000 asylum seekers arrived under the home office 's dispersal programme , there was hostility and anger .
the locals had not been prepared for the influx .
community activist margaret thomson said : " on a daily basis , you saw more people arriving .
" you knew they were strangers because they looked out of place .
" you saw the fear in their eyes .
" and there seemed to be thousands of them . "
mohammad asif , an afghani refugee , said : " you do n't really blame the people - they were given the wrong information . "
when violence erupted in 2001 , after a turkish asylum seeker was murdered , both asylum seekers and locals realised something had to be done .
mohammad said : " we explained to the local community that we are not here to steal your jobs , we are here for a genuine reason , being persecuted in our own countries .
" it was the ordinary scottish people coming together and working together that has made the community a better place for everyone . "
changing landscape sighthill may still be deprived but today it 's a lot more welcoming .
there is a political welcome as well .
the issues surrounding asylum in scotland differ from those south of the border .
scotland 's population is falling .
part of glasgow 's motivation for taking part in the dispersal programme was the hope that refugees would boost the city 's declining workforce .
recently , the treatment of asylum seeker families has become a hotly debated topic within the scottish parliament .
scotland has no say in which asylum seekers stay or go - that remains a home office matter .
in spite , or perhaps because of this , the arguments look set to run and run .
as the political debate continues scotland 's refugees keep playing football and living their lives .
now glasgow is their home .
prendush said : " when i came to sighthill , i thought i ca n't really stay forever .
" but i am still there .
things have changed . "
" playing for scotland " will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 on monday 19 june 2006 at 2000 bst .

the mayor of kapchagai is very keen .

almaty now has nearly 40 casinos .
their colourful neon lights make some of the most impressive displays in a city which has been transformed in recent years .
but president nazarbayev has said he wants to move the casinos and the hundreds of smaller gambling businesses out of the city entirely , to the shores of lake kapchagai , a huge reservoir 80km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- away .
almaty unimpressed that is in the vast dry steppe , a landscape not unlike the deserts which surround las vegas , but with a beach as well .
lake kapchagai is already popular in the hot kazakh summers , despite the shabby soviet industrial town nearby .
kazakh officials feel the right amount of gambling goes a long way the president says talks are already under way with big investors to build the first street of a new entertainment city , with casinos , hotels and restaurants .
the mayor of kapchagai is very keen .
he says an asian las vegas here would attract tourists from all over asia , not least from kazakhstan 's giant neighbour , china , home to some of the world 's most avid gamblers .
the owners of almaty 's casinos are much less impressed .
they fear the huge investments they have already made will be lost if they are forced to close down in the city .
and some mutter darkly that the plans to build a las vegas on kapchagai will simply further enrich a few kazakh oligarchs with friends and relatives in the ruling elite .

the london mayor told the bbc that the american embassy 's decision not to pay the road toll was " unacceptable " as it would cost londoners more .
mr livingstone has been reported to a standards watchdog for comments he made about the ambassador for not paying .
the embassy said the charge is a local tax which , under the vienna convention , does not apply to foreign diplomats .
mr livingstone told andrew marr on sunday am : " i have to say i do think it is completely and utterly unacceptable that the american ambassador turns up , having made his billions selling cars , and they stop -lsb- paying -rsb- .
breach of code " particularly at a time when we are the only serious ally that america 's got and our young people are putting their lives on the line for george bush 's foreign policy every day .
" i think it stinks that he 's weaselling his way out of paying his fair share to london because it makes londoners have to pay more because he 's not paying his way . "
campaign group liberty and law said it had reported the london mayor to the standards board for england for breaching its code over comments he made about the us ambassador robert tuttle .
mr livingstone is already appealing against a four week suspension for another comment .
gerald hartup , liberty and law director , said the mayor was in breach of the code 's requirement that members must treat others with respect .
the london assembly conservatives have backed the mayor 's calls for the us staff to pay the charge , but criticised his outburst .
