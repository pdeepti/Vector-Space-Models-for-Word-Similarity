" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .

aimed in particular at helping to underpin germany 's small-to-middle sized business sector , the draft reforms are due to be presented to parliament by the middle of next year . the reform aims to make germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , which are increasingly moving operations to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
the new tax rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

the trip to the zoo , navigating along canals and streams that lead from the swans ' home on the city 's aasee lake , began thursday and is to be completed on nov .

peter was said to have paddled obediently alongside as the object of his affection throughout journey . peter has been stalking the boat - a 2-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- high , white , fiberglass structure shaped like a swan - since the springtime . staff at the zoo believe the winter break may cure peter 's obsession .
and if the weather does n't do it , zoo staff are relying on the other six black swans in the zoo 's collection . " four of them are unmated , so there 's hope for peter yet , " said monika ewering , the swan 's keeper at the zoo . amorous peter may find real love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trouble in paradise ?
peter could be losing interest ewering 's work may not be too hard .
park visitors said they had the impression that peter 's affection for the boat was waning anyway .
in recent weeks , the celebrity swan had spent less and less time trailing it and more and more time accepting food gifts from curious tourists at the lakeside . black swans are native to australia but there is a small wild population in europe , where animal protection groups feed both the black and white types during winter when lakes are frozen over . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a match made in heaven ?

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

" ackermann , 58 , stands accused along with five other top-ranking executives of breach of fiduciary duty for signing off on the bonuses . the case put executive pay in germany in the spotlight and raised ethical questions about the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a huge mobile telecommunications group . would quit if found guilty although the six defendants were initially acquitted in july 2004 , the federal constitutional court ordered a retrial at the end of last year .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .

is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .
all of the 25 eu member states must approve the constitution for it to come into effect . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german delegation to tehran faces dead end in nuclear conflict a group of german parliamentarians is in tehran this week to help defuse the ongoing conflict over iran 's nuclear program .

safeguard clauses will allow the eu to withhold aid funds if either country fails to adhere to treaty obligations .
the eu can also ban the import of goods from both countries if they fail to meet eu standards . officials in brussels say that while safeguard clauses apply to all member states , they are being especially applied in the cases of romania and bulgaria . germany 's presidency may be tough on new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants assurances from the new eu members merkel warned that her government may demand extra measures from romania and bulgaria when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in january to improve justice and home affairs standards prior to the new year admission of both countries . the german chancellor told reporters she had asked european commission president jose manuel barroso to report to berlin in late december on whether both romania and bulgaria have rectified what she termed " deficits in interior and justice policies . " " how the commission reports to us ... will determine whether germany demands any measures or not , " said merkel .
she did not specify what steps berlin might seek from bucharest and sofia . last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , voted in favor of allowing romania and bulgaria to join the eu and merkel said she was confident the bundesrat upper house would do the same later this month .
" romania has made great efforts to join the eu , " she said . romanian leader accepts eu skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tariceanu knows the eu will be watching tariceanu admitted it was necessary to create confidence in the old eu states regarding romania and bulgaria 's implementation of european standards . turning to the question of further eu enlargement including potential accession candidates croatia , turkey and macedonia , tariceanu said it was clear there was reluctance to take in more states after the bloc expands to 27 members with the admission of romania and bulgaria .
" probably europe needs a break now , " he said . but tariceanu stressed that applicant states needed to given a european perspective to keep up incentives for building stronger democratic institutions and free markets . " croatia ... is a country that from my point of view can be prepared to join very soon , " he said .
" it is not the case for the others . " turkey was " the most complicated situation " said the romanian leader who nevertheless hailed ankara 's progress .
" if they feel rejected there will be a huge possibility to see turkey turning to another type of behavior -lrb- given its -rrb- geographical position , " said tariceanu .
" so we have to be very open when considering turkey as a future partner of the european union . " tariceanu already a constitution fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is currently at a dead end when asked on his views on the eu constitution , the romanian leader said he rejected calls by the dutch government to radically slim down and rename the failed document in order to get it approved .
" i do n't think this is the solution , frankly speaking , " he said .

the new tax rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .

so we have the same treatment , " tariceanu said , adding : " do n't consider romania or even bulgaria being a second class member . " under the terms for accession to the eu bloc , regular reports will be filed to brussels on romanian and bulgarian compliance with eu rules .
safeguard clauses will allow the eu to withhold aid funds if either country fails to adhere to treaty obligations .

" " how the commission reports to us ... will determine whether germany demands any measures or not , " said merkel .
she did not specify what steps berlin might seek from bucharest and sofia . last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , voted in favor of allowing romania and bulgaria to join the eu and merkel said she was confident the bundesrat upper house would do the same later this month .

" probably europe needs a break now , " he said . but tariceanu stressed that applicant states needed to given a european perspective to keep up incentives for building stronger democratic institutions and free markets . " croatia ... is a country that from my point of view can be prepared to join very soon , " he said .
" it is not the case for the others . " turkey was " the most complicated situation " said the romanian leader who nevertheless hailed ankara 's progress .
" if they feel rejected there will be a huge possibility to see turkey turning to another type of behavior -lrb- given its -rrb- geographical position , " said tariceanu .

" the safeguard clauses are applied to old members .
so we have the same treatment , " tariceanu said , adding : " do n't consider romania or even bulgaria being a second class member . " under the terms for accession to the eu bloc , regular reports will be filed to brussels on romanian and bulgarian compliance with eu rules .
safeguard clauses will allow the eu to withhold aid funds if either country fails to adhere to treaty obligations .
the eu can also ban the import of goods from both countries if they fail to meet eu standards . officials in brussels say that while safeguard clauses apply to all member states , they are being especially applied in the cases of romania and bulgaria . germany 's presidency may be tough on new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants assurances from the new eu members merkel warned that her government may demand extra measures from romania and bulgaria when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in january to improve justice and home affairs standards prior to the new year admission of both countries . the german chancellor told reporters she had asked european commission president jose manuel barroso to report to berlin in late december on whether both romania and bulgaria have rectified what she termed " deficits in interior and justice policies . " " how the commission reports to us ... will determine whether germany demands any measures or not , " said merkel .
she did not specify what steps berlin might seek from bucharest and sofia . last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , voted in favor of allowing romania and bulgaria to join the eu and merkel said she was confident the bundesrat upper house would do the same later this month .
" romania has made great efforts to join the eu , " she said . romanian leader accepts eu skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tariceanu knows the eu will be watching tariceanu admitted it was necessary to create confidence in the old eu states regarding romania and bulgaria 's implementation of european standards . turning to the question of further eu enlargement including potential accession candidates croatia , turkey and macedonia , tariceanu said it was clear there was reluctance to take in more states after the bloc expands to 27 members with the admission of romania and bulgaria .
" probably europe needs a break now , " he said . but tariceanu stressed that applicant states needed to given a european perspective to keep up incentives for building stronger democratic institutions and free markets . " croatia ... is a country that from my point of view can be prepared to join very soon , " he said .
" it is not the case for the others . " turkey was " the most complicated situation " said the romanian leader who nevertheless hailed ankara 's progress .
" if they feel rejected there will be a huge possibility to see turkey turning to another type of behavior -lrb- given its -rrb- geographical position , " said tariceanu .
" so we have to be very open when considering turkey as a future partner of the european union . " tariceanu already a constitution fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is currently at a dead end when asked on his views on the eu constitution , the romanian leader said he rejected calls by the dutch government to radically slim down and rename the failed document in order to get it approved .
" i do n't think this is the solution , frankly speaking , " he said .
romania approved the treaty under terms for membership . but he admitted it would be " quite complicated " to find a way to win approval for the constitution which needs a green light from all eu members to enter into force . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria get go-ahead for eu membership the european commission gave the green light tuesday for bulgaria and romania to join the eu on jan .

merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .
all of the 25 eu member states must approve the constitution for it to come into effect . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german delegation to tehran faces dead end in nuclear conflict a group of german parliamentarians is in tehran this week to help defuse the ongoing conflict over iran 's nuclear program .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .
all of the 25 eu member states must approve the constitution for it to come into effect . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german delegation to tehran faces dead end in nuclear conflict a group of german parliamentarians is in tehran this week to help defuse the ongoing conflict over iran 's nuclear program .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

" the safeguard clauses are applied to old members .
so we have the same treatment , " tariceanu said , adding : " do n't consider romania or even bulgaria being a second class member . " under the terms for accession to the eu bloc , regular reports will be filed to brussels on romanian and bulgarian compliance with eu rules .
safeguard clauses will allow the eu to withhold aid funds if either country fails to adhere to treaty obligations .
the eu can also ban the import of goods from both countries if they fail to meet eu standards . officials in brussels say that while safeguard clauses apply to all member states , they are being especially applied in the cases of romania and bulgaria . germany 's presidency may be tough on new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants assurances from the new eu members merkel warned that her government may demand extra measures from romania and bulgaria when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in january to improve justice and home affairs standards prior to the new year admission of both countries . the german chancellor told reporters she had asked european commission president jose manuel barroso to report to berlin in late december on whether both romania and bulgaria have rectified what she termed " deficits in interior and justice policies . " " how the commission reports to us ... will determine whether germany demands any measures or not , " said merkel .
she did not specify what steps berlin might seek from bucharest and sofia . last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , voted in favor of allowing romania and bulgaria to join the eu and merkel said she was confident the bundesrat upper house would do the same later this month .
" romania has made great efforts to join the eu , " she said . romanian leader accepts eu skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tariceanu knows the eu will be watching tariceanu admitted it was necessary to create confidence in the old eu states regarding romania and bulgaria 's implementation of european standards . turning to the question of further eu enlargement including potential accession candidates croatia , turkey and macedonia , tariceanu said it was clear there was reluctance to take in more states after the bloc expands to 27 members with the admission of romania and bulgaria .
" probably europe needs a break now , " he said . but tariceanu stressed that applicant states needed to given a european perspective to keep up incentives for building stronger democratic institutions and free markets . " croatia ... is a country that from my point of view can be prepared to join very soon , " he said .
" it is not the case for the others . " turkey was " the most complicated situation " said the romanian leader who nevertheless hailed ankara 's progress .
" if they feel rejected there will be a huge possibility to see turkey turning to another type of behavior -lrb- given its -rrb- geographical position , " said tariceanu .
" so we have to be very open when considering turkey as a future partner of the european union . " tariceanu already a constitution fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution is currently at a dead end when asked on his views on the eu constitution , the romanian leader said he rejected calls by the dutch government to radically slim down and rename the failed document in order to get it approved .
" i do n't think this is the solution , frankly speaking , " he said .
romania approved the treaty under terms for membership . but he admitted it would be " quite complicated " to find a way to win approval for the constitution which needs a green light from all eu members to enter into force . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania , bulgaria get go-ahead for eu membership the european commission gave the green light tuesday for bulgaria and romania to join the eu on jan .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .
all of the 25 eu member states must approve the constitution for it to come into effect . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german delegation to tehran faces dead end in nuclear conflict a group of german parliamentarians is in tehran this week to help defuse the ongoing conflict over iran 's nuclear program .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

" ackermann , 58 , stands accused along with five other top-ranking executives of breach of fiduciary duty for signing off on the bonuses . the case put executive pay in germany in the spotlight and raised ethical questions about the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a huge mobile telecommunications group . would quit if found guilty although the six defendants were initially acquitted in july 2004 , the federal constitutional court ordered a retrial at the end of last year .

in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann was a member of the group 's supervisory board . he has become a highly unpopular figure in germany , and was lambasted for slashing thousands of jobs while deutsche bank posted record profits . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

the trip to the zoo , navigating along canals and streams that lead from the swans ' home on the city 's aasee lake , began thursday and is to be completed on nov .

peter was said to have paddled obediently alongside as the object of his affection throughout journey . peter has been stalking the boat - a 2-meter -lrb- 6.6-foot -rrb- high , white , fiberglass structure shaped like a swan - since the springtime . staff at the zoo believe the winter break may cure peter 's obsession .
and if the weather does n't do it , zoo staff are relying on the other six black swans in the zoo 's collection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.11.2006 " armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung can expect a warm welcome from his israeli counterpart in an interview with dw-radio , middle east analyst gil yaron talks about german defense minister franz josef jung 's visit to israel on friday , where he is meeting with his israeli counterpart , amir peretz . dw-radio : can jung expect a warm welcome from peretz , despite the recent " misunderstandings " between the israeli air force and german ships patrolling off the lebanese coast ? gil yaron : the germans enjoy one of the highest credits and are the most trusted by israel .
most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .
he writes regularly for the israel news web site www.ynetnews.com and several german and austrian newspapers . john kluempers interviewed gil yaron -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jung visits middle east as pressure mounts over foreign missions german defense minister franz joseph jung visits beirut and tel aviv this week as pressure grows on the minister to resign after a string of high profile blunders concerning german military deployments overseas .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .
he writes regularly for the israel news web site www.ynetnews.com and several german and austrian newspapers . john kluempers interviewed gil yaron -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jung visits middle east as pressure mounts over foreign missions german defense minister franz joseph jung visits beirut and tel aviv this week as pressure grows on the minister to resign after a string of high profile blunders concerning german military deployments overseas .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .

" the prime minister will want to talk about how to take forward the work on energy and climate change as priorities for the eu and g8 , " a british spokesman told the afp news agency . for her part , however , merkel is expected to push the discussions with blair on foreign policy , including situations in the middle east , darfur and iran , where both britain and germany are among six countries grappling to defuse a standoff with tehran over its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to negotiate a replacement for the kyoto protocol before leaving office but that is unlikely to stop blair from bearing down on climate change , which a spokesperson said he sees as a critical part of europe 's overall security . the prime minister believes there is a " real opportunity " for the eu to agree a new energy and climate change strategy , the spokesperson added . fighting climate change and pushing for a new international pact against global warming will be near the top of the agenda friday evening .
merkel , a former environment minister in the cabinet of former chancellor helmut kohl , indicated she would make climate change a priority next year , especially while germany hold the six-month rotating eu presidency . environmental pact must include the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft is a fast growing contributor to climate change " there is a real opportunity for the bloc to agree on a bold new european energy and climate strategy that reduces our dependence on carbon fuels , increases the diversity of energy supplies and increases energy efficiency based on new clean technologies , " a blair spokesman told reuters on friday . experts said it could take at least three years to negotiate a successor to the un 's kyoto protocol that calls for curbing greenhouse emissions , and runs out by 2012 .
according to the britain 's the independent , blair has set himself the task of negotiating a replacement for the kyoto agreement before he is expected to leave office next year . both blair and merkel agree that a post-kyoto framework must include the united states , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , as well as huge developing nations such as india and china . foreign policy , eu construction also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a topic whenever european leaders meet the leaders are also likely to discuss afghanistan , where taliban fighters have mounted an increasingly deadly campaign against british-led nato forces in the south .
germany also has a major presence there . the future of the eu constitution is also expected to be on the agenda friday evening .
merkel said her government would concentrate on working out a timeline for the revival of the constitution , which was by voters in france and the netherlands last year . britain , which did not take a vote on ratifying the document , is opposed to bringing the constitution back to life in its current form .

" ackermann , 58 , stands accused along with five other top-ranking executives of breach of fiduciary duty for signing off on the bonuses . the case put executive pay in germany in the spotlight and raised ethical questions about the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a huge mobile telecommunications group . would quit if found guilty although the six defendants were initially acquitted in july 2004 , the federal constitutional court ordered a retrial at the end of last year .

in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann was a member of the group 's supervisory board . he has become a highly unpopular figure in germany , and was lambasted for slashing thousands of jobs while deutsche bank posted record profits . dw staff / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief faces retrial in mannesmann case germany 's most powerful banker is due back in court on thursday in the latest round of the country 's biggest ever corporate crime trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 03.11.2006 " armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung can expect a warm welcome from his israeli counterpart in an interview with dw-radio , middle east analyst gil yaron talks about german defense minister franz josef jung 's visit to israel on friday , where he is meeting with his israeli counterpart , amir peretz . dw-radio : can jung expect a warm welcome from peretz , despite the recent " misunderstandings " between the israeli air force and german ships patrolling off the lebanese coast ? gil yaron : the germans enjoy one of the highest credits and are the most trusted by israel .
most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .
he writes regularly for the israel news web site www.ynetnews.com and several german and austrian newspapers . john kluempers interviewed gil yaron -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jung visits middle east as pressure mounts over foreign missions german defense minister franz joseph jung visits beirut and tel aviv this week as pressure grows on the minister to resign after a string of high profile blunders concerning german military deployments overseas .

most of the israeli spokespeople are very sorry about the misunderstandings and the incidences that have occurred in the week before .
so they will make sure to make their guests comfortable , and one of the purposes of this visit is to establish a mechanism that will prevent such incidences in the future . many germans parliamentarians are upset about the unclear nature of the un mandate in lebanon and off its coast .
what must jung and peretz do to make this more robust ? it is up to jung and peretz to make this mandate more robust and it is something that is much bigger than just the two of them - it is something that the international community has to enforce . indeed there is a lot of room for interpretation for the un mandate which actually enables the un force in lebanon to do everything in its capacity to stop hezbollah from using military force against israel .
the question is : what really is its capacity .
when you ask different people , you get different answers and that is exactly the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah should be stopped from using force against israel , yaron said it has been reported that the lebanese people are wondering just what purpose the un troops are serving in lebanon .
is this also a question in israel and is the israeli population thinking a lot about the un mandate ? definitely , it is one of the essential questions because this will determine who has , in the end , won this lebanon war , which both sides claim to have won to some extent .
but signs at the moment are not very encouraging .
for the israelis , there are several incidences in which international troops have been turned back by hezbollah troops in southern lebanon , and no one allowed them to use force in order to force their way through .
so the freedom of movement for un troops has been limited . there are talks that even the freedom of movement of the war ships in the waters off lebanon has been restricted because of hezbollah 's influence over the lebanese government .
probably the most concerning issue in the arms shipments that are coming through the syrian and lebanese border .
that is actually re-arming hezbollah to its pre-war levels and even higher . should more pressure then be put on the un to also secure this border ? well , yes , but they made it very clear they would only be doing that if the lebanese government asks them to , and since there are hezbollah ministers within the lebanese government , it 's very unlikely that the lebanese government , or hezbollah in effect , is actually going to authorize someone to hinder its rearmament after the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un must take a firmer stance in the conflict , according to yaron in the past few days the topic of israeli air force flights over lebanon has been raised .
will this just raise tensions ? tensions are high as we speak and the israelis say that they will continue and keep up their flights as long as un resolution 1701 is not implemented .
one has to remember , this whole war broke out because hezbollah actually attacked israel and abducted two of its soldiers .
now the end resolution , even in its preamble , is asking for those soldiers to be returned to israel , which has n't actually happened yet .
the other thing that the un resolution is talking about is the enforcement of the arms embargo and the disarmament of hezbollah .
the israelis are saying that as long as those three key points have not been implemented , they will not stop their flights over lebanon simply to ascertain that should hezbollah strike out again they know where to strike . is an armed conflict a distinct possibility in the near future ? a think an armed conflict is more likely than continuation of the calm .
both sides are now preparing for the next round , with hezbollah and israel saying it 's coming simply because the last round of violence did not lead to a conclusion and simply because the international force , the unifil force and the un are not doing a good enough job in order to prevent both sides from arming themselves again and becoming interested in the next round . are the lebanese right to think that the un is being used by israel to achieve israeli goals ? it depends who you ask , because when you ask israelis they say the un is actually helping hezbollah to fulfill its goals .
that is exactly the problem : when you get into a war and get into the middle and do n't help one side very , very clearly , you get accusations . gil yaron is a freelance journalist and middle east analyst based in tel aviv .

nearly half a century on , tony blair is to call for more of the same .
he told me that now , more than ever , our economic future is through " the brilliant light of science " .
the prime minister is a late convert to science .
by his own admission , he was n't good at science subjects in school .
but now he 's grown to love it .
the country 's future , he says , lies " through science and technology helping us - not just to gain more benefits in terms of material possessions and consumer goods which obviously are very important to people ; but also things like the environment .
" we wo n't solve climate change without the best scientific minds .
" we 're not going to be able to treat people for diseases unless we have the best scientific minds . "
unfinished business this is a prime minister with a mission . "
i want to enthuse our young people particularly with the prospect of working in science " tony blair pm 's call for young scientists he seems to have an urgency about him to get through unfinished business before his term of office comes to an end .
before he goes , he wants to sell science to the nation , particularly to the young .
" i want to enthuse our young people particularly with the prospect of working in science .
" it 's not just about being a boffin in a laboratory - it 's actually about practical application and transforming lives , tackling the world 's problems and doing so in a very practical way . "

the move will see cruise produce at least four films a year as well as taking an unspecified stake in the company - known for nurturing talent .
it comes three months after he severed ties with paramount pictures after a 14-year working relationship .
paramount said that cruise 's recent behaviour had been " unacceptable " .
it is believed that cruise 's high-profile relationship with katie holmes and his views on subjects such as anti-depressants were behind the fallout with paramount .
' biggest star ' cruise 's business partner at paramount , paula wagner , is also moving to united artists as its chief executive officer .
" we were looking for a strategic partner -lrb- for ua -rrb- and we 've found a strategic partner and it just so happens that he 's the biggest star in the world , " said mgm spokesman jeff pryor .
during the past decade , cruise 's films - which include the three mission : impossible movies - have generated more than $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1.5bn -rrb- worldwide .
but the third mission : impossible film put in a relatively disappointing performance at the box office .
despite this , the 44-year-old actor was named the world 's most powerful celebrity by us magazine forbes earlier this year .

the move will see cruise produce at least four films a year as well as taking an unspecified stake in the company - known for nurturing talent .
it comes three months after he severed ties with paramount pictures after a 14-year working relationship .
paramount said that cruise 's recent behaviour had been " unacceptable " .
it is believed that cruise 's high-profile relationship with katie holmes and his views on subjects such as anti-depressants were behind the fallout with paramount .
' biggest star ' cruise 's business partner at paramount , paula wagner , is also moving to united artists as its chief executive officer .
" we were looking for a strategic partner -lrb- for ua -rrb- and we 've found a strategic partner and it just so happens that he 's the biggest star in the world , " said mgm spokesman jeff pryor .
during the past decade , cruise 's films - which include the three mission : impossible movies - have generated more than $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1.5bn -rrb- worldwide .
but the third mission : impossible film put in a relatively disappointing performance at the box office .
despite this , the 44-year-old actor was named the world 's most powerful celebrity by us magazine forbes earlier this year .

kim , was found guilty of charges earlier this year , but will now serve eight-and-a-half years in prison rather than 10 .
the 69-year-old also had the amount he must repay reduced from 21 trillion won -lrb- £ 22bn ; £ 11.7bn -rrb- to 17.9 trillion won .
at one time of the crimes , daewoo was among south korea 's largest firms .
punishment ' deserved ' the group collapsed in 1999 under debts of more than $ 80bn and kim fled the country , only returning in 2005 .
prosecutors called for a longer sentence , alleging he had bribed government officials and politicians to grow his empire and get bank loans .
however , judge suk ho-chui said there was no evidence of this .
" he deserves heavy punishment as the collapse of daewoo group caused enormous damage to our economy , but we should consider his age , ailment , repentance and contribution to our economy , " the judge said .
" a reduced jail term is given in consideration of his pain for watching daewoo group 's collapse .
" despite being a criminal , the defendant is remembered among the korean public as an entrepreneur who raised the status of the country . "

when politicians spend money they shout it from the rooftops .
business works in quieter ways and while this investment is big it 's nowhere near the scale of that already invested by southern companies in northern ireland over the past few years .
the republic of ireland is to spend 700m euros on ni 's infrastructure .
whether it 's bringing gas to the north west , electricity to coolkeragh or even a little baileys irish cream direct from its newtownabbey factory , the southern stake in the northern ranch is a vital part of business life .
is there a cogent explanation for this investment pattern ?
two features stand out .
first , the momentum of investment from south to north has increased in recent years .
second , the range of investments is wide .
the explanation : no business expands its cross-border investment unless it sees a prospect of a profitable return on capital .
why does northern ireland seem a better prospect now ?
the logic of these decisions can be linked to the wider political and business environment .
whilst the troubles were at their worst , investing in northern ireland was deterred , plants closed and some investors retreated .
the process has now been reversed .
business investors have greater confidence that the economy of northern ireland is becoming more stable : market prospects and market share are now more influential determinants .
the politicians might not yet make a dramatic claim that they have done the economy a ' power of good ' .
however , the behaviour of irish -lrb- and british -rrb- investors is a growing vote of confidence that an acceptable level of political stability is in prospect .
many other businesses have had a longer cross-border connection .
the four main banks are big players both north and south .
there are many cross-border issues in the banking business still to be solved .
the existence of two currencies has long been an inconvenience for cross border transactions .
the four clearing banks have the unusual privilege that they can profitably print their own sterling bank notes in northern ireland .
investors were previously put off by the troubles bank of ireland , aib -lrb- including first trust -rrb- , and the ulster bank all have extensive branch networks on both sides of the border and have an irish headquarters in dublin .
the northern bank is now danish-owned and is part of the same group as the national irish bank .
dunnes stores has operated profitably on both sides of the border for many years .
musgrave distribution and musgrave supervalu-centra are subsidiaries of the cork-based musgrave group .
c & c -lrb- cantrell and cochrane -rrb- was originally a belfast owned firm but is now part of an all-ireland group , with modern plant producing magners , in clonmel .
old bushmills is a profitable subsidiary now owned through the irish part of the diageo group .
glen electric , now a major international player , started in northern ireland in newry and then bangor as a spin-off from another firm in dunleer .
sangers , the wholesale supplier to the pharmaceutical businesses is now a subsidiary of united drug , its dublin-based irish parent company .
is the investment flow all one way : south to north ?
not all one way , but mainly one way .
some northern investors have put money in businesses in the south .
hastings hotels has a top quality shared investment in dublin in the merrion hotel .
the quinn group from derrylin have expanded their extensive network of investments , north and south , including hotels and insurance .
viridian is a big player in the electricity generation market in dublin with new plants at huntstown .
several large construction businesses from the north have been winning large contracts across the border , including grahams -lrb- of dromore -rrb- , gilbert ash and the lagan group .
what has all this business investment cost ?
estimates are not easy to make .
baileys irish cream now has a factory in newtownabbey including the notional investment by the two irish-controlled banks , the potential realisable value -lrb- which is a very hypothetical concept -rrb- must be near to £ 3.5bn.
excluding the banks , the other business assets owned by investors from south of the border might well be assessed at over £ 1.5bn.
cross-border business is alive , profitable and expanding but do n't tell the politicians ; they 'll only take all the credit !
the following businesses have each recently developed or expanded their business investments in northern ireland .
baileys irish cream liqueur , in a new factory in newtownabbey bge , in the new natural gas pipeline to the north west esb , as a major investor in the new electricity generation plant at coolkeragh crh , as the owners of northstone -lrb- farrans -rrb- , the largest local construction firm titanic quarter , where harcourt developments leads in urban regeneration the quinn group , expanding output of glass bottles and building materials kerry group -lrb- former golden vale subsidiaries -rrb- , with kerrygold , dairy produce packers -lrb- of coleraine -rrb- and the denny bacon and sausage factory -lrb- craigavon -rrb- glanbia , making mozzeralla cheese at mageralin the tower hotel group , with a new hotel in derry city town of monaghan co-op , taking over some dairying from leckpatrick lakeland dairies , who have purchased pritchitts in newtownards iaws , whose franchise for cuisine de france has expanded , and independent news and media , now owning the belfast telegraph as well as the irish independent the most recent example of the changing business network was the merger of three medium sized accountancy firms to form the sixth largest all island network : mcclure watters -lrb- belfast -rrb- have merged with fgs -lrb- farrell grant sparks , dublin -rrb- and lyons keenan kilenade -lrb- longford -rrb- .
of course the other " big four " , -lrb- pwc , kpmg , deloitte & touche , ernst and young -rrb- already have large business offices , north and south .

when politicians spend money they shout it from the rooftops .
business works in quieter ways and while this investment is big it 's nowhere near the scale of that already invested by southern companies in northern ireland over the past few years .
the republic of ireland is to spend 700m euros on ni 's infrastructure .
whether it 's bringing gas to the north west , electricity to coolkeragh or even a little baileys irish cream direct from its newtownabbey factory , the southern stake in the northern ranch is a vital part of business life .
is there a cogent explanation for this investment pattern ?
two features stand out .
first , the momentum of investment from south to north has increased in recent years .
second , the range of investments is wide .
the explanation : no business expands its cross-border investment unless it sees a prospect of a profitable return on capital .
why does northern ireland seem a better prospect now ?
the logic of these decisions can be linked to the wider political and business environment .
whilst the troubles were at their worst , investing in northern ireland was deterred , plants closed and some investors retreated .
the process has now been reversed .
business investors have greater confidence that the economy of northern ireland is becoming more stable : market prospects and market share are now more influential determinants .
the politicians might not yet make a dramatic claim that they have done the economy a ' power of good ' .
however , the behaviour of irish -lrb- and british -rrb- investors is a growing vote of confidence that an acceptable level of political stability is in prospect .

there are many cross-border issues in the banking business still to be solved .
the existence of two currencies has long been an inconvenience for cross border transactions .

when politicians spend money they shout it from the rooftops .
business works in quieter ways and while this investment is big it 's nowhere near the scale of that already invested by southern companies in northern ireland over the past few years .
the republic of ireland is to spend 700m euros on ni 's infrastructure .
whether it 's bringing gas to the north west , electricity to coolkeragh or even a little baileys irish cream direct from its newtownabbey factory , the southern stake in the northern ranch is a vital part of business life .
is there a cogent explanation for this investment pattern ?
two features stand out .
first , the momentum of investment from south to north has increased in recent years .
second , the range of investments is wide .
the explanation : no business expands its cross-border investment unless it sees a prospect of a profitable return on capital .
why does northern ireland seem a better prospect now ?
the logic of these decisions can be linked to the wider political and business environment .
whilst the troubles were at their worst , investing in northern ireland was deterred , plants closed and some investors retreated .
the process has now been reversed .
business investors have greater confidence that the economy of northern ireland is becoming more stable : market prospects and market share are now more influential determinants .
the politicians might not yet make a dramatic claim that they have done the economy a ' power of good ' .
however , the behaviour of irish -lrb- and british -rrb- investors is a growing vote of confidence that an acceptable level of political stability is in prospect .
many other businesses have had a longer cross-border connection .
the four main banks are big players both north and south .
there are many cross-border issues in the banking business still to be solved .
the existence of two currencies has long been an inconvenience for cross border transactions .
the four clearing banks have the unusual privilege that they can profitably print their own sterling bank notes in northern ireland .
investors were previously put off by the troubles bank of ireland , aib -lrb- including first trust -rrb- , and the ulster bank all have extensive branch networks on both sides of the border and have an irish headquarters in dublin .
the northern bank is now danish-owned and is part of the same group as the national irish bank .
dunnes stores has operated profitably on both sides of the border for many years .
musgrave distribution and musgrave supervalu-centra are subsidiaries of the cork-based musgrave group .
c & c -lrb- cantrell and cochrane -rrb- was originally a belfast owned firm but is now part of an all-ireland group , with modern plant producing magners , in clonmel .
old bushmills is a profitable subsidiary now owned through the irish part of the diageo group .
glen electric , now a major international player , started in northern ireland in newry and then bangor as a spin-off from another firm in dunleer .
sangers , the wholesale supplier to the pharmaceutical businesses is now a subsidiary of united drug , its dublin-based irish parent company .
is the investment flow all one way : south to north ?
not all one way , but mainly one way .
some northern investors have put money in businesses in the south .
hastings hotels has a top quality shared investment in dublin in the merrion hotel .
the quinn group from derrylin have expanded their extensive network of investments , north and south , including hotels and insurance .
viridian is a big player in the electricity generation market in dublin with new plants at huntstown .
several large construction businesses from the north have been winning large contracts across the border , including grahams -lrb- of dromore -rrb- , gilbert ash and the lagan group .
what has all this business investment cost ?
estimates are not easy to make .
baileys irish cream now has a factory in newtownabbey including the notional investment by the two irish-controlled banks , the potential realisable value -lrb- which is a very hypothetical concept -rrb- must be near to £ 3.5bn.
excluding the banks , the other business assets owned by investors from south of the border might well be assessed at over £ 1.5bn.
cross-border business is alive , profitable and expanding but do n't tell the politicians ; they 'll only take all the credit !
the following businesses have each recently developed or expanded their business investments in northern ireland .
baileys irish cream liqueur , in a new factory in newtownabbey bge , in the new natural gas pipeline to the north west esb , as a major investor in the new electricity generation plant at coolkeragh crh , as the owners of northstone -lrb- farrans -rrb- , the largest local construction firm titanic quarter , where harcourt developments leads in urban regeneration the quinn group , expanding output of glass bottles and building materials kerry group -lrb- former golden vale subsidiaries -rrb- , with kerrygold , dairy produce packers -lrb- of coleraine -rrb- and the denny bacon and sausage factory -lrb- craigavon -rrb- glanbia , making mozzeralla cheese at mageralin the tower hotel group , with a new hotel in derry city town of monaghan co-op , taking over some dairying from leckpatrick lakeland dairies , who have purchased pritchitts in newtownards iaws , whose franchise for cuisine de france has expanded , and independent news and media , now owning the belfast telegraph as well as the irish independent the most recent example of the changing business network was the merger of three medium sized accountancy firms to form the sixth largest all island network : mcclure watters -lrb- belfast -rrb- have merged with fgs -lrb- farrell grant sparks , dublin -rrb- and lyons keenan kilenade -lrb- longford -rrb- .

taxotere can improve the quality of life of patients in the later stages of the cancer , and prolong their lives .
it was approved in june by the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- for use in the nhs in england and wales .
but each course costs about £ 7,000 and the prostate cancer charity says some men are denied it on cost grounds .
it can not be acceptable that men and their families who are already having to deal with the tough news of a prostate cancer diagnosis , have to wrestle with nhs bureaucracy at the same time .
john neate prostate cancer charity the charity claims that some doctors have been told to ration the number of courses of taxotere that they prescribe by primary care trusts struggling with limited funds .
taxotere was originally developed to treat breast cancer .
it has been found to extend survival time by 25 % over the standard treatment for men no longer responding to hormone therapy , and cuts pain and weight loss .
more than 30,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the uk each year , and around 10,000 die from it .
thousands of men with disease that has spread to other parts of their body are now supposed to be considered for the drug .
call for action john neate , chief executive of the prostate cancer charity , said " it can not be acceptable that men and their families who are already having to deal with the tough news of a prostate cancer diagnosis , have to wrestle with nhs bureaucracy at the same time .
taxotere patient david rae was diagnosed with terminal cancer two-and-a-half years ago .
he was given taxotere , in combination with another drug , on a clinical trial at queen elizabeth hospital , birmingham .
" in that six months my whole demeanour changed .
my quality of life was vastly improved , " he said .
i was able to get out and about , i went on holiday to scotland , i drove down to greece , i felt so much better .
" if you consider that i was housebound , and could not walk back in march , that was a magnificent transformation . "
" yes , there are cost implications and yes , i do understand the challenges for pcts in balancing their books and in meeting the inexorably rising public demand for wider treatment choices .
" but we know that prostate cancer is catching up from a very low base and it deserves to be given special recognition for that in funding decisions . "
hormone therapies are typically used to treat prostate cancer , but they usually only work for up to three years .
with no further treatment , a patient might expect to live for about another year .
another drug , mitoxantrone , can help - but has been out-performed by taxotere in trials .
the drug , known technically as docetaxel , works by blocking the mechanism that allows cells to divide .
taxotere can cause side effects such as flushing , skin rash , chest tightness , back pain , anaemia , nausea , sore mouth and taste change , diarrhoea , hair loss , hypersensitivity and tiredness .
other services mr neate , speaking at the national prostate cancer conference in london , said patients were also being denied access to other specialist treatments , such as brachytherapy -lrb- a type of radiotherapy -rrb- .
men with prostate cancer get a very raw deal professor nick james there was also a failure to provide consistent access to specialist nurses , he said .
professor nick james , of the university of birmingham , said primary care trusts would not dare to treat women with breast cancer in the same way that they treated men with prostate cancer for fear of attracting negative media headlines .
" essentially men with prostate cancer get a very raw deal .
the people who make these funding decisions make them with one eye on how it is going to play in the media . "
a department of health spokesman said : " a recent report showed an improvement in access to nice approved drugs across the country .
" though some trusts may be under financial pressure , and may need to make difficult decisions , this will not have an adverse effect on patient care . "

branded " reliance fresh " , they are part of a $ 5bn project planned for more than 780 cities and 6,000 rural towns in india over the next five years .
the company aims to open stores in the top 70 cities within the next two years and have sales of $ 25bn by 2011 .
about 95 % of india 's retail sector is made up of small , family-run stores and has not been tapped by big business .
there have been worries that reliance 's move will adversely affect the 12 million traditional indian traders and shop keepers .
' affordable ' the first reliance shops , selling fresh vegetables , fruit , flowers and other groceries were formally launched in the up-market banjara hills area of hyderabad in southern india .
" this marks our first step in a long journey in to the organized retail business " , said raghu pillai , president of operations and strategy at reliance retail .
reliance , whose interests range from petrochemicals to power , has an ambitious supply chain plan , integrating farmers with the shops . "
i am impressed by the hygienic conditions and the way the things are packaged " afsana ahmad , customer " our intention is to bring high quality fresh food to the customers at an affordable price , " said gunender kapur , head of reliance 's food business .
this makes sense in a country where about 40 % of the vegetable and fruits produced perishes before reaching the markets .
reliance chairman mukesh ambani , who visited all 11 shops on the eve of opening , said his firm offered " unmatched affordability , quality and choice of products and services to the customers " .
' hygienic ' customer rajni srinivasan told the bbc she was impressed with the shops .
" the prices of some of the vegetables is around 40 % less than the other shops .
i hope it is just not a promotion and that they will continue with this " .
another customer , afsana ahmad , said the " ambience " of the shop was different to other stores .
" i am impressed by the hygienic conditions and the way the things are packaged .
it is good and affordable " .
other business houses such as rpg , tata and bharati have their own plans for the retail business reliance 's move has generated a lot of excitement and interest across india as it has come at a time when the country 's economy is booming and india 's 300 million strong middle class has caught the attention of the world .
its retail business plans stretch beyond groceries and other day-to-day requirements to financial services , insurance and entertainment through the other formats like hyper markets and specialty stores .
international retail chains including wal-mart , carrefour and tesco have yet to grab a slice of the indian retail business .
' winning combination ' mr pillai said that there was room in the retail sector for traditional sellers and bigger firms .
" retail market size in the country today is $ 300bn and it is growing at 8 % .
" we want to do $ 25bn of business in five years - and this will not be capturing the full growth . "
the firm expects to employ 500,000 staff as well as creating at least one million jobs indirectly .
the head of agricultural business at reliance retail , sanjeev asthana , said that farmers would benefit from the company 's move into retail .
" our partnership with farmers is aimed at creating a winning combination , " he said .
" we want to create a system in which the farmers get not only timely payment but also get good extension service quality input and cutting edge technology .
" the overall income of the farmers should go up " .

ben bradshaw said the warning , issued by scientists on thursday , represented the world 's biggest environmental challenge after global warming .
but he ruled out a complete ban on cod fishing , saying a " zero catch " would see " the end of all fishing in the uk " .
uk fishermen 's representatives have criticised the report as " grandiose " .
the international study , published in the american journal , science , said supplies of fish such as cod were under threat from over-fishing and habitat destruction .
the government had already clamped down on illegal fishing and set fishing quotas " in line with the health of stocks " , mr bradshaw said .
the good news in the report is that there is a solution willie mackenzie greenpeace ' only 50 years ' for sea fish uk fishing industry in figures " if there were to be a zero catch for cod , we would have to close almost all of the uk fishing industry because there 's almost no part of our fishing industry that does n't catch some cod as by-catch . "
measures taken in recent years had seen a 60 % decrease in cod mortality rates , he said , which hopefully would continue .
dr nicola beaumont from plymouth marine laboratory was one of the scientists who helped draw up the report .
she said it was not just about fishing , but pollution , climate change , ocean acidification and destruction of marine habitats .
sceptical greenpeace campaigner willie mackenzie said fish and chips would be off the menu " within our lifetime " if action was not taken now to tackle the problem .
" the good news in the report is that there is a solution .
it proves that creating protected marine reserves , off-limits to industry and fishing , help fish populations to bounce back , " he said .
but people working within the uk 's fishing industry were sceptical about the report .

chris sparks , from a grimsby fish company called james and son , said : " we do n't believe this report at all .
" the industry 's coming under increasing pressure , but there 's still good stocks out there , well-managed stocks , which are managed by forward-thinking people , trying to keep up with the modern industry . "
doug beveridge , of the national federation of fishermen 's organisations , said : " we have to be very careful about making grandiose , broad-brush predictions for 40 or 50 years and on a global scale also . "
fisheries and the marine environment could be managed regionally " on a collaborative basis with the fishing industry " , he added .
consumers have been urged to press restaurants and fish and chip shops to stock sustainable species .
and the british retail consortium said the uk 's major supermarkets had increased their stocks of non-threatened fish , but this was a global problem .

uk fishermen 's representatives have criticised the report as " grandiose " .
the international study , published in the american journal , science , said supplies of fish such as cod were under threat from over-fishing and habitat destruction .
the government had already clamped down on illegal fishing and set fishing quotas " in line with the health of stocks " , mr bradshaw said .
the good news in the report is that there is a solution willie mackenzie greenpeace ' only 50 years ' for sea fish uk fishing industry in figures " if there were to be a zero catch for cod , we would have to close almost all of the uk fishing industry because there 's almost no part of our fishing industry that does n't catch some cod as by-catch . "
measures taken in recent years had seen a 60 % decrease in cod mortality rates , he said , which hopefully would continue .
dr nicola beaumont from plymouth marine laboratory was one of the scientists who helped draw up the report .
she said it was not just about fishing , but pollution , climate change , ocean acidification and destruction of marine habitats .
sceptical greenpeace campaigner willie mackenzie said fish and chips would be off the menu " within our lifetime " if action was not taken now to tackle the problem .
" the good news in the report is that there is a solution .
it proves that creating protected marine reserves , off-limits to industry and fishing , help fish populations to bounce back , " he said .
but people working within the uk 's fishing industry were sceptical about the report .

chris sparks , from a grimsby fish company called james and son , said : " we do n't believe this report at all .
" the industry 's coming under increasing pressure , but there 's still good stocks out there , well-managed stocks , which are managed by forward-thinking people , trying to keep up with the modern industry . "
doug beveridge , of the national federation of fishermen 's organisations , said : " we have to be very careful about making grandiose , broad-brush predictions for 40 or 50 years and on a global scale also . "
fisheries and the marine environment could be managed regionally " on a collaborative basis with the fishing industry " , he added .
consumers have been urged to press restaurants and fish and chip shops to stock sustainable species .
and the british retail consortium said the uk 's major supermarkets had increased their stocks of non-threatened fish , but this was a global problem .
