the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .

" sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 german music concert cancelled under pressure from right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing radicals are taking the fight to local municipality level the eastern german town of halberstadt buckled under pressure from the extreme right and called off a concert by konstantin wecker .
politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .
" we need to continue with our work , and we are discussing the topic in depth with the christian democratic union , " annen said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police carry out major raids of skinhead group in germany police across germany staged raids against the outlawed skinhead group blood and honor and identified several suspects believed to be managing its activities underground .

some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .
now france - and maybe germany - aims to develop a eurocentric alternative to the dominant internet search engine , google . checking a fact ?
planning a vacation ?
want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .
but citing the lagging interest in umts , analysts are skeptical .
" consumers are not looking for quicker versions of umts , but a good reason why they should even use umts , " said vincent ohana of the technology consulting group eurospace in an interview with television station ard . robbie williams , yes ; soccer , no analysts are just as skeptical about the number of people who will actually take advantage of the world cup offers by t-mobile and o2 . though 100,000 customers tuned in to watch a live broadcast of a robbie williams concert last fall , interest in soccer - which does n't play well on a small screen - could be limited . t-mobile is perhaps hoping analysis and highlight clips provided by german pay tv channel premiere , which currently holds the rights to german and european soccer , will sweeten the deal . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest high-tech fair opens in germany the world 's biggest high-tech fair , cebit , opens thursday , showcasing the latest in robotics , computers and consumer electronics to make gadget fans ' hearts beat faster .

forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .

" google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .

germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .

they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .

" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said .

some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .
now france - and maybe germany - aims to develop a eurocentric alternative to the dominant internet search engine , google . checking a fact ?
planning a vacation ?
want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .
but citing the lagging interest in umts , analysts are skeptical .
" consumers are not looking for quicker versions of umts , but a good reason why they should even use umts , " said vincent ohana of the technology consulting group eurospace in an interview with television station ard . robbie williams , yes ; soccer , no analysts are just as skeptical about the number of people who will actually take advantage of the world cup offers by t-mobile and o2 . though 100,000 customers tuned in to watch a live broadcast of a robbie williams concert last fall , interest in soccer - which does n't play well on a small screen - could be limited . t-mobile is perhaps hoping analysis and highlight clips provided by german pay tv channel premiere , which currently holds the rights to german and european soccer , will sweeten the deal . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest high-tech fair opens in germany the world 's biggest high-tech fair , cebit , opens thursday , showcasing the latest in robotics , computers and consumer electronics to make gadget fans ' hearts beat faster .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .

" the cebit is focusing on rfid this year because in the future , all processing , for example in the field of logistics , will be changed beyond recognition , " raue said . the global market for rfid chips is expected to go through the roof in the coming years , with turnover likely to quadruple to 5.5 billion euros by 2008 , according to independent research firm idtechex . sea-change in telecommunications willi berchtold , the president of bitkom , which represents more than 1,000 german it , telecommunication and consumer electronics companies , told reporters that a sea-change in telecommunications was having a ripple effect throughout the industry , noting that land-line services - a 20-billion-euro industry in germany - were giving way to mobile and internet telephony . " mobile phone calls have become so cheap that many people are even using them at home , " he said , noting the price had dropped an average of 10 percent in the last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans are dropping land lines and just use their mobile phones meanwhile high-speed internet servicess via dsl or tv cable are skyrocketing , with the number of connections climbing 56 percent to 10.7 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 german music concert cancelled under pressure from right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing radicals are taking the fight to local municipality level the eastern german town of halberstadt buckled under pressure from the extreme right and called off a concert by konstantin wecker .
politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .

" there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation .

the constitution was rejected by dutch and french voters in referendums last year . gay activists delay speech during a visit to berlin 's humboldt university , where kaczynski toned down his comments on the eu somewhat , gay rights activists disrupted the polish leader 's speech to protest what they called his " homophobic policies .

" the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .
bookworms will be able to run through a similar scanner and , with a chip in each volume , skip long check-out lines at the library . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doctors carry scanners in the future ?
and patients will eventually be able to have rfid chips implanted in their bodies , allowing any attending doctor to call up his or her personal health history at the touch of a button . " the cebit is focusing on rfid this year because in the future , all processing , for example in the field of logistics , will be changed beyond recognition , " raue said . the global market for rfid chips is expected to go through the roof in the coming years , with turnover likely to quadruple to 5.5 billion euros by 2008 , according to independent research firm idtechex . sea-change in telecommunications willi berchtold , the president of bitkom , which represents more than 1,000 german it , telecommunication and consumer electronics companies , told reporters that a sea-change in telecommunications was having a ripple effect throughout the industry , noting that land-line services - a 20-billion-euro industry in germany - were giving way to mobile and internet telephony . " mobile phone calls have become so cheap that many people are even using them at home , " he said , noting the price had dropped an average of 10 percent in the last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans are dropping land lines and just use their mobile phones meanwhile high-speed internet servicess via dsl or tv cable are skyrocketing , with the number of connections climbing 56 percent to 10.7 million . " in the future , the internet , telephony and television will converge , " he said .
" that is not a dream but the next step . " intelligent robots meanwhile germany 's renowned frauenhofer institute and the neurology clinic at berlin 's charite hospital are to unveil a " mental typewriter " that will allow people incapacitated by injury or disease to communicate . using 128 electrodes fastened to the cranium , the invention literally reads minds as the patient uses his thoughts to type out messages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will vacuum cleaners work on their own in the future ?
but cebit would not be complete without a few rather gimmicky gee-whiz inventions including " intelligent " vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers that take care of household chores and return themselves to the charging station . the fair has seen the biggest growth among asian exhibitors , with china , hong kong and south korea all reporting a major jump in companies taking part . next year 's event cebit is expected to attract 1,700 exhibitors from the asian-pacific region - unmatched by any other trade fair in the world , including in asia , according to organizers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on germany 's most important trade fairs .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .
" that is an artificial creation . " the president was completing a two-day visit to germany on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish school children seem more excited about the eu than their president poland , with its 38.6 million inhabitants , is widely considered the most powerful of the newer members of the eu , which expanded to 25 states in 2004 when it allowed mostly eastern european nations into its ranks . but kaczynski , who was elected last year , said it was a myth to think that all europeans had a shared outlook . " there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation . "
the constitution was rejected by dutch and french voters in referendums last year . gay activists delay speech during a visit to berlin 's humboldt university , where kaczynski toned down his comments on the eu somewhat , gay rights activists disrupted the polish leader 's speech to protest what they called his " homophobic policies .

" the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out . " the president provoked the wrath of polish gays when he banned a gay pride march in warsaw last year while still mayor of the capital . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaczynski : good polish-german relations important for europe polish president lech kaczynski said on wednesday that good relations with germany were " important for all of europe " after he met with german chancellor angela merkel on his first visit to berlin .

if it goes through , it could be one of the biggest flotations in germany this year . against the backdrop of the international tourism fair in berlin -lrb- itb -rrb- , air berlin chairman joachim hunold unveiled his airline 's plans for going public . air berlin , which has expanded rapidly in the past 15 years to become germany 's second largest airline following lufthansa , looks to the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- for a fresh cash injection for continued expansion plans . " if we want to continue to grow and expand in the highly competitive european market , we must respond appropriately by going public , " hunold said at a press conference at the itb in berlin on wednesday . biggest growth story of the year although the airline has yet to announce a timeframe for the flotation and hunold has declined to say how big the initial offering will be , experts forecast a start date in the second quarter of 2006 .
sources close to the company have also said the ipo could be worth " at least 500 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- . " recent press reports have suggested that the ipo could raise up to 700 million euros , making it one of the biggest flotations on the german stock exchange this year .

the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only thing they have their eye on is dividends , dividends , dividends , " said matthias wagner , of the dresden tenant 's association , in a spiegel online article . " sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians . " weighing the lesser of two evils still , the deal will likely go through , despite the 45,000 signatures affixed to a petition protesting it .
at the moment 40 of the council 's 70 members are in favor of the pact .
the pds party , the successor to the former east german communist party and the second-largest group in the council , is divided .
of the 17 members , only five are sure to vote against it . " the alternative would be reductions in the social and cultural sector , and who on the left wants that ? "

forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .

" google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 german music concert cancelled under pressure from right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing radicals are taking the fight to local municipality level the eastern german town of halberstadt buckled under pressure from the extreme right and called off a concert by konstantin wecker .
politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 german music concert cancelled under pressure from right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing radicals are taking the fight to local municipality level the eastern german town of halberstadt buckled under pressure from the extreme right and called off a concert by konstantin wecker .
politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .

on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats .

ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .
" that is an artificial creation . " the president was completing a two-day visit to germany on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish school children seem more excited about the eu than their president poland , with its 38.6 million inhabitants , is widely considered the most powerful of the newer members of the eu , which expanded to 25 states in 2004 when it allowed mostly eastern european nations into its ranks . but kaczynski , who was elected last year , said it was a myth to think that all europeans had a shared outlook . " there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation . "
the constitution was rejected by dutch and french voters in referendums last year . gay activists delay speech during a visit to berlin 's humboldt university , where kaczynski toned down his comments on the eu somewhat , gay rights activists disrupted the polish leader 's speech to protest what they called his " homophobic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors held up posters of the banned warsaw equality march the speech was delayed for about half an hour as dozens of protestors shouted " solidarity without exclusion , " a reference to the slogan of the labor movement that challenged poland 's stalinist regime in 1980s . " the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out . " the president provoked the wrath of polish gays when he banned a gay pride march in warsaw last year while still mayor of the capital . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaczynski : good polish-german relations important for europe polish president lech kaczynski said on wednesday that good relations with germany were " important for all of europe " after he met with german chancellor angela merkel on his first visit to berlin .

the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only thing they have their eye on is dividends , dividends , dividends , " said matthias wagner , of the dresden tenant 's association , in a spiegel online article . " sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians . " weighing the lesser of two evils still , the deal will likely go through , despite the 45,000 signatures affixed to a petition protesting it .

the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only thing they have their eye on is dividends , dividends , dividends , " said matthias wagner , of the dresden tenant 's association , in a spiegel online article . " sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians . " weighing the lesser of two evils still , the deal will likely go through , despite the 45,000 signatures affixed to a petition protesting it .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .
but citing the lagging interest in umts , analysts are skeptical .
" consumers are not looking for quicker versions of umts , but a good reason why they should even use umts , " said vincent ohana of the technology consulting group eurospace in an interview with television station ard . robbie williams , yes ; soccer , no analysts are just as skeptical about the number of people who will actually take advantage of the world cup offers by t-mobile and o2 . though 100,000 customers tuned in to watch a live broadcast of a robbie williams concert last fall , interest in soccer - which does n't play well on a small screen - could be limited . t-mobile is perhaps hoping analysis and highlight clips provided by german pay tv channel premiere , which currently holds the rights to german and european soccer , will sweeten the deal . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest high-tech fair opens in germany the world 's biggest high-tech fair , cebit , opens thursday , showcasing the latest in robotics , computers and consumer electronics to make gadget fans ' hearts beat faster .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .
bookworms will be able to run through a similar scanner and , with a chip in each volume , skip long check-out lines at the library . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doctors carry scanners in the future ?
and patients will eventually be able to have rfid chips implanted in their bodies , allowing any attending doctor to call up his or her personal health history at the touch of a button . " the cebit is focusing on rfid this year because in the future , all processing , for example in the field of logistics , will be changed beyond recognition , " raue said . the global market for rfid chips is expected to go through the roof in the coming years , with turnover likely to quadruple to 5.5 billion euros by 2008 , according to independent research firm idtechex . sea-change in telecommunications willi berchtold , the president of bitkom , which represents more than 1,000 german it , telecommunication and consumer electronics companies , told reporters that a sea-change in telecommunications was having a ripple effect throughout the industry , noting that land-line services - a 20-billion-euro industry in germany - were giving way to mobile and internet telephony . " mobile phone calls have become so cheap that many people are even using them at home , " he said , noting the price had dropped an average of 10 percent in the last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans are dropping land lines and just use their mobile phones meanwhile high-speed internet servicess via dsl or tv cable are skyrocketing , with the number of connections climbing 56 percent to 10.7 million . " in the future , the internet , telephony and television will converge , " he said .

but cebit would not be complete without a few rather gimmicky gee-whiz inventions including " intelligent " vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers that take care of household chores and return themselves to the charging station . the fair has seen the biggest growth among asian exhibitors , with china , hong kong and south korea all reporting a major jump in companies taking part . next year 's event cebit is expected to attract 1,700 exhibitors from the asian-pacific region - unmatched by any other trade fair in the world , including in asia , according to organizers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on germany 's most important trade fairs .

want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .
now france - and maybe germany - aims to develop a eurocentric alternative to the dominant internet search engine , google . checking a fact ?
planning a vacation ?
want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .

a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .

but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .

the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only thing they have their eye on is dividends , dividends , dividends , " said matthias wagner , of the dresden tenant 's association , in a spiegel online article . " sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .
" that is an artificial creation .

" there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation .

" the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .
but citing the lagging interest in umts , analysts are skeptical .
" consumers are not looking for quicker versions of umts , but a good reason why they should even use umts , " said vincent ohana of the technology consulting group eurospace in an interview with television station ard . robbie williams , yes ; soccer , no analysts are just as skeptical about the number of people who will actually take advantage of the world cup offers by t-mobile and o2 . though 100,000 customers tuned in to watch a live broadcast of a robbie williams concert last fall , interest in soccer - which does n't play well on a small screen - could be limited . t-mobile is perhaps hoping analysis and highlight clips provided by german pay tv channel premiere , which currently holds the rights to german and european soccer , will sweeten the deal . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest high-tech fair opens in germany the world 's biggest high-tech fair , cebit , opens thursday , showcasing the latest in robotics , computers and consumer electronics to make gadget fans ' hearts beat faster .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .
but citing the lagging interest in umts , analysts are skeptical .
" consumers are not looking for quicker versions of umts , but a good reason why they should even use umts , " said vincent ohana of the technology consulting group eurospace in an interview with television station ard . robbie williams , yes ; soccer , no analysts are just as skeptical about the number of people who will actually take advantage of the world cup offers by t-mobile and o2 . though 100,000 customers tuned in to watch a live broadcast of a robbie williams concert last fall , interest in soccer - which does n't play well on a small screen - could be limited . t-mobile is perhaps hoping analysis and highlight clips provided by german pay tv channel premiere , which currently holds the rights to german and european soccer , will sweeten the deal . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest high-tech fair opens in germany the world 's biggest high-tech fair , cebit , opens thursday , showcasing the latest in robotics , computers and consumer electronics to make gadget fans ' hearts beat faster .

forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .

" google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .
now france - and maybe germany - aims to develop a eurocentric alternative to the dominant internet search engine , google . checking a fact ?
planning a vacation ?
want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only thing they have their eye on is dividends , dividends , dividends , " said matthias wagner , of the dresden tenant 's association , in a spiegel online article . " sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians . " weighing the lesser of two evils still , the deal will likely go through , despite the 45,000 signatures affixed to a petition protesting it .
at the moment 40 of the council 's 70 members are in favor of the pact .
the pds party , the successor to the former east german communist party and the second-largest group in the council , is divided .
of the 17 members , only five are sure to vote against it . " the alternative would be reductions in the social and cultural sector , and who on the left wants that ? "

tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .
" that is an artificial creation . " the president was completing a two-day visit to germany on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish school children seem more excited about the eu than their president poland , with its 38.6 million inhabitants , is widely considered the most powerful of the newer members of the eu , which expanded to 25 states in 2004 when it allowed mostly eastern european nations into its ranks . but kaczynski , who was elected last year , said it was a myth to think that all europeans had a shared outlook . " there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation . "
the constitution was rejected by dutch and french voters in referendums last year . gay activists delay speech during a visit to berlin 's humboldt university , where kaczynski toned down his comments on the eu somewhat , gay rights activists disrupted the polish leader 's speech to protest what they called his " homophobic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors held up posters of the banned warsaw equality march the speech was delayed for about half an hour as dozens of protestors shouted " solidarity without exclusion , " a reference to the slogan of the labor movement that challenged poland 's stalinist regime in 1980s . " the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out . " the president provoked the wrath of polish gays when he banned a gay pride march in warsaw last year while still mayor of the capital . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaczynski : good polish-german relations important for europe polish president lech kaczynski said on wednesday that good relations with germany were " important for all of europe " after he met with german chancellor angela merkel on his first visit to berlin .

" cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .
bookworms will be able to run through a similar scanner and , with a chip in each volume , skip long check-out lines at the library . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doctors carry scanners in the future ?
and patients will eventually be able to have rfid chips implanted in their bodies , allowing any attending doctor to call up his or her personal health history at the touch of a button . " the cebit is focusing on rfid this year because in the future , all processing , for example in the field of logistics , will be changed beyond recognition , " raue said . the global market for rfid chips is expected to go through the roof in the coming years , with turnover likely to quadruple to 5.5 billion euros by 2008 , according to independent research firm idtechex . sea-change in telecommunications willi berchtold , the president of bitkom , which represents more than 1,000 german it , telecommunication and consumer electronics companies , told reporters that a sea-change in telecommunications was having a ripple effect throughout the industry , noting that land-line services - a 20-billion-euro industry in germany - were giving way to mobile and internet telephony . " mobile phone calls have become so cheap that many people are even using them at home , " he said , noting the price had dropped an average of 10 percent in the last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans are dropping land lines and just use their mobile phones meanwhile high-speed internet servicess via dsl or tv cable are skyrocketing , with the number of connections climbing 56 percent to 10.7 million . " in the future , the internet , telephony and television will converge , " he said .
" that is not a dream but the next step . " intelligent robots meanwhile germany 's renowned frauenhofer institute and the neurology clinic at berlin 's charite hospital are to unveil a " mental typewriter " that will allow people incapacitated by injury or disease to communicate . using 128 electrodes fastened to the cranium , the invention literally reads minds as the patient uses his thoughts to type out messages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will vacuum cleaners work on their own in the future ?
but cebit would not be complete without a few rather gimmicky gee-whiz inventions including " intelligent " vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers that take care of household chores and return themselves to the charging station . the fair has seen the biggest growth among asian exhibitors , with china , hong kong and south korea all reporting a major jump in companies taking part . next year 's event cebit is expected to attract 1,700 exhibitors from the asian-pacific region - unmatched by any other trade fair in the world , including in asia , according to organizers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on germany 's most important trade fairs .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .
but citing the lagging interest in umts , analysts are skeptical .
" consumers are not looking for quicker versions of umts , but a good reason why they should even use umts , " said vincent ohana of the technology consulting group eurospace in an interview with television station ard . robbie williams , yes ; soccer , no analysts are just as skeptical about the number of people who will actually take advantage of the world cup offers by t-mobile and o2 . though 100,000 customers tuned in to watch a live broadcast of a robbie williams concert last fall , interest in soccer - which does n't play well on a small screen - could be limited . t-mobile is perhaps hoping analysis and highlight clips provided by german pay tv channel premiere , which currently holds the rights to german and european soccer , will sweeten the deal . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's biggest high-tech fair opens in germany the world 's biggest high-tech fair , cebit , opens thursday , showcasing the latest in robotics , computers and consumer electronics to make gadget fans ' hearts beat faster .

some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .
now france - and maybe germany - aims to develop a eurocentric alternative to the dominant internet search engine , google . checking a fact ?
planning a vacation ?
want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

the buyer ?
a us investor .
tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also mulling such sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is also looking for buyers an investor 's dream , a tenant 's nightmare ? foreign investment companies , mostly from the united states , see the purchases as good investments .
they pay good money , promise to stay long and reduce vacancy rates by renovating old apartments into attractive property .
but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only thing they have their eye on is dividends , dividends , dividends , " said matthias wagner , of the dresden tenant 's association , in a spiegel online article . " sand in the eyes " of tenants fortress deutschland has tried to ease concerns , by signing a " social pact " that forces them to guarantee , among other things , no significant rent increases in the next decade , and lifelong residential guarantee to current tenants older than 60 . " we want to hold on to the property , the entire thing depends on the rent income , " said matthias moser .
he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians . " weighing the lesser of two evils still , the deal will likely go through , despite the 45,000 signatures affixed to a petition protesting it .
at the moment 40 of the council 's 70 members are in favor of the pact .
the pds party , the successor to the former east german communist party and the second-largest group in the council , is divided .
of the 17 members , only five are sure to vote against it . " the alternative would be reductions in the social and cultural sector , and who on the left wants that ? "

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .

germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .

" the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

the mobile division of the german telecoms giant announced it would broadcast 20 games for its customers .
but how many will tune in ? anyone looking for confirmation that the next generation of mobile phones has arrived need wait no longer than this summer 's world cup .
t-mobile , the mobile wing of the german telecoms company deutsche telekom , is planning to broadcast 20 matches of the four-week tournament .
mobile phone customers will pay 2 euros a day , or 7.50 euros per month for the package , which will also include programming from mtv .
british mobile provider o2 is planning a similar venture to coincide with the world cup , but with a smaller group of users .
coming on the heels of successes with asian mobile phone users , european companies are wondering if a world cup year will bring the breakthrough they have been waiting for .
ever since the establishment of umts networks across germany enabled users to do everything from downloading video clips to checking e-mail , telecoms companies have been trying in vain to get customers to purchase the extra services . who will watch it ? so far , they have n't had much success .
among 80 million mobile phone users in germany , only 2.3 million have phones capable of exploiting the various umts features - though nine million are expected this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile will broadcast 20 world cup games telecoms companies are plowing ahead optimistically anyway .
at this year 's cebit , the buzz is about a mobile system even faster than umts .
high speed downlink packet access , of hsdpa , allows users to play games online and watch films without digital hitches .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .

" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted .

forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek .

germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .

they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries .

" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .

google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .

quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 german music concert cancelled under pressure from right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing radicals are taking the fight to local municipality level the eastern german town of halberstadt buckled under pressure from the extreme right and called off a concert by konstantin wecker .
politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

" the president was completing a two-day visit to germany on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish school children seem more excited about the eu than their president poland , with its 38.6 million inhabitants , is widely considered the most powerful of the newer members of the eu , which expanded to 25 states in 2004 when it allowed mostly eastern european nations into its ranks . but kaczynski , who was elected last year , said it was a myth to think that all europeans had a shared outlook . " there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation . "
the constitution was rejected by dutch and french voters in referendums last year . gay activists delay speech during a visit to berlin 's humboldt university , where kaczynski toned down his comments on the eu somewhat , gay rights activists disrupted the polish leader 's speech to protest what they called his " homophobic policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors held up posters of the banned warsaw equality march the speech was delayed for about half an hour as dozens of protestors shouted " solidarity without exclusion , " a reference to the slogan of the labor movement that challenged poland 's stalinist regime in 1980s . " the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out . " the president provoked the wrath of polish gays when he banned a gay pride march in warsaw last year while still mayor of the capital . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaczynski : good polish-german relations important for europe polish president lech kaczynski said on wednesday that good relations with germany were " important for all of europe " after he met with german chancellor angela merkel on his first visit to berlin .

forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .

" google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .

they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .

" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats .

" combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .

" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats .

tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .

but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .

he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians .

tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .

but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .

if it goes through , it could be one of the biggest flotations in germany this year . against the backdrop of the international tourism fair in berlin -lrb- itb -rrb- , air berlin chairman joachim hunold unveiled his airline 's plans for going public . air berlin , which has expanded rapidly in the past 15 years to become germany 's second largest airline following lufthansa , looks to the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- for a fresh cash injection for continued expansion plans . " if we want to continue to grow and expand in the highly competitive european market , we must respond appropriately by going public , " hunold said at a press conference at the itb in berlin on wednesday . biggest growth story of the year although the airline has yet to announce a timeframe for the flotation and hunold has declined to say how big the initial offering will be , experts forecast a start date in the second quarter of 2006 .
sources close to the company have also said the ipo could be worth " at least 500 million euros -lrb- $ 595 million -rrb- . " recent press reports have suggested that the ipo could raise up to 700 million euros , making it one of the biggest flotations on the german stock exchange this year .

in the upcoming year it plans to purchase six new airplanes and expand its offerings . the company employs around 2,700 workers and is looking to hire another 600 in the near future . air berlin 's growth over the last 15 years is primarily due to the vision of joachim hunold , who developed the budget airline from a small venture to a major german player .

germanwings would function as a delivery airline , bringing passengers to condor 's long-distance hubs . in the past year , the number of passengers flying with germanwings skyrocketed by 57 percent to 5.5 million .
a further 36 percent increase in passengers is expected for this year .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .
bookworms will be able to run through a similar scanner and , with a chip in each volume , skip long check-out lines at the library . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doctors carry scanners in the future ?
and patients will eventually be able to have rfid chips implanted in their bodies , allowing any attending doctor to call up his or her personal health history at the touch of a button . " the cebit is focusing on rfid this year because in the future , all processing , for example in the field of logistics , will be changed beyond recognition , " raue said . the global market for rfid chips is expected to go through the roof in the coming years , with turnover likely to quadruple to 5.5 billion euros by 2008 , according to independent research firm idtechex . sea-change in telecommunications willi berchtold , the president of bitkom , which represents more than 1,000 german it , telecommunication and consumer electronics companies , told reporters that a sea-change in telecommunications was having a ripple effect throughout the industry , noting that land-line services - a 20-billion-euro industry in germany - were giving way to mobile and internet telephony . " mobile phone calls have become so cheap that many people are even using them at home , " he said , noting the price had dropped an average of 10 percent in the last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans are dropping land lines and just use their mobile phones meanwhile high-speed internet servicess via dsl or tv cable are skyrocketing , with the number of connections climbing 56 percent to 10.7 million . " in the future , the internet , telephony and television will converge , " he said .
" that is not a dream but the next step . " intelligent robots meanwhile germany 's renowned frauenhofer institute and the neurology clinic at berlin 's charite hospital are to unveil a " mental typewriter " that will allow people incapacitated by injury or disease to communicate . using 128 electrodes fastened to the cranium , the invention literally reads minds as the patient uses his thoughts to type out messages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will vacuum cleaners work on their own in the future ?
but cebit would not be complete without a few rather gimmicky gee-whiz inventions including " intelligent " vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers that take care of household chores and return themselves to the charging station . the fair has seen the biggest growth among asian exhibitors , with china , hong kong and south korea all reporting a major jump in companies taking part . next year 's event cebit is expected to attract 1,700 exhibitors from the asian-pacific region - unmatched by any other trade fair in the world , including in asia , according to organizers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on germany 's most important trade fairs .

want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-
germany 's only link to quaero at present is an agreement between a german meta-search engine , metager.de , and exalead .
but several technology and information companies are considering the project .
they include siemens , bertelsmann , and public broadcaster ard -lrb- which deutsche welle and this web site are part of -rrb- . follow the money whether or not europe can still catch the information-society boat is uncertain , according to sander beuermann .
but it is critical that europe try : " access to the online economy , and being part of the whole information society " is at stake , he said . for one thing , a single-access source for internet information is overly susceptible to market forces , activists argue .
since the advent of google , a booming business has sprung up in search-engine optimizing companies , whose sole job is to help manipulate google 's algorithms and push their clients ' web sites up the google rankings . " it is helpful to the search-engine optimizing companies that there is only one search engine that has to be cheated , " sander-beuermann said . while a typical google search might turn up dozens of pages of information ranked by relevance , statistics show only 15 percent of users ever look beyond the first page - indeed , beyond the first few entries . " if you want your opinion to land in the google top 10 , i am very sure that with enough money , you can buy your way into the top 10 , " sander-beuermann said . and if you add the word ' helen ' ? hendrik speck is a lecturer in computer science at the university of kaiserslautern , and is a strong quaero activist .
he seconds sander-beuermann ’ s concerns , and cites the example of searching for the keyword " troy " on google . " we all know that keyword has a rich cultural history .
but at google , most of the first results are a description of a second-class hollywood production featuring a third-rate actor , " speck said , referring to the movie starring brad pitt . that example may be funny " until you realize how important the internet has become as an information source among young people , " speck argued .
" my -lrb- college -rrb- students don ’ t subscribe to newspapers or magazines , and even tv consumption is down .
the trend in everything is down except online or rich text media . " worst-case scenario sander-beuermann also sees a sinister threat in google ’ s increasing scope of services .
" it is branching out from being a search engine into all online business , " he noted .
" there is google mail , google print , google wallet -lrb- an online payment service -rrb- … the next step is for google to buy a bank like visa , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google headquarters in mountain view , california for sander-beuermann , the worst-case scenario would be if microsoft were to buy google - a rumor that runs through wall street on occasion - creating an ominipotent information megalith . yet if the idea of information-access being at the mercy of market forces is worrisome , quaero activist speck says privacy is the issue of real geopolitical concern .
" the cartel of google , msn , and yahoo constitutes de facto a national security risk for all european countries , " said speck . privacy issues " the current market leaders are not based within europe ; they can compile huge databases and profiles about european users , and these data centers do not necessarily fulfill strict european privacy protection laws .
and they participate in censorship efforts and they even cooperate with authoritarian regimes , " he said . speck sees a dire need for an awareness campaign on the issue .
google has a huge de facto monopoly , " and nobody cares , " he said . " “ compare it to the rest of the german media scene , where a tv station with 20 percent of the market has a tough time with the federal cartel commission . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has innumerable partnerships - in this case , with aol activists acknowledge that any government-funded search engine would come with its own limitations - censorship could be an issue , for example .
but speck heartily endorses quaero as the development of a specifically european competitor to google . ' european values ' at stake " with quaero … europe can develop alternative technologies that do not only take the commercial interests of a few american companies into consideration .
quaero has the potential to represent european values and norms , provide transparent search engine results and technologies , and protect the privacy of european citizens , " he said . it is not yet clear how much european investors will ultimately be willing to spend , but their quest to build a rival to google is likely to be very costly .
google spent $ 7.5 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- on one lab with 10 student in its development stages , " which is more than some of our universities have over here , " speck said . meanwhile , the us search engine behemoth continues to spend $ 400 million annually on research and development . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

some europeans are concerned about us hegemony in the worldwide information market .
now france - and maybe germany - aims to develop a eurocentric alternative to the dominant internet search engine , google . checking a fact ?
planning a vacation ?
want information on an illness , a restaurant , a historical event , pet care ?
forget all those dusty reference books and do what nearly everyone with an internet connection does : google it . the internet has become the place where much of modern society turns for answers to life 's questions , both large and small .
with around 85 percent of the search-engine market , including that of germany , google has become the modern version of the delphic oracle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yahoo is a google competitor - but still has a small market share in comparison to an everyday user , the fact that there is one main method of sifting internet information may seem like no big deal .
and few people doing a search on google or one of its competitors -lrb- yahoo , msn , and alta vista make up most of the remaining 10 percent of the market -rrb- give much thought to the fact that they are using the services of a for-profit us company . france , germany involved but for wolfgang sander-beuermann , head of the search-engine research lab at the university of hanover and part of a growing cadre of european google-skeptics , the situation is downright dangerous . " google is on the way to becoming the most global media power that ever existed on earth , and the potential for misusing it is so enormous it can not be accepted , " said sander-beuermann , who also founded the nonprofit association for the promotion of search engine technology and free access to knowledge -lrb- suma -rrb- . another man on the case is french president jacques chirac , who is pushing an initiative for france , together with germany and perhaps other eu nations , to develop a european search engine to compete with the american behemoth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google agreed to censor its internet searches in china , and the us saw protest demonstrations " we must take up the challenge presented by american giants like google and yahoo .
there is a the threat that tomorrow , what is not available online will be invisible to the world , " chirac said in a presidential address to the nation at new year 's . his project , spurred by the french government and headed by an internet information company called exalead.com , runs under the name quaero -lrb- latin for " i seek . " -rrb-

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats .

" combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .

the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .

" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.03.2006 government unveils plans to keep seniors working longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping germans employed longer is a government goal germany 's labor minister launches package of incentives aimed at helping older workers remain on the job longer .
it comes as a response to criticism of the government 's plan to raise the retirement age to 67 . only one in three germans works until the official retirement age of 65 ; only 42 percent of germans older than 55 are still gainfully employed .
labor experts say those statistics are unlikely to change as long as five million people are jobless .
but labor minister franz müntefering claims his package of incentives for elderly workers would help turn the situation around . dubbed " 50 plus , " münterfering 's plan aims to help older workers remain part of the workforce longer .
it includes state bonuses to support elderly workers in low-wage jobs and financial incentives for employers willing to hire people over 50 . the proposal comes in response to criticism of the government 's decision to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 years in a staggered process ending in 2029 .
critics have pointed out that lifting the age limit is unrealistic in a country where so few older people stay on the job much beyond the age of 60 . germans retire on average at just over 61 years of age .
that is considerably lower than the average american who works until 65 and the average japanese who is on the job until 69 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens surfing the internet demographic forecasts indicate germany 's population is greying rapidly , with the age increase accompanied by a decrease in the number of working people who pay into social security .
that is making it difficult for the state 's pension system to cover growing retirement costs .
in the view of müntefering and his colleagues in the governing coalition of social democrats and the christian union bloc , getting more people to work longer seemed like the right idea . skeptical view from the street in interviews on several berlin streets , the minister 's ideas got a mixed response . " i 'm approaching the age where i should start thinking about this issue , " said a woman in berlin .
" i believe müntefering 's plans are n't so bad .
the help will be especially important for elderly people who 've been unemployed for a long time .
i imagine that they now have only a slim chance of being reintegrated in the job market . " others over 50 complain that past measures designed to help elder workers find jobs have had limited success . " it could probably be an effective instrument , but only if they really put into practice what they 're promising , " said a female cleaner .
" there simply has n't been enough willingness to see to it that such measures really have the desired effect . " " i 'm over 50 , " she added , " and whenever i apply for a better-paid job , employers look at me in disbelief and tell me that for me the job market is closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans work on average until age 61 her skepticism is widely shared .
many blame employers for being unwilling to hire older workers .
others argue that the tendency towards a quick-fix in the form of financial incentives is not well thought out . " there 's a widespread misconception that 's also shared by the labor minister that you only need to grant a few financial incentives and then all of a sudden the unemployment problem will vanish into thin air , " explained a berlin man . no clear solution in sight while many agree that germans should be encouraged and enabled to work longer , there is no clear solution of the best way to achieve this .
while incentives for employers are one possibility , others suggest capping incentives on taking early retirement , which would make leaving the workforce early less attractive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat and labor minister franz müntefering müntefering himself has admitted that there is no single easy solution .
what 's clear , he said on wednesday , is that the current retirement system will not be sufficient to cover the needs of all those leaving the workforce .
on the one hand , germans must be willing to work longer and employers must do their part in keeping and hiring elderly workers . on the other hand , he said , individuals must also start taking responsibility for their own futures and depend less on state pension plans .
according to government statistics , the current pension system will not be sufficient to cover all living costs in 2019 .
germans must therefore be prepared to provide at least partially for their own retirement , the minister said . in addressing criticism , müntefering responded that there was plenty germans could do to cover costs in retirement , if they did n't want to work any longer : " one can try lots of things like playing the balalaika or lottery .

tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good times for ingolf rossberg a model to follow ? across germany , other mayors will be following the sale closely .
poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations .
whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .
" dresden will soon be germany 's first debt-free big city , " said peter götz , expert for city politics in the german bundestag for the christian democrats .
" this is a good example of sustainable local politics . " berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .

but they also have an eye on annual dividends of between 7.5 and 8 percent and the reit , a tax loophole that eliminates corporate income tax . the latter is what has led critics to doubt their good intentions , some even going so far as to label them capitalist " locusts " hungry for a quick rate of return .
the national tenants ' association sees the sale of low-income housing as nothing less than the elimination of one of the columns of the social welfare state .
they predict an increase of 4 percent annually in rents , and criticize the " improvements " promised by the investors - like balconies and double-paned windows - as superfluous .

he added that fortress also wanted to reduce vacancy rates , currently at 18 percent . but the national tenant 's association has labeled the pact " sand in the eyes of tenants and local politicians .

tenants are concerned . by the end of thursday , ingolf rossberg will likely have accomplished in one day what german big city mayors have tried unsuccessfully for years to do : eliminate his city 's debt . the dresden city council will vote thursday on whether to sell the city 's entire residential real estate holdings - around 48,000 apartments - to us investor fortress deutschland .
the sale would bring the city 981 million euros -lrb- $ 1.17 million -rrb- , more than enough to eliminate the 740 million euros of debt the east german city has accrued .

poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled german big towns with mountains of debt - berlin alone is close to 30 billion euros in the hole .

whether dresden goes ahead with the highly controversial strategy could set the tone for other german big cities .

" my opinion of the eu is the following : a super state which polarizes countries ' areas of competence but which at the same time is rather helpless because it only has a symbolic budget , " kaczynski told the daily die welt .
" that is an artificial creation .

" there is no european public opinion , rather national public opinions , " he said . as for the eu constitution , which was designed to provide the framework for the enlarged bloc , kaczynski said it was " very open to interpretation .

the constitution was rejected by dutch and french voters in referendums last year . gay activists delay speech during a visit to berlin 's humboldt university , where kaczynski toned down his comments on the eu somewhat , gay rights activists disrupted the polish leader 's speech to protest what they called his " homophobic policies .

" the polish president is known for his hostile political stance towards gays and lesbians , " the editor of a berlin gay magazine , holger wicht , said as he approached kaczynski .
" he is an anti-democrat . " when the noise died down , kaczynski responded by saying he would not persecute gays but did not believe homosexuality should be encouraged because gays did not have children . " i do not plan to persecute homosexuals or to hinder their careers , " he said .
" but there is no reason to encourage it because it would mean that mankind would slowly die out .

" with coherent policies , we will create better conditions for the research and innovation process , " she said . merkel said she also planned a " national it summit " at which the public and private sectors would look at where the government could foster growth in the sector . " but i tell you quite openly , not only the government but industry as well must intensify its efforts in this area to ensure germany is fit for the future , " she said , noting that business contributed two-thirds of the national research and development budget . booming industry the cebit , running march 9-15 , will this year host more than 6,200 exhibitors from 71 countries and some 474,000 visitors eager to take in new advances in digital and information technology . now celebrating its 20th anniversary , the fair has recovered its stride after a difficult five years marked by uncertainty in the sector after the burst of the internet bubble . the ripple effect throughout the hardware , software and telecommunications industries is only beginning to smooth out , but a new optimism is catching hold as new gizmos to capture consumers ' imaginations prepare to hit the market . " cebit shows how digital solutions for work and leisure are now rapidly converging - from software and electronic devices for business , via communications solutions for home and office , to the complete ' digital lifestyle ' , " said ernst raue of the event 's organizing team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flat screen tvs are expected to sell well ahead of the world cup this summer turnover in the electronics and telecommunications industries in the european union is expected to increase 3.2 percent to 643 billion euros -lrb- $ 772 billion -rrb- this year and another 3 percent in 2007 , according to the european information technology observatory . " our sector is again growing faster this year in the eu than the economy as a whole , " vice president of the german industry group bitkom , heinz-paul bonn , said . among the most eagerly awaited trends are new applications for radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- technology , which is slated to wipe the traditional bar code off the map . developers see hundreds of uses for the tiny antennae planted in chips the size of a postage stamp .
shoppers in future will be able to pull their carts up to the supermarket counter and with one " beep ! " have all the products registered and billed in an instant .
bookworms will be able to run through a similar scanner and , with a chip in each volume , skip long check-out lines at the library . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doctors carry scanners in the future ?
and patients will eventually be able to have rfid chips implanted in their bodies , allowing any attending doctor to call up his or her personal health history at the touch of a button . " the cebit is focusing on rfid this year because in the future , all processing , for example in the field of logistics , will be changed beyond recognition , " raue said . the global market for rfid chips is expected to go through the roof in the coming years , with turnover likely to quadruple to 5.5 billion euros by 2008 , according to independent research firm idtechex . sea-change in telecommunications willi berchtold , the president of bitkom , which represents more than 1,000 german it , telecommunication and consumer electronics companies , told reporters that a sea-change in telecommunications was having a ripple effect throughout the industry , noting that land-line services - a 20-billion-euro industry in germany - were giving way to mobile and internet telephony . " mobile phone calls have become so cheap that many people are even using them at home , " he said , noting the price had dropped an average of 10 percent in the last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans are dropping land lines and just use their mobile phones meanwhile high-speed internet servicess via dsl or tv cable are skyrocketing , with the number of connections climbing 56 percent to 10.7 million . " in the future , the internet , telephony and television will converge , " he said .
" that is not a dream but the next step . " intelligent robots meanwhile germany 's renowned frauenhofer institute and the neurology clinic at berlin 's charite hospital are to unveil a " mental typewriter " that will allow people incapacitated by injury or disease to communicate . using 128 electrodes fastened to the cranium , the invention literally reads minds as the patient uses his thoughts to type out messages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will vacuum cleaners work on their own in the future ?
but cebit would not be complete without a few rather gimmicky gee-whiz inventions including " intelligent " vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers that take care of household chores and return themselves to the charging station . the fair has seen the biggest growth among asian exhibitors , with china , hong kong and south korea all reporting a major jump in companies taking part . next year 's event cebit is expected to attract 1,700 exhibitors from the asian-pacific region - unmatched by any other trade fair in the world , including in asia , according to organizers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on germany 's most important trade fairs .

politicians have expressed dismay over the influence of neo-nazis in the former east . a concert planned for march 8 in the former eastern german border town of halberstadt was cancelled at the last minute after the right-wing national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- applied pressure to local authorities .
the extremist party had claimed the event scheduled for performance in a school and held under the motto " nazis get out of our town " was in fact an unacceptable form of political campaigning for left-wing parties ahead of state elections on march 26 . the npd threatened to buy up all the tickets and turn out in large numbers at the concert orchestrated by political songwriter konstantin wecker if local authorities refused to call it off .
they had begun mobilizing forces in other eastern german cities to protest the concert and what they regarded as a clear state-sponsored preference for leftist parties . fearing a major conflict with neo-nazis descending upon halberstadt , deputy county commissioner hans-dieter sturm decided to cancel wednesday 's performance .
he justified the decision by saying that if the concert had taken place , there would be little room for preventing a similar performance by right-wing extremists in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konstantin wecker has never been one to shy away from political topics the 59-year-old songwriter appeared instead in front of 300 fans in the nearby town of jena .
he vowed to return to halberstadt in the summer for an open air concert .
" one should n't give in to the npd , that would be disappointing , " he told the online edition of news magazine der spiegel .
" i have n't given up on halberstadt . " politicians criticize local authorities klaus jeziorsky , interior minister for the state of saxony-anhalt , where halberstadt is located , said buckling in under pressure from the npd was in no way justifiable .
" one can not give in to threats by right-wing extremists , " he said on thursday . for niels annen , the head of a social democratic project against right-wing extremism , the cancellation of the concert was a two-fold scandal .
" on the one hand , the npd has publicly threatened a democratic group with violence and on the other hand , they were successful and got what they wanted . " this sends the completely wrong message and in a sense confirms the npd 's strategy to create so-called " fear zones " where the extreme right wields influence , annen told the german news program tagesschau . the head of the greens ' parliamentary fraction , volker beck , criticized the town 's decision and said " the nazis should not be given any social space and by no means should we give in to their threats . " the central council for jews in germany called the decision by halberstadt authorities a " politically bankrupt . " combating right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the npd during a demonstration of neo-nazis in schwerin , northeastern germany but halberstadt is not unique .
observers of the right-wing scene in germany have noticed an increase in activity recently , especially in terms of gaining influence through threats of violence .
ulla jelpke , spokeswoman for interior affairs in the left party , told tagesschau that such events as in halberstadt " unfortunately are becoming more common . " she criticized the federal government for not doing enough to prevent the spread of right-wing radicalism , saying the federal parliament needs to address right-wing activity as a serious threat in germany . both the social democrats and the greens have presented proposals for fighting right-wing extremism and racial hatred .
it 's up to the government now to finance the projects .
" we need to continue with our work , and we are discussing the topic in depth with the christian democratic union , " annen said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police carry out major raids of skinhead group in germany police across germany staged raids against the outlawed skinhead group blood and honor and identified several suspects believed to be managing its activities underground .

the american journal of clinical nutrition study contradicts previous research which suggested breastfeeding could protect against later obesity .
it measured the body fatness of 313 american children aged five and found no difference between those who were breastfed and those who were not .
but this should not diminish the many benefits of breastfeeding , it added .
lead researcher dr hillary burdette at the children 's hospital of philadelphia said there was much interest in whether breastfeeding or the delayed introduction of complementary foods or both can reduce the risk of obesity later . "
previous research has suggested that breast-fed babies may be better able to regulate their energy intakes over formula-fed babies " ursula arens british dietetic association but she said many studies had conflicting results , so the team tried to devise a new technique to measure their subjects ' body fatness , or adiposity , using a specially created x-ray machine .
earlier studies had used a body mass index , which divides a person 's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres .
the children were enrolled in the study at the age of three , and their mothers reported information about feeding practices about the first year of life .
the mothers were also asked when their children started eating infant cereal , baby food , mashed and regular table food and sweetened beverages such as fizzy drinks and fruit juice .
when the children reached an average of five years old they had their body fat measured using the x-ray machine .
caution the results were then adjusted for factors which may have influenced the child 's body fat including maternal obesity , socio-economic status and maternal smoking .
the study found : " regardless of the duration of breastfeeding , breastfed children did not have significantly less fat mass than did children who were never breast fed .
" when fat mass was compared between groups of children who had different combinations of breastfeeding and formula feeding and children who were never breastfed , the differences were not significant . "
the team said it was possible that some of the protective effects of breastfeeding against later obesity were " overestimated " when bmi was used as a measure .
energy intake it concluded : " clinicians should be cautious about concluding that breastfeeding protects against later obesity solely on the basis of studies using bmi .
" this in no way , however , diminishes the importance of recommending breastfeeding for its multiple and other benefits to mother and child . "
ursula arens , spokeswoman for the british dietetic association , said the method the researchers used for measuring body fat was more accurate than methods just based on weighing .
" previous research has suggested that breast-fed babies may be better able to regulate their energy intakes over formula-fed babies , but the outcome of this study does not support this view .
" it does not challenge the many positive health effects for mother and child , of breast-feeing , but ' obesity prevention ' , at least up to age five , does not seem to be a benefit that can now be promoted .
she added : " there have been many developments in the formulation of infant milk , and the products on the market today better match breast-milk features than previous products . "

powys is believed to be the uk 's last non-political local authority , but last week labour councillors said they intended to form a group .
however , they changed their minds after some party members raised doubts .
these problems have now been resolved and labour has declared its intention to alter powys ' political landscape .
on monday , the party 's leader on the council , sandra davies , said although some members had expressed doubts she remained committed to the group system .
since 1974 , councillors ' independence in powys has meant they have not had to toe a party line when voting .
on their heads be it if they spoil this cohesive , friendly , responsive council councillor gareth morgan some council members claim this non-confrontational approach has made for transparent debate and clarity , and is the envy of other local authorities .
liberal democrat gareth morgan , who sits on the council 's ruling board and is opposed to political groups , said he found the labour councillors ' decision " illogical " .
" the question is , have they -lrb- labour councillors -rrb- been coerced from the outside to take this step , " he added .

he added : " on their heads be it if they spoil this cohesive , friendly , responsive council .

in response , labour councillor gwyn gwillim said labour rules meant they had to form a group .
he added : " it 's not the case that we 've been coerced to take this step , but we are the only labour councillors in the uk who are not part of a group .
labour party rules say we have to form a group . "
labour 's declaration could prompt the liberal democrats to form their own band of up to 24 members , but it is unclear if the independents , conservatives or plaid cymru will also form groups .

"
we have decided that scotland should aspire to generate 40 % of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 " three years ago , scotland 's environment minister ross finnie announced an ambitious new target for electricity generation in scotland .
he had previously stated that 18 % of electricity would be generated from wind , wave , hydro , biomass and landfill gas by 2010 .
the addition of wind farms to existing hydro projects has pushed the scottish executive well on the way to the first target .
as scotland 's nuclear and coal-fired power stations reach the end of their life , will renewables be able to plug the gap in 14 years ' time ?
deputy minister for enterprise allan wilson we are confident that through a mix of energy sources and improved energy efficiency , we will resolve any potential energy gap in the future .
an energy review at uk level is currently looking at the best way this can be done .
the intention to extend the life of both longannet and hunterston b will be a significant boost to scotland 's energy capacity and increasing numbers of wind and hydro projects are coming on stream .
scotland also has the potential to be a world leader in marine energy and i look forward to seeing how wave and tidal projects develop in the future .
snp energy spokesman richard lochhead the snp supports policies that will turn scotland into a renewables powerhouse and a centre of excellence for clean technologies .
scotland is an energy rich nation that can not only be self-sufficient in secure and clean energy but can gain enormous economic and environmental benefits .
there is no need for new nuclear power stations in scotland .
they are unwanted given that nuclear is dangerous , dirty and expensive .
and new nuclear stations are not needed to meet our energy needs .
over and above emerging technologies such as solar , biomass and tidal energy , we can now use our massive gas and coal reserves cleanly .
it is very exciting to see new developments in the pipeline such as the proposal for a hydrogen power station in peterhead producing carbon free electricity , an offshore windfarm in the moray firth and the life-extension of longannet , scotland 's electricity workhorse , with the installation of clean technologies .
to make this vision a reality , the scottish parliament needs the energy powers to ensure energy rich scotland is able to reap the full benefits of our potential to eliminate fuel poverty and reap the economic and environmental benefits .
scottish tory energy spokesman alex johnstone we envisage a diverse mix of energy production to best answer scotland 's future energy needs - and a balanced energy policy means that no one existing or potential resource should be ignored .
however , the concerns of climate change and co2 emissions mean that some modifications will have to be made .
that could include increasing our reliance on emission-free nuclear or changing the technology to deal with resources , such as clean coal .
renewables must also play their part .
however , with the current restrictions they pose due to intermittency and their impact on the environment , we suspect that at present this will only be in a limited , supportive role .
but perhaps if the scottish executive and the uk government revisited their renewable energy policy , this would change .
firstly , by providing proper planning guidance on the siting of wind farms for local authorities , communities and developers .
secondly , by reviewing the renewables obligation certificate -lrb- roc -rrb- system , to encourage entrepreneurs to develop the next generation of renewable energy providers that will provide reliable and constant emission-free energy , like wave and tidal power , and energy from biomass and fuel cells technology .
green msp chris ballance the scottish green party wants to see greatly increased use of renewable energy in scotland .
it is vital that we move towards a low carbon and nuclear-free economy to tackle climate change and pollution .
the full range of renewable power sources should be used .
wave and tidal power , biomass , hydro , onshore and offshore wind , solar , geothermal heat , combined heat and power and microrenewable energy - all these and more , aided by reduced energy use through energy efficiency measures - can easily provide for scotland 's needs .
the scottish executive needs to provide many more incentives to these industries so that scotland can also gain thousands of jobs and clean economic development .
nuclear power is an unsustainable , uneconomic technology from the past that is not wanted and not needed .
a bright future lies ahead in renewable energy and energy efficiency if only the political will was there to do it properly .

we have decided that scotland should aspire to generate 40 % of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 three years ago , scotland 's environment minister ross finnie announced an ambitious new target for electricity generation in scotland .
he had previously stated that 18 % of electricity would be generated from wind , wave , hydro , biomass and landfill gas by 2010 .
the addition of wind farms to existing hydro projects has pushed the scottish executive well on the way to the first target .
as scotland 's nuclear and coal-fired power stations reach the end of their life , will renewables be able to plug the gap in 14 years ' time ?

the pair have written the script , based on a cult comic , bringing in close collaborator james mcteigue , who worked with them on their matrix films , to direct .
the wachowski brothers are film-makers who have managed to remain firmly behind the camera , making of a point of not promoting their films .
it is left to v for vendetta star natalie portman to promote the movie , helped along nicely by her dramatic appearance at the cannes festival sporting a shaved head .
it would not be right to call them reclusive but the tight grip on their personal life , limited photo calls and interviews have added to the mystique surrounding them .
their perceived shyness is in sharp contrast to other blockbuster directors such as steven spielberg , peter jackson and george lucas who generally embrace the promotion of their latest projects , building up their own media personalities .
filmography assassins - screenwriters bound - writers / directors the matrix - writers / directors the matrix reloaded - writers / directors the matrix revolutions - writers / directors v for vendetta - screenwriters at the world premiere of the long-awaited matrix sequel - matrix reloaded - the wachowskis slipped past banks of photographers largely unnoticed .
according to reports , the wachowski brothers stipulated in their contract for the matrix sequels that they would not have to do press interviews of any kind and that they would not have to be photographed for promotional purposes .
the two film-makers have said that they want their films to speak for themselves .
comic writers born in chicago to a businessman father and a mother who was a nurse and a painter , the pair were obsessed with the notions of perception and reality from an early age .
natalie portman 's shorn hair put the spotlight on v for vendetta larry attended bard college for two years before dropping out , and joining his brother - who had also dropped out of college - to work as a painter and carpenter .
both continued to write and take in a steady diet of comic books , as well as engage in philosophical debates .
the pair were apparently inspired by a book about legendary filmmaker roger corman to produce their own screenplay .
the result was reportedly a " corman-style yarn concerning cannibalism of the upper classes " , which failed to find a buyer in hollywood .
but the brothers received positive comments about its originality and the pair were inspired enough to keep going .
their second screenplay was accepted and the script would eventually become 1995 's assassins , starring sylvester stallone and antonio banderas .
the brothers took more creative control over their next project , writing and directing the thriller bound , a " lesbian heist " movie , which has since become a cult hit .
for their next film , the two brothers weaved their two main interests into a single thread , mixing philosophy and martial arts in the high-concept action movie the matrix .
they took the script to producer joel silver , who had worked on assassins with the pair , and he gave the green light to the film .
personal project he secured a $ 63m budget for a film directed by two relative newcomers , starring largely unproven actors and with an obscure plot .
such was its success that it became a multi-million dollar franchise , spawning two sequels as well as computer games and merchandise .
the wachowskis took on v for vendetta as their next project , drawing on their love of comic books to write the script .
the story first appeared in warrior comic in the early 1980s , which folded before the plot was completed .
nearly 10 years later , creators alan moore and david lloyd were able to complete the story in the form of a graphic novel and another 15 years later the wachowskis have brought it to the big screen .
but the film has been hit with negative comments after moore said he wanted to diassociate himself from the film .
and as their script for the dark thriller comes under close scrutiny , interest in what makes the wachowski brothers tick only heightens .
