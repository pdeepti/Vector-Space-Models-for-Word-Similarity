there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .

" the adhesion negotiation with turkey should take place without any preconceived objective , " merkel said . turkey 's potential membership is a divisive issue within the 25-member block , and some countries are deeply skeptical about admitting the large and populous muslim state .

" last month , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany would focus on creating a timetable to revive the european constitution , which french and dutch voters rejected by last summer .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions .

" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way .

the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and an afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years in deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said . " recently there was no security incidents in those areas , " bashary said .
" i do n't know what happened this time ... we are working on that . " bildunterschrift : steinmeier calls for justice german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the journalists ' deaths . " this heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice , " he said while expressing his condolences to the victims ' families , friends and colleagues . deutsche welle director general erik bettermann also gave his condolences to fischer and struwe 's families and praised their work in the middle east . " karen fischer and christian struwe did ground-breaking work to reconstruct a functioning media apparatus in afghanistan , " he said .
" it is tragic that karen fischer and christian struwe had to die in the country that they have personally supported over the past years . " pair had worked with isaf troops in berlin , the defense ministry said the two had not been under german military protection at the time of their death . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , however , said it had been informed of the killings . " the journalists , at the time , were not part of any engagements with isaf forces and were operating independently , " isaf spokesman major dominic white said in kabul , adding that the pair had been working in cooperation with isaf until wednesday .
" we do n't know the circumstances of their death . " taliban denies targeting journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after the us-led war in afghanistan , much of the country remains unsafe taliban leaders denied any involvement in fischer and struwe 's deaths . " our mujahedeen do not attack journalists , " taliban spokesperson kari yussuf ahmadi told the dpa news agency .
" that is not our goal .
we only attack americans and their supporters . " bamiyan , the journalists ' reported destination , is the site of the ancient statues of the buddha that were blown up by the taliban regime in march 2001 , months before the us-led invasion that started oct .
7 and brought down the fundamentalist government . fischer and struwe 's bodies were discovered saturday and brought to the provincial capital pul-i-khumri where officials found passes identifying them as journalists , according to provincial governor said ekramuddin massumie .
he added that the pair 's car , cameras and other equipment had not been stolen . afghanistan 's north calmer than the south baghlan is relatively calm and has seen little of the taliban-linked violence that is plaguing southern and eastern afghanistan although unrest has increased there this year . unknown gunmen killed a canadian carpenter in baghlan in july .
mike frastacky , 56 , had been working for four years to build a school in the area .
the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and an afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years in deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .
she traveled to the area a number of times for deutsche welle , filing reports on a number of issues including the afghan elections . christian struwe helped set up and train journalists for radio television afghanistan 's international news department , a public project supported by the deutsche welle .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states was held and questioned at a us air force facility in germany . two other guantanamo prisoners are also reported by reprieve to have said they were aware of terror suspects who were interrogated in prisons in germany . politicians call for additional inquiry politicians in germany reacted cautiously , calling for further investigation of the allegations . " in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.10.2006 female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female imam can better reach muslim women , argue some turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .

" in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions .

" we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast , which outlined german priorities as rotating president of the eu in 2007 . those priorities are expected to be discussed wednesday in berlin , during a meeting between the german government and european commission president jose manuel barroso . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pressed his case for eu accession during her six months as eu president merkel said germany would try to " make europe closer to its citizens , " by attempting to answer the " skeptical questions " europeans are asking themselves about the union .

can europe protect our security ?
are we not out of our depth , because we ca n't clearly establish our borders ? " the german chancellor asked , citing several such questions she want to answer . eu borders need definition she also urged europe to delineate its borders , and called for open discussions with turkey . " the adhesion negotiation with turkey should take place without any preconceived objective , " merkel said . turkey 's potential membership is a divisive issue within the 25-member block , and some countries are deeply skeptical about admitting the large and populous muslim state .

" last month , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany would focus on creating a timetable to revive the european constitution , which french and dutch voters rejected by last summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states was held and questioned at a us air force facility in germany . two other guantanamo prisoners are also reported by reprieve to have said they were aware of terror suspects who were interrogated in prisons in germany . politicians call for additional inquiry politicians in germany reacted cautiously , calling for further investigation of the allegations . " in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .

" we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast , which outlined german priorities as rotating president of the eu in 2007 . those priorities are expected to be discussed wednesday in berlin , during a meeting between the german government and european commission president jose manuel barroso . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pressed his case for eu accession during her six months as eu president merkel said germany would try to " make europe closer to its citizens , " by attempting to answer the " skeptical questions " europeans are asking themselves about the union . " is n't there too much bureaucracy ?
can europe protect our security ?
are we not out of our depth , because we ca n't clearly establish our borders ? " the german chancellor asked , citing several such questions she want to answer . eu borders need definition she also urged europe to delineate its borders , and called for open discussions with turkey . " the adhesion negotiation with turkey should take place without any preconceived objective , " merkel said . turkey 's potential membership is a divisive issue within the 25-member block , and some countries are deeply skeptical about admitting the large and populous muslim state .

" we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast , which outlined german priorities as rotating president of the eu in 2007 . those priorities are expected to be discussed wednesday in berlin , during a meeting between the german government and european commission president jose manuel barroso . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pressed his case for eu accession during her six months as eu president merkel said germany would try to " make europe closer to its citizens , " by attempting to answer the " skeptical questions " europeans are asking themselves about the union . " is n't there too much bureaucracy ?
can europe protect our security ?
are we not out of our depth , because we ca n't clearly establish our borders ? " the german chancellor asked , citing several such questions she want to answer . eu borders need definition she also urged europe to delineate its borders , and called for open discussions with turkey . " the adhesion negotiation with turkey should take place without any preconceived objective , " merkel said . turkey 's potential membership is a divisive issue within the 25-member block , and some countries are deeply skeptical about admitting the large and populous muslim state .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

" it 's up to them to prove they belong , " löw told reporters .
" the important thing is that they get a little taste of the international team and learn how it feels to be part of the elite .

slovakia are in third with three points . georgia focused on friendly meanwhile georgia regard germany as an important test ahead of a euro 2008 group b qualifier against italy on wednesday . toppmöller , appointed coach in february , says he and his team are still in a learning process , with the aim in a difficult qualifying group to make life as difficult as possible for the likes of world champions italy , france and ukraine .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .

there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .

" in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said .

" karen fischer and christian struwe did ground-breaking work to reconstruct a functioning media apparatus in afghanistan , " he said .
" it is tragic that karen fischer and christian struwe had to die in the country that they have personally supported over the past years . " pair had worked with isaf troops in berlin , the defense ministry said the two had not been under german military protection at the time of their death . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , however , said it had been informed of the killings . " the journalists , at the time , were not part of any engagements with isaf forces and were operating independently , " isaf spokesman major dominic white said in kabul , adding that the pair had been working in cooperation with isaf until wednesday .

" that is not our goal .
we only attack americans and their supporters . " bamiyan , the journalists ' reported destination , is the site of the ancient statues of the buddha that were blown up by the taliban regime in march 2001 , months before the us-led invasion that started oct .

he added that the pair 's car , cameras and other equipment had not been stolen . afghanistan 's north calmer than the south baghlan is relatively calm and has seen little of the taliban-linked violence that is plaguing southern and eastern afghanistan although unrest has increased there this year . unknown gunmen killed a canadian carpenter in baghlan in july .
mike frastacky , 56 , had been working for four years to build a school in the area .
the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and an afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years in deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .
she traveled to the area a number of times for deutsche welle , filing reports on a number of issues including the afghan elections . christian struwe helped set up and train journalists for radio television afghanistan 's international news department , a public project supported by the deutsche welle .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said . " recently there was no security incidents in those areas , " bashary said .
" i do n't know what happened this time ... we are working on that . " bildunterschrift : steinmeier calls for justice german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the journalists ' deaths . " this heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice , " he said while expressing his condolences to the victims ' families , friends and colleagues . deutsche welle director general erik bettermann also gave his condolences to fischer and struwe 's families and praised their work in the middle east . " karen fischer and christian struwe did ground-breaking work to reconstruct a functioning media apparatus in afghanistan , " he said .
" it is tragic that karen fischer and christian struwe had to die in the country that they have personally supported over the past years . " pair had worked with isaf troops in berlin , the defense ministry said the two had not been under german military protection at the time of their death . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , however , said it had been informed of the killings . " the journalists , at the time , were not part of any engagements with isaf forces and were operating independently , " isaf spokesman major dominic white said in kabul , adding that the pair had been working in cooperation with isaf until wednesday .

he added that the pair 's car , cameras and other equipment had not been stolen . afghanistan 's north calmer than the south baghlan is relatively calm and has seen little of the taliban-linked violence that is plaguing southern and eastern afghanistan although unrest has increased there this year . unknown gunmen killed a canadian carpenter in baghlan in july .
mike frastacky , 56 , had been working for four years to build a school in the area .
the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and an afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years in deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .
she traveled to the area a number of times for deutsche welle , filing reports on a number of issues including the afghan elections . christian struwe helped set up and train journalists for radio television afghanistan 's international news department , a public project supported by the deutsche welle .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states was held and questioned at a us air force facility in germany . two other guantanamo prisoners are also reported by reprieve to have said they were aware of terror suspects who were interrogated in prisons in germany . politicians call for additional inquiry politicians in germany reacted cautiously , calling for further investigation of the allegations . " in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .

there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states was held and questioned at a us air force facility in germany . two other guantanamo prisoners are also reported by reprieve to have said they were aware of terror suspects who were interrogated in prisons in germany . politicians call for additional inquiry politicians in germany reacted cautiously , calling for further investigation of the allegations . " in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .

" in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.10.2006 female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female imam can better reach muslim women , argue some turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions .

" we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast , which outlined german priorities as rotating president of the eu in 2007 . those priorities are expected to be discussed wednesday in berlin , during a meeting between the german government and european commission president jose manuel barroso . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pressed his case for eu accession during her six months as eu president merkel said germany would try to " make europe closer to its citizens , " by attempting to answer the " skeptical questions " europeans are asking themselves about the union . " is n't there too much bureaucracy ?
can europe protect our security ?
are we not out of our depth , because we ca n't clearly establish our borders ? " the german chancellor asked , citing several such questions she want to answer . eu borders need definition she also urged europe to delineate its borders , and called for open discussions with turkey .

" we currently have adhesion discussions with croatia and with turkey , but we also know that in the foreseeable future , we ca n't accept any other member states , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast , which outlined german priorities as rotating president of the eu in 2007 . those priorities are expected to be discussed wednesday in berlin , during a meeting between the german government and european commission president jose manuel barroso . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan pressed his case for eu accession during her six months as eu president merkel said germany would try to " make europe closer to its citizens , " by attempting to answer the " skeptical questions " europeans are asking themselves about the union . " is n't there too much bureaucracy ?
can europe protect our security ?
are we not out of our depth , because we ca n't clearly establish our borders ? " the german chancellor asked , citing several such questions she want to answer . eu borders need definition she also urged europe to delineate its borders , and called for open discussions with turkey . " the adhesion negotiation with turkey should take place without any preconceived objective , " merkel said . turkey 's potential membership is a divisive issue within the 25-member block , and some countries are deeply skeptical about admitting the large and populous muslim state .
merkel is one of the leading proponents of offering turkey a " ' privileged partnership " instead of full eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will lead the for six months at the start of 2007 the eu commission is due to release a report next month on whether turkey has made enough progress in reforms to qualify for eu entry amid warnings that membership negotiations may be suspended unless turkey opens full trade relations with cyprus , which joined the eu along with nine other countries in 2004 . as for the stalled european constitution , the german leader said europe needed a " constitutional contract that clarifies which responsibilities belong to europe , and which to nation states . " last month , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany would focus on creating a timetable to revive the european constitution , which french and dutch voters rejected by last summer .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .

it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt literature -pipe- 07.10.2006 " bombay is a city of extremes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tyrewala said he grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family altaf tyrewala , whose debut novel " no god in sight " received rave reviews in germany and is featured at the frankfurt book fair , spoke with dw-world.de about bombay and its underlying tensions that inspired his book . altaf tyrewala was born in 1977 in bombay .
he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.10.2006 female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a female imam can better reach muslim women , argue some turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way . " nihat halici -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- german mistrust of muslims and islam grows experts fear new conflicts after a study published this week showed most germans doubt the western and islamic worlds can peacefully coexist .
mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing .
-lrb- 20.05.2006 -rrb- analysts : pope lacks john paul 's talent for diffusing tensions pope benedict xvi has failed to heal the rift created by his recent comments on islam due to a lack of the kind of grand gesture mastered by the more media-savvy john paul ii , analysts believe .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .

there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .

for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .

there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman . when amina wadud , professor of islamic studies at the virginia commonwealth university in richmond , led a friday prayer for muslims of both genders in new york last year , conservative muslims from around the world responded with outrage and religious leaders in egypt and saudi arabia even spoke of an american conspiracy . supporting wadud 's action was a violation of god 's law , said grand mufti sheikh abdelaziz al-sheikh .
after all , she is a woman . in secular turkey , and in the mosques in germany that are indirectly controlled by the turkish state , female imams are already in place .
as religious leaders , they preach and pray - but only with other women . more female imams to be sent from turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these turkish girls in berlin are attending a quran school " the congregations have been very pleased " with the female imams , said ridvan cakir , chairman of the turkish-islamic union in germany -lrb- ditib -rrb- .
there have only been 13 so far , but the number is expected to increase . " practically all of our mosques have started asking us for females imams , " cakir said .
" some also ask for male imams whose wives are also preachers .
then they can take care of the women in the congregation while their husbands work with the men . " more than 2.5 million people of turkish origin live in germany today , according to the state department .
there are around 3,000 mosques in the country , which serve the 3.5 million muslims living in germany , many of whom are turkish . cakir explained that it is common for the state-run religious council in turkey , the diyanet , to send female staff members to germany for one or two years to work in a mosque - and these women are in high demand . women also eligible for " enlightenment " " in the past , women sat at home , did n't go to school , have a job or earn any money , " said beyza bilgin , a turkish religion expert .
" but according to islam , all people should become enlightened , acquire knowledge , learn and be educated , regardless of gender . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 3,000 mosques in germany , including this one in essen even if many moderates agree that the genders are fundamentally equal , some skepticism remains as to whether women should be given religious leadership positions . " muslims , especially the men , do n't really like to be taught by a woman , let alone led in prayer by one , " said felix hörner , the head priest at the catholic church in ankara .
" but the catholics could be accused of having a similar problem . " some catholics have similar difficulty with women leaders hörner instructs the germany-bound imams about religion in his country and advises them to contact christian churches when they arrive .
for him , it is a positive step that the diyanet is increasingly entrusting women with religious responsibilities . " these imams are mainly sent from turkey to work with turkish women living in germany , " he said .
" they can reach circles that a male imam in germany never could .
i think that the female imams are able to convey the potential for enlightenment in a very credible way . " nihat halici -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- german mistrust of muslims and islam grows experts fear new conflicts after a study published this week showed most germans doubt the western and islamic worlds can peacefully coexist .
mistrust of the 3 million muslims living in germany appears to be growing .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said . " recently there was no security incidents in those areas , " bashary said .
" i do n't know what happened this time ... we are working on that . " bildunterschrift : steinmeier calls for justice german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the journalists ' deaths . " this heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice , " he said while expressing his condolences to the victims ' families , friends and colleagues . deutsche welle director general erik bettermann also gave his condolences to fischer and struwe 's families and praised their work in the middle east . " karen fischer and christian struwe did ground-breaking work to reconstruct a functioning media apparatus in afghanistan , " he said .
" it is tragic that karen fischer and christian struwe had to die in the country that they have personally supported over the past years . " pair had worked with isaf troops in berlin , the defense ministry said the two had not been under german military protection at the time of their death . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , however , said it had been informed of the killings . " the journalists , at the time , were not part of any engagements with isaf forces and were operating independently , " isaf spokesman major dominic white said in kabul , adding that the pair had been working in cooperation with isaf until wednesday .
" we do n't know the circumstances of their death . " taliban denies targeting journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after the us-led war in afghanistan , much of the country remains unsafe taliban leaders denied any involvement in fischer and struwe 's deaths .

" that is not our goal .
we only attack americans and their supporters . " bamiyan , the journalists ' reported destination , is the site of the ancient statues of the buddha that were blown up by the taliban regime in march 2001 , months before the us-led invasion that started oct .
7 and brought down the fundamentalist government . fischer and struwe 's bodies were discovered saturday and brought to the provincial capital pul-i-khumri where officials found passes identifying them as journalists , according to provincial governor said ekramuddin massumie .
he added that the pair 's car , cameras and other equipment had not been stolen . afghanistan 's north calmer than the south baghlan is relatively calm and has seen little of the taliban-linked violence that is plaguing southern and eastern afghanistan although unrest has increased there this year . unknown gunmen killed a canadian carpenter in baghlan in july .
mike frastacky , 56 , had been working for four years to build a school in the area .
the circumstances behind his murder are still unclear . three foreign and an afghan journalists were killed in a brutal attack in afghanistan in november 2001 as they were approaching kabul to do a story on the fall of the extremist taliban regime in a us-led invasion . karen fischer freelanced for the past three years in deutsche welle 's english and german radio programs and focused her work on conflicts in the middle east as well as the reconstruction of afghanistan .
she traveled to the area a number of times for deutsche welle , filing reports on a number of issues including the afghan elections . christian struwe helped set up and train journalists for radio television afghanistan 's international news department , a public project supported by the deutsche welle .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

he studied advertising and marketing in new york before returning to bombay to work on his debut novel " no god in sight . "
a breathless page-turner which hurtles through the landscape of bombay and its teeming 17 million people , the book tells the story of the city 's ordinary citizens , betraying some of the tensions and divisions underpinning the city 's freewheeling multicultural spirit . dw-world.de caught up with the author at the ongoing frankfurt book fair . dw-world.de : your book is among six novels set in bombay by indian writers in english that have received a lot of attention in germany in the build-up to the book fair .
how do you explain this surge of interest in the city ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombay reflects the struggle and strife of life there altaf tyrewala : bombay is a very strange city .
it 's ironic that though india is a vast country , the nation 's most important metropolis had to be forged on a tiny island and we actually reclaimed land from the sea .
so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .

so there is struggle and strife in the very blood of the city and a lot of hard work has gone into just building it .
that struggle is reflected in all aspects of our lives - whether it 's travel , work or education - and that leads to a lot of drama .
it also leads to a lot of insight into life itself , gives you a perspective and where there 's conflict and struggle , art breeds too .
i think that 's probably true of any major metropolis , be it new york or berlin . while i am glad that " no god in sight " is being called a bombay novel , it was never my intention to write a self-consciously bombay novel .
my attempt was to capture individual stories and account for people who are rarely looked at in literature or in life , and if the city has somehow been captured , that is incidental . the underlying theme of your novel is religious extremism , with several subtle references to the riots between hindus and muslims in bombay in 1992-93 that left at least 1,400 people dead .
how did those events affect you as a muslim ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- " happens at a subtle level i was in the city when the religious riots happened in 1992 and 1993 .
i grew up in a fairly liberal , middle class muslim family and i have n't actually suffered directly communalism or religious discrimination .
but i am a sensitive person and i do pick up on the nuances of daily life .
there is a poisoning of daily interaction -lrb- between hindus and muslims -rrb- at a very subtle level , but the lower down you go in the economic strata , at a very gross level . though there have been sectarian riots in bombay earlier , the one in 1992 was different because for the first time we felt the authorities were in cahoots with the majority community and that 's where the real shock lay for the minorities .
the realization that this is no longer an equal fight , this is no longer civilians fighting each other but a system that 's turning against its own subjects .
and we saw that proved again in gujarat , so the paranoia has almost deepened in a way . the characters in your book are largely muslim .
was that deliberate ? it was not a conscious decision to write about muslims .
at the same time , if was , say , a bengali hindu , i would not have written this book .
i am aware of the extra attention being given to this muslim milieu since the riots - a milieu that i 've grown up in and know intimately .
i also attempted to humanize and examine certain characteristics of the milieu , such as extreme religiosity at times , the lack of self-awareness , the unwillingness to question one 's environment and condition .
so maybe the characters in my book represent the ideal characters which i would like my community to have - people who are restless and curious about the origin of their own thoughts , of their own prejudices and their own inherited beliefs . have the events of the early 1990s created permanent barriers between hindus and muslims in bombay , a city that prides itself on its cultural and religious diversity ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lines between communities in bombay are hard to demarcate i live in byculla -lrb- a neighborhood in southern bombay -rrb- which is a quasi ghetto , home to muslims but also to catholics , gujaratis .
mumbai , unfortunately , is a much-ghettoized city and the two communities -lrb- hindus and muslims -rrb- today are insular to the extent that it would be fairly difficult for me as a muslim to move to kandivali or ghatkopar -lrb- both neighborhoods with large hindu populations -rrb- for instance .
the landlords there would not even entertain me if i wanted to buy or rent a flat . at the same time , given the geography of the city and its size , it 's impossible to have a strict demarcation between religious communities .
i know of other cities in india that have a strict demarcation " that 's india and that 's pakistan . "
it would be impossible to do that in bombay because you never know where one area begins and ends .
it 's such a tightly-packed place that prejudices have to be abandoned for economics and housing reasons . but i hope that i 've also captured in my novel other extremes .
the extremes of economic divergence , of people who live in this closeted , cocooned air-conditioned existence - that for me is the real bombay as against the mumbai of the people who take the trains everyday , who live in tiny flats and who have no real way out of this continuous discomfort that really represents mumbai .
it 's a city divided on the basis of basic lifestyles .
bombay is a city of extremes - of economics , social strata and ideologies . at 29 , you 're one of the youngest authors to represent india at the frankfurt book fair .
what prompted your writing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood movies could n't keep tyrewala 's homesickness at bay i went to new york to study business when i was 18 .
the idea was to study there , get a green card and a fat salary and fulfill an indian cliché in a way .
but i had n't counted on feeling so enormously homesick .
i did n't have money to visit india at a stretch for four years , and i threw myself into indian literature in english to get a feel of home , bollywood just did n't cut it for me .
i read almost all the major contemporary indian writers in english and realized the power of literature and felt that i wanted to do the same , engage with reality and dig deeper below the surface .
i came back to india armed with a major in advertising and marketing and a minor in writing . the structure and form of your slim novel , which is a series of short , fast-paced narratives , has come in for special praise from critics .
how did that come about ? i worked as an instructional writer for various software companies in bombay for a year , writing programs for e-learning packages .
and that was extremely instructive because it taught me the art of brevity and the skill of making your point quick .
that bled into my novel , which is made up of short chunk-sized stories .
at the same time , i realized when i began writing that the conventional novel would n't work when writing about mumbai , which has so many realities , truths and stories pressing in .
in part , the form of the novel also emerged with my tiredness with words .
i joined college when the internet was gaining ground and grew up in a fairly hyper-textual environment - reading , chatting on the internet .
a kind of word poisoning set in .
so the form had to do with writing as little as possible and capturing as much as possible . bombay also has a new image abroad as an economic and financial hub of the new globalizing india .
will that melt the old divisions plaguing the city ? at the heart of all turmoil is economics .
when there is huge economic disparity , the so-called " vested interest " will zero in on any divide it can .
the hindu-muslim is just one divide in india which tends to have the loudest and the most sexy appeal in the media .
but there are so many other divides . of course , it 's a great thing that we have jobs and that we 've found ourselves able to service the information age .
a lot of people are earning good salaries .
a lot of good is emerging from this , the money is slowly trickling down to the masses from the classes .
my only concern is that we ought not to fully buy into the image that we would like to project outside .
there 's a lot of work to be done in our backyard and if we don ’ t also divert our money and energy into correcting our own problems i don ’ t see how long we can sustain our good times . sonia phalnikar interviewed altaf tyrewala send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de indian writers in english open new chapter in europe as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves .

" the sound of the shooting was heard by some of the villagers , who ran toward that area , " provincial police chief mohammad azim hashami said .
" they found a tent and they found the two journalists dead . " fischer and struwe had camped in baghlan , about 150 kilometers -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- northwest of kabul , en route to the central province of bamiyan , afghan interior ministry spokesman zemari bashary said . " they were killed by unidentified people in their tent , " he said , adding that authorities are currently investigating the situation . police were stumped for a motive , an interior ministry spokesman in the capital kabul said . " recently there was no security incidents in those areas , " bashary said .
" i do n't know what happened this time ... we are working on that . " bildunterschrift : steinmeier calls for justice german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the journalists ' deaths . " this heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice , " he said while expressing his condolences to the victims ' families , friends and colleagues . deutsche welle director general erik bettermann also gave his condolences to fischer and struwe 's families and praised their work in the middle east . " karen fischer and christian struwe did ground-breaking work to reconstruct a functioning media apparatus in afghanistan , " he said .
" it is tragic that karen fischer and christian struwe had to die in the country that they have personally supported over the past years . " pair had worked with isaf troops in berlin , the defense ministry said the two had not been under german military protection at the time of their death . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , however , said it had been informed of the killings . " the journalists , at the time , were not part of any engagements with isaf forces and were operating independently , " isaf spokesman major dominic white said in kabul , adding that the pair had been working in cooperation with isaf until wednesday .
" we do n't know the circumstances of their death . " taliban denies targeting journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after the us-led war in afghanistan , much of the country remains unsafe taliban leaders denied any involvement in fischer and struwe 's deaths .

german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany . the allegations were reported to mannheim officials by an anonymous source who claimed to have received the information from a third party , according to frank wallenta , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ' office . a witness had told prosecutors he had heard a us soldier refer to the detentions at the military facility in mannheim near frankfurt , the online edition of the german magazine stern reported . " the question is whether facts are behind this , or not , " wallenta said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramstein air base is already at the center of a german investigation the us military said no foreigners have been held in germany since 1999 .
the united states maintains a confinement facility in mannheim that is allowed to hold only us service members , navy capt. jeff gradeck , director for public affairs at the us military 's european command told the associated press . germany denied allegations on friday that there were any high-level al qaeda prisoners , including an accused mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , held at secret us prisons on its soil . " there is nothing behind these allegations , " german government spokesman thomas steg told reporters , adding that there were not , and had never been , any secret american prisons in germany . allegations stem from guantanamo prisoners reprieve , a british charity representing detainees held by the united states at its guantanamo bay prison camp , published similar allegations on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three guantanamo prisoners claimed the us had a prison in germany reprieve said one guantanamo detainee , binyam mohamed , reported he was told by moroccan intelligence officers in 2003 or the beginning of 2004 that a key person in the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states was held and questioned at a us air force facility in germany . two other guantanamo prisoners are also reported by reprieve to have said they were aware of terror suspects who were interrogated in prisons in germany . politicians call for additional inquiry politicians in germany reacted cautiously , calling for further investigation of the allegations . " in my opinion , the allegations are really very , very weak , " german european parliament member wolfgang kreissl-dörfler told reporters .
" i 'm skeptical , but it 's necessary to look at it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want the issue to be examined in an official inquiry he added that german officials were looking into us renditions that allegedly took place in 2003 at ramstein air force base and that authorities should also investigate reprieve 's report . a 2005 washington post report about the possibility of terror suspects being held at secret us prisons in eastern europe set off a number of inquires , which has thus far not turned up any of the alleged detention centers .
the only european nations suspected of hosting such prisons are poland and romania . us president george w. bush acknowledged last month that the cia operated secret prisons to hold and interrogate high-level al-qaeda figures captured since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks . the 46-member council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's top human rights watchdog , said in a recent report that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , which transported detainees to other states for interrogation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suspected cia abductors identified journalists from german broadcaster ard said they uncovered the identities of three alleged cia pilots who helped to kidnap german citizen khaled el-masri , who was imprisoned in afghanistan .

under the proposal , a second european crewmember would be added to the planned october 2007 shuttle flight slated to deliver the columbus research laboratory to the platform .
news of the idea came from germany 's hans schlegel , a member of the shuttle crew .
unlike schlegel and his five american crewmates who would return home after about a week at the iss , the second european astronaut would remain aboard the complex for 2- 2.5 months , to begin science experiments in the new lab .
if the proposal was approved , france 's leopold eyharts would be under consideration for the slot , schlegel said .
shuttle shuffle " right now it 's under negotiations ; but the position of the international partners is that as soon as their module comes up , -lsb- they want -rsb- to have an astronaut available onboard who is focusing on activating , checking out and starting the experiment flow on that individual module , " schlegel said .
" it 's pretty much supported by all parties , " he added .
the proposal would have eyharts return with the next shuttle crew and a japanese astronaut take over his slot on the station for another two months .
a third rotation would bring canada 's first resident station crewmember to the outpost with the following shuttle flight .
the trio of mini-missions would take the place of one of the existing three , six-month resident slots currently held by nasa 's michael lopez-alegria , russia 's mikhail tyurin and europe 's thomas reiter .
" there are a number of proposals under consideration , " said melissa matthews , a spokeswoman with the us space agency .
" we ca n't comment on any specifics at this time . "
nasa eventually plans to expand the station crew to six , full-time resident crewmembers .
growing structure last month , the agency resumed space station construction after a hiatus of nearly four years due to safety upgrades implemented after the 2003 shuttle columbia disaster .
nasa has a firm deadline to finish construction of the half-built outpost by 2010 when the shuttle fleet is retired .
the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- columbus module will be the first of the partner laboratories to be added to the station , which now includes the united states ' destiny laboratory ; the russian zvezda service module ; the us-financed , russian-built zarya propellant and storage module ; two airlocks and the unity connecting node .
canada provided the station 's mobile robotic crane and support equipment .
before columbus can fly , however , nasa must reconfigure the station 's electrical system , finish building the station 's structural trusses , install two more sets of power-generating solar arrays and deliver a second connecting node to serve as docking port for the partner modules .
the next assembly mission is scheduled for launch in december .

under the proposal , a second european crewmember would be added to the planned october 2007 shuttle flight slated to deliver the columbus research laboratory to the platform .
news of the idea came from germany 's hans schlegel , a member of the shuttle crew .
unlike schlegel and his five american crewmates who would return home after about a week at the iss , the second european astronaut would remain aboard the complex for 2- 2.5 months , to begin science experiments in the new lab .
if the proposal was approved , france 's leopold eyharts would be under consideration for the slot , schlegel said .
shuttle shuffle " right now it 's under negotiations ; but the position of the international partners is that as soon as their module comes up , -lsb- they want -rsb- to have an astronaut available onboard who is focusing on activating , checking out and starting the experiment flow on that individual module , " schlegel said .
" it 's pretty much supported by all parties , " he added .
the proposal would have eyharts return with the next shuttle crew and a japanese astronaut take over his slot on the station for another two months .
a third rotation would bring canada 's first resident station crewmember to the outpost with the following shuttle flight .
the trio of mini-missions would take the place of one of the existing three , six-month resident slots currently held by nasa 's michael lopez-alegria , russia 's mikhail tyurin and europe 's thomas reiter .
" there are a number of proposals under consideration , " said melissa matthews , a spokeswoman with the us space agency .
" we ca n't comment on any specifics at this time . "
nasa eventually plans to expand the station crew to six , full-time resident crewmembers .
growing structure last month , the agency resumed space station construction after a hiatus of nearly four years due to safety upgrades implemented after the 2003 shuttle columbia disaster .
nasa has a firm deadline to finish construction of the half-built outpost by 2010 when the shuttle fleet is retired .
the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- columbus module will be the first of the partner laboratories to be added to the station , which now includes the united states ' destiny laboratory ; the russian zvezda service module ; the us-financed , russian-built zarya propellant and storage module ; two airlocks and the unity connecting node .
canada provided the station 's mobile robotic crane and support equipment .

these problem programs can arrive via e-mail , instant messenger , through your internet connection or even your web browser if you visit the wrong website .
the threats are so numerous and appear so fast that windows users must feel under siege .
while there is no doubt that attacks on pc users are getting more sophisticated , it is possible to avoid the vast majority of problems by taking some straight-forward steps and exercising some common sense .
if you are worried about your computer it is possible to scan it via the web to see if it is infected .
companies such as trend micro , kaspersky and microsoft all offer free scanning services .
organisations such as the computer emergency response team -lrb- cert -rrb- also offer advice on how to set up a safe net connection .
anti-virus the first piece of security software every pc user needs is some anti-virus software .
it must also be regularly updated to ensure it protects you against the latest threats .
one of the ways that virus writers try to catch out anti-virus software is by pumping out enormous numbers of variations of their malicious creations .
good anti-virus programs use heuristic techniques to spot viruses that have not been formally identified but have all the characteristics .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats hi-tech crime : a glossary many pcs now come with anti-virus installed and though an annual subscription can seem expensive , it might be cheap when you consider how much it could save you if it stops your bank details being stolen .
as well as retail versions of anti-virus there are now some free programs that do a good job of protecting you .
avira , avast and avg all produce free anti-virus software .
microsoft now sells a package of security programs but , so far , they are only available to us users .
firewall a firewall is also an essential piece of security software for pc users .
newer versions of windows xp have a firewall built in and this will give you protection against nuisance attacks and many of the more serious ones .
hi-tech crime plans the bbc news website is running a series of features throughout the week tuesday : what did we catch in our honeypot ?
wednesday : anatomy of a spam e-mail and hackers face to face thursday : how to spot a phishing scam however some people feel that the windows xp firewall is a bit limited in its features .
many anti-virus programs have a firewall bundled with them .
there are free firewalls available too from firms such as comodo and zone alarm .
to block some of the attacks it can also be useful to connect to the net via a hub or router .
often these have a firewall built in and , even if not , will do a good job of blocking a lot of the low level attacks .
spyware increasingly simply browsing the web can subject you to all kinds of dangers .
specially crafted websites can initiate so-called " drive-by downloads " that exploit weaknesses in microsoft 's internet explorer browser to install programs you never asked for .
at best these will annoy you with pop-up ads , at worst they will let someone else take control of your pc .
anti-spyware software will help stop these taking hold and help you clean up your pc if you do get hit .
there are add-ons for browsers , such as mcafee 's site advisor that warn you about potentially harmful sites .
also google has now started warning when you are about to visit a potentially unsafe site .
search sites such as scandoo will also flag sites loaded with malware .
these days adware tends to be very aggressive and it is far better to avoid an infection than try to clean up afterwards .
security experts recommend migrating away from internet explorer to a browser such as firefox or opera .
at the very least they say to keep microsoft 's browser up to date with patches .
anti-spyware activists suzi turner and eric howes run a website that lists the bogus security products to help you avoid falling victim .
microsoft makes free anti-spyware but there are many other products from firms such as lavasoft and spybot .
update with windows it is also important to keep your system up to date .
windows xp now regularly nags people about upgrades and microsoft produces security patches on a monthly basis .
microsoft recommends automatic updating so patches are downloaded and applied as soon as they become available .
as the time between the announcement of a vulnerability and it being exploited is shrinking , it pays to act quickly .
the other things you can do to stay safe fall into the realm of common sense .
to begin with never open an attachment on an e-mail you were not expecting - even if it appears to come from someone you know .
never reply to spam e-mail messages as that just confirms your address is live and makes it more valuable .
be wary of any e-mailed message about online financial accounts you own .
learn to spot the signs of phishing e-mails .
apple apple users who feel confident that they are invulnerable to attacks should also take steps to protect themselves .
while virus attacks are virtually unheard of , the platform can be subject to malware and adware .
the firewall on an apple computer should be switched on and common sense regarding potential phishing attacks should be applied .

bethan mason is heading to california for the world surfing games .
at 16 she is the youngest member by six years of the british team , which also includes gemma harris from aberavon .
bethan , the welsh under-18 girls ' champion , said she never expected to be selected and was " over the moon " to be going to huntingdon beach .
she started surfing about five years ago and now gets out in the water as often as she can .
" i got into surfing when i was in a lifeguard club so then i got surf lessons and just went from there really , " she said .
" around here there 's a group of girls who surf , which is really good because we all go together and push each other .
" my local break is langland and i like surfing at pwlldu point .
llangennith is good as well because that 's the point that picks up the most surf .
" i 've not been at home for a weekend for such a long time now , just going away for contests . "
the team flies to the united states on tuesday .
for bethan to have achieved this at such a young age illustrates just how talented she is karen walton , national director of the british surfing association bethan , from the mayals area of the city and a pupil at ysgol gyfun gwyr , said she was just pleased to be taking part .
" i did not think i would get chosen and had not really thought about it .
when i got the letter i was over the moon .
" it will be a really good experience just to watch all the really good surfers and see what their tactics are .
' pinnacle ' " the contest is a week long - we will get there a few days before to acclimatise and get over the jet-lag .
" they have an opening ceremony and then there will be heats all week with the finals at the end .
" the heats normally last 15 to 20 minutes and you have to catch 10 or 12 waves and they judge you on power , style .
" you get the most points in the critical part of the wave which is just where the wave is breaking . "
karen walton , national director of the british surfing association said : " achieving a place on the british team obviously represents the pinnacle of a career for many uk surfers .
" for bethan to have achieved this at such a young age is a major success for her surfing career and illustrates just how talented she is . "

despite saudi arabia 's wealth as the world 's biggest oil exporter , many of the new generation of saudis are restless , bored and unemployed in the desert kingdom .
eleven pm on the corniche , the coastal road along the red sea in saudi arabia 's second city , jeddah .
and in the relative cool of the evening , families are out walking along the seafront , kids are riding on donkeys , and young men are driving beach buggies along the sand .
there is a festive mood .
it is the eve of ramadan , the muslim month of fasting , and also the eve of national day - and already the cars driving along the corniche are sounding their horns - and young men are dancing in the street and draping themselves in the green saudi flag .
it was not until the following day that a friend pointed out what i had failed to realise - that many of these young men belong to the ranks of the new saudi unemployed .
their patriotic fervour may have been genuine - but it was also an escape from shame and boredom .
segregation why such a rich country , enjoying its third year of high oil prices , should have a serious unemployment problem is , on the face of it , a puzzle .
for many people , the saudi idea of a night out is to go shopping - or just sit in a coffee-shop or a fast-food restaurant .
but the main causes are a chronic dependence on an army of foreign workers - and an education system that is failing to equip young saudis with the skills the workplace needs .
the result is a lot of bored and frustrated young people with a lot of time on their hands - and the fear that some are drifting into crime or drugs or even religious militancy .
saudi arabia is a gender segregated society , so it is hard for young men and young women to meet .
cinemas and theatres are not allowed .
and , for many people , the saudi idea of a night out is to go shopping - or just sit in a coffee-shop or a fast-food restaurant .
but , as i heard from a group of students , even these places can be no-go areas : shopping centres and restaurants are anxious to be seen as family-friendly - so single young males are often kept out .
and there is also a dress code : despite the oppressive heat , there is no way you can come in wearing bermuda shorts .
like young people everywhere , young saudis go to great lengths to bypass irksome restrictions .
mobile phones and the internet have had a liberating effect .
they find places for illicit meetings .
they find ways of swapping phone numbers .
in jeddah , the mood is noticeably more relaxed than i had found in the capital riyadh .
one filipino waiter in a coffee-shop told me that when he had worked in riyadh , he had been arrested by the religious police for not being strict enough in shutting his shop during prayer times , or in stopping young men from entering the family section - but here in jeddah , he said , the religious police were much less of a nuisance .
to escape boredom , some young saudis simply go abroad , especially in the burning heat of the summer - perhaps to spain or morocco , perhaps to nearby dubai or bahrain where the social climate is more open .
one young man told me it was in bahrain that he had bought a copy of a controversial novel called " the girls of riyadh " - which has caused quite a stir in saudi arabia with its outspoken account of the lives , including the sex lives , of four young women .
rajaa al-sanei 's book has caused a stir in saudi arabia the author , a young saudi woman called rajaa al-sanei , is currently in the united states .
that did not stop conservatives trying to take her to court for allegedly slandering the saudi nation ; but the case was thrown out .
young saudis who have read the book told me it is not great literature - but it is essentially accurate , whatever the conservatives may say .
there are other forms of escape .
mobile phones and the internet have had a liberating effect .
over the last 18 months or so , there has been a boom in saudi blogging .
there are now 500 or 600 bloggers , women as well as men , using english as well as arabic .
in a restaurant in riyadh full of young men peering into their laptops , i met ahmed , a student who blogs under the name " saudijeans " .
hate mail in such a closed society , the internet is one of the few places where young saudis can discuss - either openly or anonymously - the things that matter to them .
for ahmed , that means freedom of expression and human rights - or an article he has just read in a newspaper .
for the young woman who blogs under the name " mystique " , it means testing the limits of what can be said about sex and religion - issues that , not surprisingly in such a conservative society , bring her plenty of hate mail .
in some ways saudi arabia is changing .
you now see young saudis working in coffee-shops or at the reception desks of the big hotels - jobs they previously disdained .
the newspapers , though still controlled by the government , now write about issues - such as crime , poverty , aids and domestic abuse - that not long ago were taboo .
but change is painfully slow .
and the young are impatient .
once known as the " kingdom of silence " , saudi arabia is now silent no more .

despite saudi arabia 's wealth as the world 's biggest oil exporter , many of the new generation of saudis are restless , bored and unemployed in the desert kingdom .
eleven pm on the corniche , the coastal road along the red sea in saudi arabia 's second city , jeddah .
and in the relative cool of the evening , families are out walking along the seafront , kids are riding on donkeys , and young men are driving beach buggies along the sand .
there is a festive mood .
it is the eve of ramadan , the muslim month of fasting , and also the eve of national day - and already the cars driving along the corniche are sounding their horns - and young men are dancing in the street and draping themselves in the green saudi flag .
it was not until the following day that a friend pointed out what i had failed to realise - that many of these young men belong to the ranks of the new saudi unemployed .
their patriotic fervour may have been genuine - but it was also an escape from shame and boredom .
segregation why such a rich country , enjoying its third year of high oil prices , should have a serious unemployment problem is , on the face of it , a puzzle .
for many people , the saudi idea of a night out is to go shopping - or just sit in a coffee-shop or a fast-food restaurant .
but the main causes are a chronic dependence on an army of foreign workers - and an education system that is failing to equip young saudis with the skills the workplace needs .
the result is a lot of bored and frustrated young people with a lot of time on their hands - and the fear that some are drifting into crime or drugs or even religious militancy .
saudi arabia is a gender segregated society , so it is hard for young men and young women to meet .
cinemas and theatres are not allowed .
and , for many people , the saudi idea of a night out is to go shopping - or just sit in a coffee-shop or a fast-food restaurant .
but , as i heard from a group of students , even these places can be no-go areas : shopping centres and restaurants are anxious to be seen as family-friendly - so single young males are often kept out .
and there is also a dress code : despite the oppressive heat , there is no way you can come in wearing bermuda shorts .
like young people everywhere , young saudis go to great lengths to bypass irksome restrictions .
mobile phones and the internet have had a liberating effect .
they find places for illicit meetings .
they find ways of swapping phone numbers .
in jeddah , the mood is noticeably more relaxed than i had found in the capital riyadh .
one filipino waiter in a coffee-shop told me that when he had worked in riyadh , he had been arrested by the religious police for not being strict enough in shutting his shop during prayer times , or in stopping young men from entering the family section - but here in jeddah , he said , the religious police were much less of a nuisance .
to escape boredom , some young saudis simply go abroad , especially in the burning heat of the summer - perhaps to spain or morocco , perhaps to nearby dubai or bahrain where the social climate is more open .
one young man told me it was in bahrain that he had bought a copy of a controversial novel called " the girls of riyadh " - which has caused quite a stir in saudi arabia with its outspoken account of the lives , including the sex lives , of four young women .
rajaa al-sanei 's book has caused a stir in saudi arabia the author , a young saudi woman called rajaa al-sanei , is currently in the united states .
that did not stop conservatives trying to take her to court for allegedly slandering the saudi nation ; but the case was thrown out .
young saudis who have read the book told me it is not great literature - but it is essentially accurate , whatever the conservatives may say .
there are other forms of escape .
mobile phones and the internet have had a liberating effect .
over the last 18 months or so , there has been a boom in saudi blogging .
there are now 500 or 600 bloggers , women as well as men , using english as well as arabic .
in a restaurant in riyadh full of young men peering into their laptops , i met ahmed , a student who blogs under the name " saudijeans " .
hate mail in such a closed society , the internet is one of the few places where young saudis can discuss - either openly or anonymously - the things that matter to them .
for ahmed , that means freedom of expression and human rights - or an article he has just read in a newspaper .
for the young woman who blogs under the name " mystique " , it means testing the limits of what can be said about sex and religion - issues that , not surprisingly in such a conservative society , bring her plenty of hate mail .
in some ways saudi arabia is changing .
you now see young saudis working in coffee-shops or at the reception desks of the big hotels - jobs they previously disdained .
the newspapers , though still controlled by the government , now write about issues - such as crime , poverty , aids and domestic abuse - that not long ago were taboo .
but change is painfully slow .
and the young are impatient .
once known as the " kingdom of silence " , saudi arabia is now silent no more .

the bank of scotland says the number of properties in this price bracket will at least double in the next five years .
the change means more home buyers will have to pay increased stamp duty charges .
the bank says higher thresholds for the tax have remained unchanged for nine years while average house prices have risen by 107 % over that period .
currently , about 130,000 homes - some 7 % of properties in scotland - are thought to be worth more than £ 250,000 .
but with house prices rising at an average of 5 % a year , it is predicted the number will rise to 320,000 - or 18 % of the country 's homes .
people buying a house worth £ 250,000 or more must pay 3 % of its value in stamp duty charges .
house price inflation five years ago just 1 % of properties were valued at £ 250,000 .
in edinburgh , 17 % of sales are of homes worth more than that figure .
in dalkeith , midlothian , the figure is 16 % , while in ayr , aberdeen and helensburgh 12 % of sales attract the higher rate of stamp duty .
tim crawford , group economist for the bank of scotland , called for the uk government to link stamp duty thresholds to house price inflation .
he said : " paying the higher rates of stamp duty is not as widespread a concern in scotland as it is south of the border , where the average home buyer in one in six towns in england is now facing a stamp duty bill of more than £ 7,500 .
" however , it is likely to become more of an issue unless the government commits to increase the higher stamp duty thresholds in line with the increase in scottish house prices since 1997 . "

the plan follows concern about the welfare of mumbai 's elephants , which are mainly used in religious functions .
four elephants are legally registered in mumbai , but locals believe up to a dozen could be living in the city .
the implants cost 200 rupees -lrb- $ 4.40 -rrb- and will be ready to be implanted into the animals ' ears over the next month .
faked registrations sarfaraz khan , the deputy conservator of forests for mumbai 's thane district , told bbc news that illegal elephants had become a problem for locals .
" some illegal elephants enter the city .
they cause some traffic problems and sometimes they scare some people , also they indulge in begging sometimes .
" these people who have them legally do not create as much problems , " he said .
mr khan said that it was necessary to use the rice grain-sized implants because some elephant owners had been faking their registration certificates by taking photocopies of other owners ' licences .
he said similar registration schemes had been trialled on ceremonial animals elsewhere in india .
" it has been done earlier on leopards also , not in mumbai but in kerala . "
the issue has gained prominence in recent weeks after lakshmi , a 30-year-old elephant used for religious ceremonies , was allegedly struck and killed by a drunk driver .
the incident prompted bollywood actor rahul khanna , a patron of india 's branch of people for the ethical treatment of animals -lrb- peta -rrb- , to call for elephants to be banned from the city .

burberry is consulting the 300 workers at its designer clothing plant in treorchy , rhondda , which is set to close by the end of the year .
plaid cymru mep jill evans joined a protest at the firm 's bond street store calling for the factory to remain open .
burberry , which is to move the plant 's production abroad , declined to comment .
scores of burberry staff demonstrated outside the factory gates on friday after the company said a year-long review had left " no obvious " alternative to the closure .
the factory makes polo shirts and production will go where costs are lower , possibly to asia or south america .
burberry has said the factory is no longer " commercially viable " , but it would not abandon the uk .
the gmb union , one of two unions at the site , said the firm had extended its 90-day consultation period and now said no-one would be made compulsorily redundant before 4 january next year .
ms evans , who lives in the rhondda , said party members from rhondda and london joined the protest at the firm 's three main stores , inviting shoppers to write to the company to ask it to change its mind about the scheduled closure .
she said : " this is such a big issue on the streets of treorchy and treherbert .
almost everyone we 've spoken to has someone who has worked there at some time .
" the impact of this closure would be so devastating .
this is something we all want to do something about . "
' scapheap ' plaid 's london branch secretary huw jackson said : " burberry is all over the international fashion press just now with their new winter collection .
" but behind this facade they 're prepared to put over 300 people on the scrapheap in a valley with little prospect of alternative employment .
that 's what we want to get over to their customers " .
rhondda labour am leighton andrews has urged south wales-born movie star ioan gruffudd , who promotes burberry , to back the campaign to keep the factory open .
mr andrews has told fellow ams : " it 's not clear that burberry 's worldwide management have fully thought through the implications of pulling out of wales when the global face of burberry is the welsh actor ioan gruffudd " .
burberry has three shops in central london , one each in bond street and regent street and one in knightsbridge .
there are also concessions at harrods and harvey nichols .
the firm also has five more shops at heathrow and gatwick airports , one at each of the terminals .
burberry said it was not making any further comment on its plans .

plaid cymru mep jill evans joined a protest at the firm 's bond street store calling for the factory to remain open .
burberry , which is to move the plant 's production abroad , declined to comment .
scores of burberry staff demonstrated outside the factory gates on friday after the company said a year-long review had left " no obvious " alternative to the closure .
ioan gruffudd has appeared in advertising campaigns for burberry the factory makes polo shirts and production will go where costs are lower , possibly to asia or south america .
burberry has said the factory is no longer " commercially viable " , but it would not abandon the uk .
the gmb union , one of two unions at the site , said the firm had extended its 90-day consultation period and now said no-one would be made compulsorily redundant before 4 january next year .
ms evans , who lives in the rhondda , said party members from rhondda and london joined the protest at the firm 's three main stores , inviting shoppers to write to the company to ask it to change its mind about the scheduled closure .
she said : " this is such a big issue on the streets of treorchy and treherbert .

rhondda labour am leighton andrews has urged south wales-born movie star ioan gruffudd , who promotes burberry , to back the campaign to keep the factory open .
mr andrews has told fellow ams : " it 's not clear that burberry 's worldwide management have fully thought through the implications of pulling out of wales when the global face of burberry is the welsh actor ioan gruffudd " .

sir cyril taylor , head of the specialist schools and academies trust , said about 500 schools were seriously underperforming based on gcse results .
the government said that its own survey had identified only about 50 unsatisfactory schools .
teaching groups called sir cyril 's comments unhelpful and demoralising .
' unfairness ' sir cyril 's definition of underperformance is a school in which less than 25 % of pupils achieve five good gcses , including english and maths , or less than 40 % get the equivalent of five good gcses in any subjects .
he estimates there are about 500 such schools , and argues that as long as they remain many parents have no real choice of school .
we do accept that there is a continued need for improvements schools minister lord adonis " there are these 80,000 going to schools that are underperforming , and some very badly underperforming , " he said in a bbc interview .
" that 's what we have got to focus on .
that 's the unfairness .
" they vary so much .
some are so bad they ought to be shut down quickly and some are struggling and need help . "
sir cyril said some parents were able to escape these schools by moving house but added admissions should " not be about the size of your mortgage " .
head teachers college the government says its own definition of low attaining schools identifies only about 50 secondary schools , down from 616 in 1997 , adding that 92 % of parents are able to send their children to their first-choice school .
this figure is based on research it commissioned some years ago .
the department for education and skills -lrb- dfes -rrb- does not collect actual statistics .
have your say it 's not always the school that is at fault , the kids should want to learn sandra , manchester send us your comments birmingham city council last year published its admissions figures , which showed that only 63 % of parents got the secondary school of their choice .
schools minister lord adonis said : " we do accept that there is a continued need for improvements , which is why we 're building 200 completely new academies , many of them directly replacing failing schools .
" they 're highly popular with parents - three applications for every place , " he said .
he said there was a new policy of closing failing schools within a year if they were not being turned around .
and a new national college for head teachers aimed to produce " much better trained leaders of our schools so that schools do n't get into the kind of difficulties that lead them to fail " .
' exaggerated ' mick brookes , general secretary of the national association of head teachers -lrb- naht -rrb- said sir cyril 's comments were " unhelpful " .
he said : " we know we have got a problem with what can be described as underachieving schools .
it does not help to have something like this thrown in your face .
comments like this are very demoralising philip parking , professional association of teachers " whilst , according to sir cyril , there are 80,000 children going to underperforming schools , that means there must be close to eight million children that are doing ok . "
philip parkin , general secretary of the professional association of teachers , said he thought the figures were " exaggerated " .
he said : " i firmly believe the vast majority of teachers are doing an excellent job .
it 's basically scaremongering .
" comments like this are very demoralising , and i think certainly my members will be very unhappy at this when they are working very hard to raise standards . "
the dfes said the admissions system had to be made fairer laura warren , of the national confederation of parent teacher associations , said : " what is so easy to lose sight of is that these are real situations - these are our children who have n't got a school place , at very worst , or they have got a place in a school that was n't their first choice ... it 's real life . "
she added that the schools admissions system was " not understood well enough by parents , and also it 's so varied " .
a dfes spokeswoman said the admissions system had to be made " fair and transparent " to ensure equal opportunities for every child .
" the new school admissions code will help us to create a level playing field where every parent has a fair shot at getting the place they want and will mean that no child is disadvantaged over another , " the spokeswoman said .
