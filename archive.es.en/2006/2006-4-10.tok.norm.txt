" it 's important for the team that i 'm present during the world cup , " the 36-year-old bayern munich star told a press conference .
" it 's not an easy situation .
of course , i was disappointed not to be chosen as first choice after working so hard .
but it 's more important that i give my support to the whole team so that we can achieve our objective - to be world champions . " kahn 's pledge of loyalty to the german squad was immediately welcomed by klinsmann . " my compliments to oliver , " klinsmann said .
" his experience and desire to put himself at the service of the team and to do everything he can to help us in the world cup is very important . " rising above rivalry germany 's general manager oliver bierhoff echoed klinsmann 's sentiments .
" oliver kahn has shown once again that he is a great sportsman , " bierhoff said .
" we hope now that we can continue our preparations for the world cup with some peace and quiet without constantly having to deal with this question of who is going to be in goal , " he added . klinsmann took the unusual step of announcing his support for lehmann on friday , ending a long-running guessing game over who would keep goal for germany at the world cup . " jürgen klinsmann has taken his decision , i 've accepted it , i 've thought about it and i 've decided to do what 's best for the team , " said kahn , adding that he has " no conflict " with his rival lehmann .
" we 've got to rise above talk of a rivalry between kahn and lehmann .
we need to be positive so we can achieve our goal , " said kahn , revealing he had received several messages of support from his international team-mates . " other members of the team and players from different clubs called me after the announcement and told me ' you have to be there , it 's important for the team ' , " kahn said . dw-world.de opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson .
-lrb- april 8 , 2006 -rrb- jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .
-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?
for jürgen klinsmann picking jens lehmann as the starting goalie was the hardest choice of his time at coach of the national team .

" we 're still very cautious , but if these indications are confirmed , that would mean that italy had decided to turn the page and begin a new era , " said a spokesman at prodi 's headquarters . within hours , the vote projections had lurched in the prime minister 's favor .
berlusconi , italy 's richest man , returned to rome from his mansion in arcore , outside milan , in the afternoon , but refrained from making any comments . a nexus projection at 8 p.m. local time for italian state television showed berlusconi 's house of freedoms alliance would take the majority of seats in the race for the senate . majority needed in both houses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians had two days to vote based on the projection made with nearly nine-tenths of the votes counted , berlusconi 's house of freedoms would take 158 seats in the upper house senate against 152 for the union . that was followed by another projection showing berlusconi edging in front by 49.9 percent to 49.6 percent in the lower house chamber of deputies .
vote counting continued into the night . neither of the rival coalitions would be able to govern without a majority in both houses . " you ca n't say that the leftist union has a majority to govern , " said andrea ronchi of the national alliance , a key ally of berlusconi .
" we are neck and neck in the senate , and it 's a great result . " vote counting to continue throughout night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning took on nasty tones partial results announced earlier in the evening , based on a smaller sample of about one-sixth of the vote , gave 54.2 percent to prodi 's center-left and 45.2 percent to berlusconi 's house of freedoms in the lower house . at the time , senator paolo guzzanti of the prime minister 's forza italia party appeared to have given up hope . " our coalition has lost the elections , " he told afp .
" we expected something like this because we 've lost every -lrb- local -rrb- election since 2001 . " first official results from the two-day election were due late monday , but counting was going more slowly than expected as darkness fell over rome . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy takes to the polls dw-world.de presents a dossier of articles following the italian election campaign and the major issues and players .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .

" there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

chancellor angela merkel said her government was scrutinizing the video of engineers thomas nitzschke , 28 , and rene bräunlich , 32 , which was posted on an islamic internet site on sunday . " we are closely scrutinizing the video we have received of the hostages , " merkel said , adding : " we will do everything in our power to save the hostages and to bring them back to germany .

we are close to breaking point .
please help us .
please help us , " he said . the video shows the two hostages looking haggard and wearing beards . in an accompanying statement the kidnappers threatened : " know that if our two demands - the release of all iraqi men and women held in occupation prisons and a halt to all aid to americans and their agents , including shiites - are not met , punishment will be meted out quickly . " those of you who help the occupiers , the infidels and the shiites , know that you and your citizens will not escape the jihadists -lrb- holy warriors -rrb- . " the german foreign ministry said it was analyzing the video to confirm that it indeed featured the two germans who were seized near the baiji oil refinery in northern iraq on january 24 . " we still have to analyze the video , " a spokeswoman told afp . previous videos germans have for weeks feared for the lives of the two men , who both come from leipzig , in the east of the country .
they were working for a german company on short-term contracts when they were seized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photo of the two hostages has been posted at the nicholas church in leipzig their captors have previously released three videos of them , the first just three days after they were taken hostage .
the second was shown on the arabic television channel al-jazeera on jan .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .

the posters are so popular that they keep disappearing . sand , blue skies , brown-skinned backsides - looks like a summer-in-the-sun vacation package .
but " maakt in oostfreesland " is n't a tourist ad for germany 's northwestern , island-studded region .
the campaign is aimed at youngsters " made in east frisia " to spark pride in their native language , the low-german dialect called plattdeutsch .
according to the organization oostfreeske taal , only around 20 to 25 percent of young east frisians speak low-german these days - about 50 percent still understand the language .
the initiative " made in east frisia " wants that to change . stah daarto .

the campaign is aimed at youngsters " made in east frisia " to spark pride in their native language , the low-german dialect called plattdeutsch .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

but a group of young performers in the german capital have updated the classic to mark the composer 's 250th birthday . a male rapper flows to a dj 's beat in the gilded setting of a berlin opera house while a female singer launches into a mozart aria underlaid by the 18th-century tinkle of a harpsichord . welcome to " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop style , as staged at berlin 's renowned komische oper during europe 's year-long celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the composer 's birth . this performance of the beloved 1790 opera , accompanied by a high school orchestra , demonstrates mozart 's enduring power to attract audiences , and inspire new generations anxious to take his work to new places . the 21-year-old sil-yan bori , aka dj craft , works the turntables while the familiar opening notes swell from the orchestra pit as 40 street dancers mount the stage . they had eight months to create their own choreography on the central and eternal themes of " cosi fan tutte " : love , trust and infidelity . one of the dancers , 16-year-old judith scholl , said that before participating in the performance she " fell asleep every time " she went to the opera . the two young military officers , guglielmo -lrb- alias flowinimmo -rrb- and ferrando -lrb- alias bobmalo -rrb- , sport baggy jogging pants and rap the 200-year-old libretto in german . convinced that their girlfriends are true to them , they agree to a bet with their bachelor friend don alfonso who has his doubts about the loyalty of the female sex . pretending to have to leave them to head off to war , the pair reappear disguised as dashing foreigners ready to sweep the women off their feet .
but fiordiligi and dorabella , played by young singers , can not be swayed . classical themes still relevant in modern times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart probably did n't envisage a backdrop like this for his aria the set , looking like any berlin street , is sprayed with graffiti , the brandenburg gate is transformed into a giant ghetto blaster and the landmark television tower is mangled and dented . " cosi , this story about fidelity , happens everyday at school , " says another one of the dancers , deniz deli , a german of turkish origin . the performance gains resonance against the backdrop of increasing violence at berlin schools between arab , turkish and german teenagers which has dominated the headlines in recent weeks . mozart and hip-hop " made for each other " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wolfie m aka wolfgang amadeus mozart organizer markus kosuch said he initiated the show " for the love of mozart " and believes hip hop and opera were made for each other .
" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .
bielefeld came out on top with heiko westermann scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and duisburg split three points both of them needed schalke tie , aiming toward uefa cup schalke drew 1-1 with bottom side msv duisburg on sunday to lose ground on the table leaders . danish international christian poulsen , set to leave the club in the summer , scored an own goal after 39 minutes as duisburg took a shock lead . soren larsen made amends for his compatriot 's error with an 85th minute equalizer but the point is not enough for schalke . " we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post . " we had so many chances but none of them went in , " said bayern 's french defender valerien ismael .

that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party . kurt beck has never expressed the urge to take a greater role in national politics .
in november , when he had the chance to become head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , he stepped aside for matthias platzeck to take the job . it 's not that the 57-year old lacks ambition .
on the contrary , he worked his way up from being an electrician to premier of the western german state of rhineland-palatinate .
he is known for being down-to-earth and pursuing moderate social democratic policies .
he 's not one to experiment , instead introducing change with caution . as rhineland-palatinate premier for 11 years , beck has led the only coalition between the social democrats and the free market liberal free democrats .
his accomplishments and popularity have been such that in state-wide elections three weeks ago , the spd garnered an absolute majority which will allow beck to rule the state alone from mid-may .
old-school social democrat beck views communication as the key to his success .
he shows no reservations about meeting with industrialists or wine-growers .
he regularly makes himself available for meetings with his constituents in his hometown of steinfeld .
some say there 's not a hand in rhineland-palatinate he has n't shaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck with predecessor matthias platzeck , who resigned after suffering health problems he has consistently taken the side of two groups that make up the heart of the spd : people who are disadvantaged and hard laborers .
he 's one of the remaining few of a dying species of politicians who have worked as manual laborers before ascending their party 's career ladder . " i fear that in the future hardly anyone with my background will be able to make their way into leadership positions , " he has said . as an active trade union member , beck joined the spd in 1972 .
he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power . " i 've never had a feeling of power , " he said .
" during the time in which i 've been premier , since 1994 , i have had to swallow more than in the 46 years of my previous life .
you have to swallow a lot … when you 're the one to make the final decision in all questions . " last september , he already expressed confidence that he was prepared to take on the extra responsibilities that juggling his premiership and the leadership of the spd would require . " i have the strength and the capacity to make an important contribution on the berlin level , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd leader resigns after five months in office having served as social democratic party chairman for just five months , matthias platzeck will resign from his post .

" of course we want to be standing by the palestinian people and that means we will want to ... help them on the basic human needs , for instance water , electricity , food aid , education , " she said . germany endorsed the financing freeze , which should last at least one month , according to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . payment freeze expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and the foreign ministers will re-evaluate the halt at their next meeting in may " it is right we attach consequences to the fact the palestinian government is not responding to our expectations , " he said monday . europe , which classifies hamas as a terrorist organization , has repeatedly called for the hamas government to reject violence , recognize israel and state its commitment to past peace agreements . " such signs have unfortunately not come in recent weeks from palestinian government , " steinmeier said .
" so , they can not be surprised if we suspend financial aid . " the palestinian authority 's largest donor , the eu and its member states transfer some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to the palestinian government annually until last friday 's payment cut-off by the european commission . working out how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task , especially since the ministers could not agree on exactly what kinds of contacts to maintain with the palestinian government and people . eu rejects " blackmail " claims hamas 's prime minister ismail haniya has accused the eu and us , of trying to " blackmail " his government by cutting funds to a democratically elected government . " our future will not be decided by decisions in europe or in the rest of the world , " said yehya mussa , a hamas member of parliament .
" our people will not surrender and will not raise the white flag . " around a hundred palestinian youths took part in a protest in gaza city monday against the eu move , hurling eggs at the united nations headquarters from where local eu staff are currently working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal relations can return when the eu 's conditions are met , solana said british foreign secretary jack straw however defended the funding freeze , denying that the eu wanted to punish the palestinian people . " we do not wish to punish the palestinian people for the decision they freely made to elect a hamas-dominated government , " he said . " at the same time , hamas has got to recognize that being elected as a government , democratically , they have responsibilities as democrats to do what everybody else has to do as democrats , which is to eschew violence . " eu foreign policy chief javier solana echoed the comments , saying if hamas meets the three conditions , " we will deal with them normally . " " in any case we will do business as usual with the palestinian people , " he added .
" we will try to help them so that they do n't have to suffer any more than they have suffered already in the long years of occupation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and other minsk officials were banned from traveling in the eu travel ban for 31 belarus officials earlier in the day 's conference , the ministers confirmed a travel ban for recently re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko and 30 other government officials , after elections last month widely condemned as rigged . " we should impose that kind of measure in the future , " czech foreign minister cyril svoboda told reporters , stressing the importance of exerting permanent pressure on what some call the " europe 's last dictatorship . " there has been no official reaction from lukashenko , according to spokesman pavel lyogky . " probably there 's no point voicing some kind of position , " he told afp .
" it 's unlikely that any official will comment .
it 's not worth it .

but a group of young performers in the german capital have updated the classic to mark the composer 's 250th birthday . a male rapper flows to a dj 's beat in the gilded setting of a berlin opera house while a female singer launches into a mozart aria underlaid by the 18th-century tinkle of a harpsichord . welcome to " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop style , as staged at berlin 's renowned komische oper during europe 's year-long celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the composer 's birth . this performance of the beloved 1790 opera , accompanied by a high school orchestra , demonstrates mozart 's enduring power to attract audiences , and inspire new generations anxious to take his work to new places . the 21-year-old sil-yan bori , aka dj craft , works the turntables while the familiar opening notes swell from the orchestra pit as 40 street dancers mount the stage . they had eight months to create their own choreography on the central and eternal themes of " cosi fan tutte " : love , trust and infidelity . one of the dancers , 16-year-old judith scholl , said that before participating in the performance she " fell asleep every time " she went to the opera . the two young military officers , guglielmo -lrb- alias flowinimmo -rrb- and ferrando -lrb- alias bobmalo -rrb- , sport baggy jogging pants and rap the 200-year-old libretto in german . convinced that their girlfriends are true to them , they agree to a bet with their bachelor friend don alfonso who has his doubts about the loyalty of the female sex . pretending to have to leave them to head off to war , the pair reappear disguised as dashing foreigners ready to sweep the women off their feet .
but fiordiligi and dorabella , played by young singers , can not be swayed . classical themes still relevant in modern times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart probably did n't envisage a backdrop like this for his aria the set , looking like any berlin street , is sprayed with graffiti , the brandenburg gate is transformed into a giant ghetto blaster and the landmark television tower is mangled and dented . " cosi , this story about fidelity , happens everyday at school , " says another one of the dancers , deniz deli , a german of turkish origin . the performance gains resonance against the backdrop of increasing violence at berlin schools between arab , turkish and german teenagers which has dominated the headlines in recent weeks . mozart and hip-hop " made for each other " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wolfie m aka wolfgang amadeus mozart organizer markus kosuch said he initiated the show " for the love of mozart " and believes hip hop and opera were made for each other .
" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.04.2006 down-to-earth bridge-builder to lead social democrats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck started his career as an electrician kurt beck , state premier of rhineland-palatinate , is said to command respect beyond party lines .
that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party . kurt beck has never expressed the urge to take a greater role in national politics .
in november , when he had the chance to become head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , he stepped aside for matthias platzeck to take the job . it 's not that the 57-year old lacks ambition .
on the contrary , he worked his way up from being an electrician to premier of the western german state of rhineland-palatinate .
he is known for being down-to-earth and pursuing moderate social democratic policies .

that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party . kurt beck has never expressed the urge to take a greater role in national politics .
in november , when he had the chance to become head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , he stepped aside for matthias platzeck to take the job . it 's not that the 57-year old lacks ambition .
on the contrary , he worked his way up from being an electrician to premier of the western german state of rhineland-palatinate .
he is known for being down-to-earth and pursuing moderate social democratic policies .
he 's not one to experiment , instead introducing change with caution . as rhineland-palatinate premier for 11 years , beck has led the only coalition between the social democrats and the free market liberal free democrats .
his accomplishments and popularity have been such that in state-wide elections three weeks ago , the spd garnered an absolute majority which will allow beck to rule the state alone from mid-may .
old-school social democrat beck views communication as the key to his success .
he shows no reservations about meeting with industrialists or wine-growers .
he regularly makes himself available for meetings with his constituents in his hometown of steinfeld .
some say there 's not a hand in rhineland-palatinate he has n't shaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck with predecessor matthias platzeck , who resigned after suffering health problems he has consistently taken the side of two groups that make up the heart of the spd : people who are disadvantaged and hard laborers .
he 's one of the remaining few of a dying species of politicians who have worked as manual laborers before ascending their party 's career ladder . " i fear that in the future hardly anyone with my background will be able to make their way into leadership positions , " he has said . as an active trade union member , beck joined the spd in 1972 .
he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power . " i 've never had a feeling of power , " he said .
" during the time in which i 've been premier , since 1994 , i have had to swallow more than in the 46 years of my previous life .
you have to swallow a lot … when you 're the one to make the final decision in all questions . " last september , he already expressed confidence that he was prepared to take on the extra responsibilities that juggling his premiership and the leadership of the spd would require . " i have the strength and the capacity to make an important contribution on the berlin level , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd leader resigns after five months in office having served as social democratic party chairman for just five months , matthias platzeck will resign from his post .
he said health concerns , including a recent case of acute hearing loss , were behind the decision .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .

" we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .
bielefeld came out on top with heiko westermann scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and duisburg split three points both of them needed schalke tie , aiming toward uefa cup schalke drew 1-1 with bottom side msv duisburg on sunday to lose ground on the table leaders . danish international christian poulsen , set to leave the club in the summer , scored an own goal after 39 minutes as duisburg took a shock lead . soren larsen made amends for his compatriot 's error with an 85th minute equalizer but the point is not enough for schalke . " we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post . " we had so many chances but none of them went in , " said bayern 's french defender valerien ismael .

" integration is no one-way street , but should be seen as a mutual process , " the declaration said . in light of the recent the mohammed cartoon controversy , the imams underlined the importance of freedom of speech , while denouncing the violent protests as well as the media 's focus on violence in islam . " muslims are under pressure to justify themselves , as ... in the coverage of crises , images of aggression and violence , often outside europe , stand in the foreground , " the imams said . cemetery graffiti casts shadow over conference an attack on an islamic cemetery under construction in vienna reminded the imams of the hostility muslims meet throughout europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.04.2006 judgment day for berlusconi at the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts said prodi and berlusconi were neck-and-neck italians were delivering their verdict monday in the final hours of a two-day general election that could put an end to prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political career and hand power to his rival , romano prodi . prodi , who unseated berlusconi in the 1996 election , told afp he was " confident , very confident , " of maintaining his hex on the media magnate and pollsters said the expected high turnout could favor his center-left union bloc . the rival leaders were a study in contrasting moods on monday , as voting entered its second and final day . prodi , a 66-year-old former professor , coolly sipped coffee at a bar near rome 's tourist-thronged trevi fountain after returning to the capital by train from his home city of bologna in northern italy earlier monday . meanwhile , the normally voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , remained at his mansion in arcore , outside milan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

italians not voting for prodi but against berlusconi the votes on the first day of the italian elections look to be favoring center-left candidate romano prodi .
but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi .

opposition officials , though , had been more careful . " we 're still very cautious , but if these indications are confirmed , that would mean that italy had decided to turn the page and begin a new era , " said a spokesman at prodi 's headquarters . within hours , the vote projections had lurched in the prime minister 's favor .
berlusconi , italy 's richest man , returned to rome from his mansion in arcore , outside milan , in the afternoon , but refrained from making any comments . a nexus projection at 8 p.m. local time for italian state television showed berlusconi 's house of freedoms alliance would take the majority of seats in the race for the senate . majority needed in both houses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians had two days to vote based on the projection made with nearly nine-tenths of the votes counted , berlusconi 's house of freedoms would take 158 seats in the upper house senate against 152 for the union . that was followed by another projection showing berlusconi edging in front by 49.9 percent to 49.6 percent in the lower house chamber of deputies .
vote counting continued into the night . neither of the rival coalitions would be able to govern without a majority in both houses . " you ca n't say that the leftist union has a majority to govern , " said andrea ronchi of the national alliance , a key ally of berlusconi .
" we are neck and neck in the senate , and it 's a great result . " vote counting to continue throughout night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning took on nasty tones partial results announced earlier in the evening , based on a smaller sample of about one-sixth of the vote , gave 54.2 percent to prodi 's center-left and 45.2 percent to berlusconi 's house of freedoms in the lower house . at the time , senator paolo guzzanti of the prime minister 's forza italia party appeared to have given up hope . " our coalition has lost the elections , " he told afp .
" we expected something like this because we 've lost every -lrb- local -rrb- election since 2001 .

but a group of young performers in the german capital have updated the classic to mark the composer 's 250th birthday . a male rapper flows to a dj 's beat in the gilded setting of a berlin opera house while a female singer launches into a mozart aria underlaid by the 18th-century tinkle of a harpsichord . welcome to " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop style , as staged at berlin 's renowned komische oper during europe 's year-long celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the composer 's birth . this performance of the beloved 1790 opera , accompanied by a high school orchestra , demonstrates mozart 's enduring power to attract audiences , and inspire new generations anxious to take his work to new places . the 21-year-old sil-yan bori , aka dj craft , works the turntables while the familiar opening notes swell from the orchestra pit as 40 street dancers mount the stage . they had eight months to create their own choreography on the central and eternal themes of " cosi fan tutte " : love , trust and infidelity . one of the dancers , 16-year-old judith scholl , said that before participating in the performance she " fell asleep every time " she went to the opera . the two young military officers , guglielmo -lrb- alias flowinimmo -rrb- and ferrando -lrb- alias bobmalo -rrb- , sport baggy jogging pants and rap the 200-year-old libretto in german . convinced that their girlfriends are true to them , they agree to a bet with their bachelor friend don alfonso who has his doubts about the loyalty of the female sex . pretending to have to leave them to head off to war , the pair reappear disguised as dashing foreigners ready to sweep the women off their feet .
but fiordiligi and dorabella , played by young singers , can not be swayed . classical themes still relevant in modern times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart probably did n't envisage a backdrop like this for his aria the set , looking like any berlin street , is sprayed with graffiti , the brandenburg gate is transformed into a giant ghetto blaster and the landmark television tower is mangled and dented . " cosi , this story about fidelity , happens everyday at school , " says another one of the dancers , deniz deli , a german of turkish origin . the performance gains resonance against the backdrop of increasing violence at berlin schools between arab , turkish and german teenagers which has dominated the headlines in recent weeks . mozart and hip-hop " made for each other " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wolfie m aka wolfgang amadeus mozart organizer markus kosuch said he initiated the show " for the love of mozart " and believes hip hop and opera were made for each other .
" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .
bielefeld came out on top with heiko westermann scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and duisburg split three points both of them needed schalke tie , aiming toward uefa cup schalke drew 1-1 with bottom side msv duisburg on sunday to lose ground on the table leaders . danish international christian poulsen , set to leave the club in the summer , scored an own goal after 39 minutes as duisburg took a shock lead . soren larsen made amends for his compatriot 's error with an 85th minute equalizer but the point is not enough for schalke . " we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post . " we had so many chances but none of them went in , " said bayern 's french defender valerien ismael .
" bremen have the strikers to make you pay and they did that . " dw staff -lrb- nda / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?

but a group of young performers in the german capital have updated the classic to mark the composer 's 250th birthday . a male rapper flows to a dj 's beat in the gilded setting of a berlin opera house while a female singer launches into a mozart aria underlaid by the 18th-century tinkle of a harpsichord . welcome to " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop style , as staged at berlin 's renowned komische oper during europe 's year-long celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the composer 's birth . this performance of the beloved 1790 opera , accompanied by a high school orchestra , demonstrates mozart 's enduring power to attract audiences , and inspire new generations anxious to take his work to new places . the 21-year-old sil-yan bori , aka dj craft , works the turntables while the familiar opening notes swell from the orchestra pit as 40 street dancers mount the stage . they had eight months to create their own choreography on the central and eternal themes of " cosi fan tutte " : love , trust and infidelity . one of the dancers , 16-year-old judith scholl , said that before participating in the performance she " fell asleep every time " she went to the opera . the two young military officers , guglielmo -lrb- alias flowinimmo -rrb- and ferrando -lrb- alias bobmalo -rrb- , sport baggy jogging pants and rap the 200-year-old libretto in german . convinced that their girlfriends are true to them , they agree to a bet with their bachelor friend don alfonso who has his doubts about the loyalty of the female sex . pretending to have to leave them to head off to war , the pair reappear disguised as dashing foreigners ready to sweep the women off their feet .
but fiordiligi and dorabella , played by young singers , can not be swayed . classical themes still relevant in modern times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart probably did n't envisage a backdrop like this for his aria the set , looking like any berlin street , is sprayed with graffiti , the brandenburg gate is transformed into a giant ghetto blaster and the landmark television tower is mangled and dented . " cosi , this story about fidelity , happens everyday at school , " says another one of the dancers , deniz deli , a german of turkish origin . the performance gains resonance against the backdrop of increasing violence at berlin schools between arab , turkish and german teenagers which has dominated the headlines in recent weeks . mozart and hip-hop " made for each other " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wolfie m aka wolfgang amadeus mozart organizer markus kosuch said he initiated the show " for the love of mozart " and believes hip hop and opera were made for each other .
" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.04.2006 judgment day for berlusconi at the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts said prodi and berlusconi were neck-and-neck italians were delivering their verdict monday in the final hours of a two-day general election that could put an end to prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political career and hand power to his rival , romano prodi . prodi , who unseated berlusconi in the 1996 election , told afp he was " confident , very confident , " of maintaining his hex on the media magnate and pollsters said the expected high turnout could favor his center-left union bloc . the rival leaders were a study in contrasting moods on monday , as voting entered its second and final day . prodi , a 66-year-old former professor , coolly sipped coffee at a bar near rome 's tourist-thronged trevi fountain after returning to the capital by train from his home city of bologna in northern italy earlier monday . meanwhile , the normally voluble berlusconi , italy 's richest man , remained at his mansion in arcore , outside milan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

the posters are so popular that they keep disappearing . sand , blue skies , brown-skinned backsides - looks like a summer-in-the-sun vacation package .
but " maakt in oostfreesland " is n't a tourist ad for germany 's northwestern , island-studded region .
the campaign is aimed at youngsters " made in east frisia " to spark pride in their native language , the low-german dialect called plattdeutsch .
according to the organization oostfreeske taal , only around 20 to 25 percent of young east frisians speak low-german these days - about 50 percent still understand the language .
the initiative " made in east frisia " wants that to change . stah daarto .
mit dien sprak . east frisians are best known around germany for the jokes made at their expense .
these portray east frisians as mumbling country-bumpkins - germany 's greatest , next to their southern cousins , the bavarians .
perhaps it is because there are no big cities in the region , perhaps because until recently , the population consisted mostly of fishermen and farmers .
another reason could be that when east frisians speak their language , low-german , no one else in germany can understand them . oostfreeske tal has tried for over 15 years to raise the image of the east frisian low german , a language closely related to dutch .
speaking dialect , it says , is n't just good for regional tradition .
the organization focuses on modern , hipper aspects , like the benefits of bilingualism - speaking two foreign languages - as a cognitive boost for kids .
those who grow up speaking east frisian and high german are not backwards , it argues , but better equipped for a multi-lingual future - and qualified to get jobs in big cities far away from home .
show your pride in your heritage , the poster campaign reads .
with your language . heharrijasses ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned east frisia is not up for grabs but while the beaches and meadows are surely nice , it is the posters of tattooed bare booties that have caught the public eye .
they are being torn off school and university walls almost as soon as they go up , say the designers of " maakt in oostfreesland . "
if nothing else , a sure sign that the target audience thinks the campaign is cool . for those not close enough to get a good look , the campaign " made in east frisia " offers the tattoos on their web site as mobile phone logos , along with a series of language downloads .
save heharrijasses ! as a cry of despair to the almighty or the apathetic greeting koom rin , kannst rut kieken - " come on in , then you can look out . " or , if you want to get really east frisian , check out the saying wenn du en ei eten wullt , must du eerst in d ’ höhnerstall gahn .
liberally translated it means that if you want something done , you have to do it yourself .
however , it may also a reminder of the language 's rural roots .
literally speaking , it states that if you want to eat an egg , you first have to go to the chicken coop . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de welcome , party-poopers !

these portray east frisians as mumbling country-bumpkins - germany 's greatest , next to their southern cousins , the bavarians .
perhaps it is because there are no big cities in the region , perhaps because until recently , the population consisted mostly of fishermen and farmers .
another reason could be that when east frisians speak their language , low-german , no one else in germany can understand them . oostfreeske tal has tried for over 15 years to raise the image of the east frisian low german , a language closely related to dutch .
speaking dialect , it says , is n't just good for regional tradition .
the organization focuses on modern , hipper aspects , like the benefits of bilingualism - speaking two foreign languages - as a cognitive boost for kids .
those who grow up speaking east frisian and high german are not backwards , it argues , but better equipped for a multi-lingual future - and qualified to get jobs in big cities far away from home .
show your pride in your heritage , the poster campaign reads .
with your language . heharrijasses ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old-fashioned east frisia is not up for grabs but while the beaches and meadows are surely nice , it is the posters of tattooed bare booties that have caught the public eye .
they are being torn off school and university walls almost as soon as they go up , say the designers of " maakt in oostfreesland . "
if nothing else , a sure sign that the target audience thinks the campaign is cool . for those not close enough to get a good look , the campaign " made in east frisia " offers the tattoos on their web site as mobile phone logos , along with a series of language downloads .
save heharrijasses ! as a cry of despair to the almighty or the apathetic greeting koom rin , kannst rut kieken - " come on in , then you can look out . " or , if you want to get really east frisian , check out the saying wenn du en ei eten wullt , must du eerst in d ’ höhnerstall gahn .
liberally translated it means that if you want something done , you have to do it yourself .
however , it may also a reminder of the language 's rural roots .
literally speaking , it states that if you want to eat an egg , you first have to go to the chicken coop . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de welcome , party-poopers !

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .
bielefeld came out on top with heiko westermann scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and duisburg split three points both of them needed schalke tie , aiming toward uefa cup schalke drew 1-1 with bottom side msv duisburg on sunday to lose ground on the table leaders . danish international christian poulsen , set to leave the club in the summer , scored an own goal after 39 minutes as duisburg took a shock lead . soren larsen made amends for his compatriot 's error with an 85th minute equalizer but the point is not enough for schalke . " we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post . " we had so many chances but none of them went in , " said bayern 's french defender valerien ismael .

" it 's important for the team that i 'm present during the world cup , " the 36-year-old bayern munich star told a press conference .
" it 's not an easy situation .
of course , i was disappointed not to be chosen as first choice after working so hard .
but it 's more important that i give my support to the whole team so that we can achieve our objective - to be world champions . " kahn 's pledge of loyalty to the german squad was immediately welcomed by klinsmann . " my compliments to oliver , " klinsmann said .
" his experience and desire to put himself at the service of the team and to do everything he can to help us in the world cup is very important . " rising above rivalry germany 's general manager oliver bierhoff echoed klinsmann 's sentiments .
" oliver kahn has shown once again that he is a great sportsman , " bierhoff said .
" we hope now that we can continue our preparations for the world cup with some peace and quiet without constantly having to deal with this question of who is going to be in goal , " he added . klinsmann took the unusual step of announcing his support for lehmann on friday , ending a long-running guessing game over who would keep goal for germany at the world cup . " jürgen klinsmann has taken his decision , i 've accepted it , i 've thought about it and i 've decided to do what 's best for the team , " said kahn , adding that he has " no conflict " with his rival lehmann .
" we 've got to rise above talk of a rivalry between kahn and lehmann .
we need to be positive so we can achieve our goal , " said kahn , revealing he had received several messages of support from his international team-mates . " other members of the team and players from different clubs called me after the announcement and told me ' you have to be there , it 's important for the team ' , " kahn said . dw-world.de opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson .
-lrb- april 8 , 2006 -rrb- jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .
-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- what should king kahn do as germany 's no. 2 ?
for jürgen klinsmann picking jens lehmann as the starting goalie was the hardest choice of his time at coach of the national team .
german players are just happy a decision has been made .

" of course we want to be standing by the palestinian people and that means we will want to ... help them on the basic human needs , for instance water , electricity , food aid , education , " she said . germany endorsed the financing freeze , which should last at least one month , according to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . payment freeze expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and the foreign ministers will re-evaluate the halt at their next meeting in may " it is right we attach consequences to the fact the palestinian government is not responding to our expectations , " he said monday . europe , which classifies hamas as a terrorist organization , has repeatedly called for the hamas government to reject violence , recognize israel and state its commitment to past peace agreements . " such signs have unfortunately not come in recent weeks from palestinian government , " steinmeier said .
" so , they can not be surprised if we suspend financial aid . " the palestinian authority 's largest donor , the eu and its member states transfer some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to the palestinian government annually until last friday 's payment cut-off by the european commission . working out how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task , especially since the ministers could not agree on exactly what kinds of contacts to maintain with the palestinian government and people . eu rejects " blackmail " claims hamas 's prime minister ismail haniya has accused the eu and us , of trying to " blackmail " his government by cutting funds to a democratically elected government . " our future will not be decided by decisions in europe or in the rest of the world , " said yehya mussa , a hamas member of parliament .
" our people will not surrender and will not raise the white flag . " around a hundred palestinian youths took part in a protest in gaza city monday against the eu move , hurling eggs at the united nations headquarters from where local eu staff are currently working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal relations can return when the eu 's conditions are met , solana said british foreign secretary jack straw however defended the funding freeze , denying that the eu wanted to punish the palestinian people . " we do not wish to punish the palestinian people for the decision they freely made to elect a hamas-dominated government , " he said . " at the same time , hamas has got to recognize that being elected as a government , democratically , they have responsibilities as democrats to do what everybody else has to do as democrats , which is to eschew violence . " eu foreign policy chief javier solana echoed the comments , saying if hamas meets the three conditions , " we will deal with them normally .

the campaign is aimed at youngsters " made in east frisia " to spark pride in their native language , the low-german dialect called plattdeutsch .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

the posters are so popular that they keep disappearing . sand , blue skies , brown-skinned backsides - looks like a summer-in-the-sun vacation package .
but " maakt in oostfreesland " is n't a tourist ad for germany 's northwestern , island-studded region .
the campaign is aimed at youngsters " made in east frisia " to spark pride in their native language , the low-german dialect called plattdeutsch .

these portray east frisians as mumbling country-bumpkins - germany 's greatest , next to their southern cousins , the bavarians .

another reason could be that when east frisians speak their language , low-german , no one else in germany can understand them . oostfreeske tal has tried for over 15 years to raise the image of the east frisian low german , a language closely related to dutch .
speaking dialect , it says , is n't just good for regional tradition .
the organization focuses on modern , hipper aspects , like the benefits of bilingualism - speaking two foreign languages - as a cognitive boost for kids .
those who grow up speaking east frisian and high german are not backwards , it argues , but better equipped for a multi-lingual future - and qualified to get jobs in big cities far away from home .

that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party . kurt beck has never expressed the urge to take a greater role in national politics .
in november , when he had the chance to become head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , he stepped aside for matthias platzeck to take the job . it 's not that the 57-year old lacks ambition .
on the contrary , he worked his way up from being an electrician to premier of the western german state of rhineland-palatinate .
he is known for being down-to-earth and pursuing moderate social democratic policies .
he 's not one to experiment , instead introducing change with caution . as rhineland-palatinate premier for 11 years , beck has led the only coalition between the social democrats and the free market liberal free democrats .
his accomplishments and popularity have been such that in state-wide elections three weeks ago , the spd garnered an absolute majority which will allow beck to rule the state alone from mid-may .
old-school social democrat beck views communication as the key to his success .
he shows no reservations about meeting with industrialists or wine-growers .
he regularly makes himself available for meetings with his constituents in his hometown of steinfeld .
some say there 's not a hand in rhineland-palatinate he has n't shaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck with predecessor matthias platzeck , who resigned after suffering health problems he has consistently taken the side of two groups that make up the heart of the spd : people who are disadvantaged and hard laborers .
he 's one of the remaining few of a dying species of politicians who have worked as manual laborers before ascending their party 's career ladder . " i fear that in the future hardly anyone with my background will be able to make their way into leadership positions , " he has said . as an active trade union member , beck joined the spd in 1972 .
he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power . " i 've never had a feeling of power , " he said .
" during the time in which i 've been premier , since 1994 , i have had to swallow more than in the 46 years of my previous life .
you have to swallow a lot … when you 're the one to make the final decision in all questions . " last september , he already expressed confidence that he was prepared to take on the extra responsibilities that juggling his premiership and the leadership of the spd would require .

" it 's important for the team that i 'm present during the world cup , " the 36-year-old bayern munich star told a press conference .
" it 's not an easy situation .
of course , i was disappointed not to be chosen as first choice after working so hard .
but it 's more important that i give my support to the whole team so that we can achieve our objective - to be world champions . " kahn 's pledge of loyalty to the german squad was immediately welcomed by klinsmann . " my compliments to oliver , " klinsmann said .
" his experience and desire to put himself at the service of the team and to do everything he can to help us in the world cup is very important . " rising above rivalry germany 's general manager oliver bierhoff echoed klinsmann 's sentiments .
" oliver kahn has shown once again that he is a great sportsman , " bierhoff said .
" we hope now that we can continue our preparations for the world cup with some peace and quiet without constantly having to deal with this question of who is going to be in goal , " he added . klinsmann took the unusual step of announcing his support for lehmann on friday , ending a long-running guessing game over who would keep goal for germany at the world cup . " jürgen klinsmann has taken his decision , i 've accepted it , i 've thought about it and i 've decided to do what 's best for the team , " said kahn , adding that he has " no conflict " with his rival lehmann .
" we 've got to rise above talk of a rivalry between kahn and lehmann .
we need to be positive so we can achieve our goal , " said kahn , revealing he had received several messages of support from his international team-mates . " other members of the team and players from different clubs called me after the announcement and told me ' you have to be there , it 's important for the team ' , " kahn said . dw-world.de opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson .
-lrb- april 8 , 2006 -rrb- jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

" of course we want to be standing by the palestinian people and that means we will want to ... help them on the basic human needs , for instance water , electricity , food aid , education , " she said . germany endorsed the financing freeze , which should last at least one month , according to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . payment freeze expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and the foreign ministers will re-evaluate the halt at their next meeting in may " it is right we attach consequences to the fact the palestinian government is not responding to our expectations , " he said monday . europe , which classifies hamas as a terrorist organization , has repeatedly called for the hamas government to reject violence , recognize israel and state its commitment to past peace agreements . " such signs have unfortunately not come in recent weeks from palestinian government , " steinmeier said .
" so , they can not be surprised if we suspend financial aid . " the palestinian authority 's largest donor , the eu and its member states transfer some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to the palestinian government annually until last friday 's payment cut-off by the european commission . working out how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task , especially since the ministers could not agree on exactly what kinds of contacts to maintain with the palestinian government and people . eu rejects " blackmail " claims hamas 's prime minister ismail haniya has accused the eu and us , of trying to " blackmail " his government by cutting funds to a democratically elected government . " our future will not be decided by decisions in europe or in the rest of the world , " said yehya mussa , a hamas member of parliament .
" our people will not surrender and will not raise the white flag . " around a hundred palestinian youths took part in a protest in gaza city monday against the eu move , hurling eggs at the united nations headquarters from where local eu staff are currently working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal relations can return when the eu 's conditions are met , solana said british foreign secretary jack straw however defended the funding freeze , denying that the eu wanted to punish the palestinian people . " we do not wish to punish the palestinian people for the decision they freely made to elect a hamas-dominated government , " he said . " at the same time , hamas has got to recognize that being elected as a government , democratically , they have responsibilities as democrats to do what everybody else has to do as democrats , which is to eschew violence . " eu foreign policy chief javier solana echoed the comments , saying if hamas meets the three conditions , " we will deal with them normally . " " in any case we will do business as usual with the palestinian people , " he added .
" we will try to help them so that they do n't have to suffer any more than they have suffered already in the long years of occupation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and other minsk officials were banned from traveling in the eu travel ban for 31 belarus officials earlier in the day 's conference , the ministers confirmed a travel ban for recently re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko and 30 other government officials , after elections last month widely condemned as rigged . " we should impose that kind of measure in the future , " czech foreign minister cyril svoboda told reporters , stressing the importance of exerting permanent pressure on what some call the " europe 's last dictatorship . " there has been no official reaction from lukashenko , according to spokesman pavel lyogky . " probably there 's no point voicing some kind of position , " he told afp .

but a group of young performers in the german capital have updated the classic to mark the composer 's 250th birthday . a male rapper flows to a dj 's beat in the gilded setting of a berlin opera house while a female singer launches into a mozart aria underlaid by the 18th-century tinkle of a harpsichord . welcome to " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop style , as staged at berlin 's renowned komische oper during europe 's year-long celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the composer 's birth . this performance of the beloved 1790 opera , accompanied by a high school orchestra , demonstrates mozart 's enduring power to attract audiences , and inspire new generations anxious to take his work to new places . the 21-year-old sil-yan bori , aka dj craft , works the turntables while the familiar opening notes swell from the orchestra pit as 40 street dancers mount the stage . they had eight months to create their own choreography on the central and eternal themes of " cosi fan tutte " : love , trust and infidelity . one of the dancers , 16-year-old judith scholl , said that before participating in the performance she " fell asleep every time " she went to the opera . the two young military officers , guglielmo -lrb- alias flowinimmo -rrb- and ferrando -lrb- alias bobmalo -rrb- , sport baggy jogging pants and rap the 200-year-old libretto in german . convinced that their girlfriends are true to them , they agree to a bet with their bachelor friend don alfonso who has his doubts about the loyalty of the female sex . pretending to have to leave them to head off to war , the pair reappear disguised as dashing foreigners ready to sweep the women off their feet .
but fiordiligi and dorabella , played by young singers , can not be swayed . classical themes still relevant in modern times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart probably did n't envisage a backdrop like this for his aria the set , looking like any berlin street , is sprayed with graffiti , the brandenburg gate is transformed into a giant ghetto blaster and the landmark television tower is mangled and dented . " cosi , this story about fidelity , happens everyday at school , " says another one of the dancers , deniz deli , a german of turkish origin . the performance gains resonance against the backdrop of increasing violence at berlin schools between arab , turkish and german teenagers which has dominated the headlines in recent weeks . mozart and hip-hop " made for each other " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wolfie m aka wolfgang amadeus mozart organizer markus kosuch said he initiated the show " for the love of mozart " and believes hip hop and opera were made for each other .
" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

old-school social democrat beck views communication as the key to his success .
he shows no reservations about meeting with industrialists or wine-growers .
he regularly makes himself available for meetings with his constituents in his hometown of steinfeld .
some say there 's not a hand in rhineland-palatinate he has n't shaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck with predecessor matthias platzeck , who resigned after suffering health problems he has consistently taken the side of two groups that make up the heart of the spd : people who are disadvantaged and hard laborers .
he 's one of the remaining few of a dying species of politicians who have worked as manual laborers before ascending their party 's career ladder . " i fear that in the future hardly anyone with my background will be able to make their way into leadership positions , " he has said . as an active trade union member , beck joined the spd in 1972 .
he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power . " i 've never had a feeling of power , " he said .
" during the time in which i 've been premier , since 1994 , i have had to swallow more than in the 46 years of my previous life .
you have to swallow a lot … when you 're the one to make the final decision in all questions . " last september , he already expressed confidence that he was prepared to take on the extra responsibilities that juggling his premiership and the leadership of the spd would require . " i have the strength and the capacity to make an important contribution on the berlin level , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd leader resigns after five months in office having served as social democratic party chairman for just five months , matthias platzeck will resign from his post .
he said health concerns , including a recent case of acute hearing loss , were behind the decision .
-lrb- april 10 , 2006 -rrb- german state elections keep premiers in place conservatives and social democrats held on to power in three german state polls sunday , signaling good news for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition .

that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party . kurt beck has never expressed the urge to take a greater role in national politics .
in november , when he had the chance to become head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , he stepped aside for matthias platzeck to take the job . it 's not that the 57-year old lacks ambition .
on the contrary , he worked his way up from being an electrician to premier of the western german state of rhineland-palatinate .
he is known for being down-to-earth and pursuing moderate social democratic policies .
he 's not one to experiment , instead introducing change with caution . as rhineland-palatinate premier for 11 years , beck has led the only coalition between the social democrats and the free market liberal free democrats .
his accomplishments and popularity have been such that in state-wide elections three weeks ago , the spd garnered an absolute majority which will allow beck to rule the state alone from mid-may .
old-school social democrat beck views communication as the key to his success .
he shows no reservations about meeting with industrialists or wine-growers .
he regularly makes himself available for meetings with his constituents in his hometown of steinfeld .
some say there 's not a hand in rhineland-palatinate he has n't shaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck with predecessor matthias platzeck , who resigned after suffering health problems he has consistently taken the side of two groups that make up the heart of the spd : people who are disadvantaged and hard laborers .
he 's one of the remaining few of a dying species of politicians who have worked as manual laborers before ascending their party 's career ladder . " i fear that in the future hardly anyone with my background will be able to make their way into leadership positions , " he has said . as an active trade union member , beck joined the spd in 1972 .
he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power . " i 've never had a feeling of power , " he said .
" during the time in which i 've been premier , since 1994 , i have had to swallow more than in the 46 years of my previous life .
you have to swallow a lot … when you 're the one to make the final decision in all questions . " last september , he already expressed confidence that he was prepared to take on the extra responsibilities that juggling his premiership and the leadership of the spd would require . " i have the strength and the capacity to make an important contribution on the berlin level , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd leader resigns after five months in office having served as social democratic party chairman for just five months , matthias platzeck will resign from his post .
he said health concerns , including a recent case of acute hearing loss , were behind the decision .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .

" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

" muslims are under pressure to justify themselves , as ... in the coverage of crises , images of aggression and violence , often outside europe , stand in the foreground , " the imams said . cemetery graffiti casts shadow over conference an attack on an islamic cemetery under construction in vienna reminded the imams of the hostility muslims meet throughout europe .

that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party . kurt beck has never expressed the urge to take a greater role in national politics .
in november , when he had the chance to become head of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , he stepped aside for matthias platzeck to take the job . it 's not that the 57-year old lacks ambition .
on the contrary , he worked his way up from being an electrician to premier of the western german state of rhineland-palatinate .
he is known for being down-to-earth and pursuing moderate social democratic policies .
he 's not one to experiment , instead introducing change with caution . as rhineland-palatinate premier for 11 years , beck has led the only coalition between the social democrats and the free market liberal free democrats .
his accomplishments and popularity have been such that in state-wide elections three weeks ago , the spd garnered an absolute majority which will allow beck to rule the state alone from mid-may .
old-school social democrat beck views communication as the key to his success .
he shows no reservations about meeting with industrialists or wine-growers .
he regularly makes himself available for meetings with his constituents in his hometown of steinfeld .
some say there 's not a hand in rhineland-palatinate he has n't shaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck with predecessor matthias platzeck , who resigned after suffering health problems he has consistently taken the side of two groups that make up the heart of the spd : people who are disadvantaged and hard laborers .
he 's one of the remaining few of a dying species of politicians who have worked as manual laborers before ascending their party 's career ladder . " i fear that in the future hardly anyone with my background will be able to make their way into leadership positions , " he has said . as an active trade union member , beck joined the spd in 1972 .
he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power . " i 've never had a feeling of power , " he said .
" during the time in which i 've been premier , since 1994 , i have had to swallow more than in the 46 years of my previous life .
you have to swallow a lot … when you 're the one to make the final decision in all questions . " last september , he already expressed confidence that he was prepared to take on the extra responsibilities that juggling his premiership and the leadership of the spd would require . " i have the strength and the capacity to make an important contribution on the berlin level , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd leader resigns after five months in office having served as social democratic party chairman for just five months , matthias platzeck will resign from his post .
he said health concerns , including a recent case of acute hearing loss , were behind the decision .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's mother accompanied him to the polls in milan on sunday much attention will focus on the outcome of the poll in berlusconi 's home city .
the center-right 's share of the vote has dwindled steadily in the northern business capital , and only 12,000 votes separated left and right in local elections in 2005 .
exit polls in afternoon " it 's neck-and-neck , " said milan-based political analyst john foot .
" berlusconi has always been intimately linked with milan .
he constructed it and has been constructed by it , " foot told afp .
" lose milan and he loses italy . " pollsters forecast a high turnout by the close of voting at 3:00 pm monday , after more than two-thirds of the electorate , 66.5 percent , cast their ballots on sunday .
analysts say a high turnout could favor prodi 's center-left union bloc , a multihued group including communists as well as catholics and liberals , which held a narrow opinion poll lead coming into the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi voted at home in bologna on sunday exit polls were expected to deliver an unofficial verdict in the afternoon , with first official results expected by evening . if the margin of victory for either side is narrow , both parties fear a split parliament with power divided between the chamber of deputies and the senate , leading to the nightmare scenario of legislative paralysis .
to win a mandate to govern , a coalition must win control of both houses . high turnout analysts said the center-left was boosted by a large turnout , with two out of three italians voting by the close of polling on sunday night . " there are those who support the idea that a bigger turnout would give the center-left an advantage , given that this bloc certainly comprises more militant voters , " said pollster renato mannheimer in the daily corriere della sera .
" that seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the traditionally left regions the turnout has been higher than in the last election , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning was fierce but other analysts say a high turnout would instead favor the center-right in traditionally conservative italy and point to a low turnout in the communist-controlled region of puglia . italian media reported that the union 's headquarters have been inundated with requests for accreditations for journalists , while the right-wing national alliance led by deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has refused any such requests . umberto bossi , leader of the anti-immigration northern league and a staunch ally of berlusconi , said that if the center-left won the election " i 'm taking off to switzerland .

italians not voting for prodi but against berlusconi the votes on the first day of the italian elections look to be favoring center-left candidate romano prodi .
but voters seem to be voting against silvio berlusconi rather than for prodi .

this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?

" of course we want to be standing by the palestinian people and that means we will want to ... help them on the basic human needs , for instance water , electricity , food aid , education , " she said . germany endorsed the financing freeze , which should last at least one month , according to foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . payment freeze expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and the foreign ministers will re-evaluate the halt at their next meeting in may " it is right we attach consequences to the fact the palestinian government is not responding to our expectations , " he said monday . europe , which classifies hamas as a terrorist organization , has repeatedly called for the hamas government to reject violence , recognize israel and state its commitment to past peace agreements . " such signs have unfortunately not come in recent weeks from palestinian government , " steinmeier said .
" so , they can not be surprised if we suspend financial aid . " the palestinian authority 's largest donor , the eu and its member states transfer some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to the palestinian government annually until last friday 's payment cut-off by the european commission . working out how to prevent any cash getting into hamas-controlled hands is a complex task , especially since the ministers could not agree on exactly what kinds of contacts to maintain with the palestinian government and people . eu rejects " blackmail " claims hamas 's prime minister ismail haniya has accused the eu and us , of trying to " blackmail " his government by cutting funds to a democratically elected government . " our future will not be decided by decisions in europe or in the rest of the world , " said yehya mussa , a hamas member of parliament .
" our people will not surrender and will not raise the white flag . " around a hundred palestinian youths took part in a protest in gaza city monday against the eu move , hurling eggs at the united nations headquarters from where local eu staff are currently working . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal relations can return when the eu 's conditions are met , solana said british foreign secretary jack straw however defended the funding freeze , denying that the eu wanted to punish the palestinian people . " we do not wish to punish the palestinian people for the decision they freely made to elect a hamas-dominated government , " he said . " at the same time , hamas has got to recognize that being elected as a government , democratically , they have responsibilities as democrats to do what everybody else has to do as democrats , which is to eschew violence . " eu foreign policy chief javier solana echoed the comments , saying if hamas meets the three conditions , " we will deal with them normally . " " in any case we will do business as usual with the palestinian people , " he added .
" we will try to help them so that they do n't have to suffer any more than they have suffered already in the long years of occupation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko and other minsk officials were banned from traveling in the eu travel ban for 31 belarus officials earlier in the day 's conference , the ministers confirmed a travel ban for recently re-elected belarus president alexander lukashenko and 30 other government officials , after elections last month widely condemned as rigged . " we should impose that kind of measure in the future , " czech foreign minister cyril svoboda told reporters , stressing the importance of exerting permanent pressure on what some call the " europe 's last dictatorship . " there has been no official reaction from lukashenko , according to spokesman pavel lyogky . " probably there 's no point voicing some kind of position , " he told afp .
" it 's unlikely that any official will comment .

he was voted into rhineland-palatinate 's state parliament in 1979 and became spd parliamentary group leader in 1991 .
he assumed the premiership of the state when his spd colleague rudolf scharping vacated the position in 1994 . not in it for power beck made a name for himself in the state by expanding school hours from half to full days and helping the state adjust to the closure of us bases there .
but the state has also accumulated huge debts , which it is beck 's priority to pay off . though it cost the state a lot of money , the passionate soccer fan fought hard to ensure that this summer 's world cup matches would also take place in kaiserslautern where beck 's eponymous team comes from . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern has been celebrating being named a location for the world cup though beck has shown tenacity , he does n't see himself as someone who craves power .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .
bielefeld came out on top with heiko westermann scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and duisburg split three points both of them needed schalke tie , aiming toward uefa cup schalke drew 1-1 with bottom side msv duisburg on sunday to lose ground on the table leaders . danish international christian poulsen , set to leave the club in the summer , scored an own goal after 39 minutes as duisburg took a shock lead . soren larsen made amends for his compatriot 's error with an 85th minute equalizer but the point is not enough for schalke . " we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post .

" integration is no one-way street , but should be seen as a mutual process , " the declaration said . in light of the recent the mohammed cartoon controversy , the imams underlined the importance of freedom of speech , while denouncing the violent protests as well as the media 's focus on violence in islam . " muslims are under pressure to justify themselves , as ... in the coverage of crises , images of aggression and violence , often outside europe , stand in the foreground , " the imams said . cemetery graffiti casts shadow over conference an attack on an islamic cemetery under construction in vienna reminded the imams of the hostility muslims meet throughout europe .

he had hoped to ease the pain by helping bayern edge closer to a 20th german title by winning at bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans show their goalie where he rates in their hearts but the 36-year-old kahn was helpless as bastian schweinsteiger scored an awful own goal to put bremen in front on 33 minutes . it was great to win , particularly against bayern , " said bremen and germany striker miroslav klose .
" hopefully this gives us a push now until the end of the season . " danish international daniel jensen and tim borowski sealed the game late on to pile another dose of misery on kahn . " oliver was very concentrated after the decision was made , " explained bayern coach felix magath .
" he played well just like he said he would . " bayern need just 11 points to defend the title but they are stumbling with the finishing line in sight .
there are five games left in the bundesliga season . " we are still top and have a lead so it is in our hands , " added magath .
" i thought we were good today but just did not have any luck .
we just have to focus on our next match as we have the chance to reach the cup final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez slips past kasey keller bremen and hamburg turn heat up on faltering champs hamburg are just concentrating on securing second and an automatic champions league berth , and a 2-0 win over mönchengladbach helped their cause . a penalty from netherlands international forward rafael van der vaart put hamburg ahead at the aol-arena on 34 minutes . mönchengladbach stayed in the match until japanese international striker naohiro takahara struck late on to clinch the points .
hamburg now look guaranteed one of the three champions league spots with fourth-placed schalke 04 nine points behind . " getting back second place was the most important thing , " said hamburg coach doll .
" we are in good form at the moment and everything seems to be going our way . " bayern will try to turn their slide around against regional side fc sankt pauli in the german cup semi-final on wednesday .
the other semi-final pairing on tuesday is between eintracht frankfurt and arminia bielefeld .
the two had a dress rehearsal in the league .
bielefeld came out on top with heiko westermann scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke and duisburg split three points both of them needed schalke tie , aiming toward uefa cup schalke drew 1-1 with bottom side msv duisburg on sunday to lose ground on the table leaders . danish international christian poulsen , set to leave the club in the summer , scored an own goal after 39 minutes as duisburg took a shock lead . soren larsen made amends for his compatriot 's error with an 85th minute equalizer but the point is not enough for schalke . " we lost too many challenges so we have to be content with the point , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" i am still optimistic but it is becoming more difficult for us . " schalke have managed to reach the semi-finals of the uefa cup this season and it looks like they will be playing in that competition next season . for duisburg , without a manager after sacking their coach jürgen kohler last week , the german second division beckons with the club six points from safety . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-form klose rejoices in beating an old foe klose masterclass timed to perfection as klinsi looks on germany manager jürgen klinsmann stirred up a hornets ' nest on friday when he revealed that kahn was no longer first choice for the germany team and bayern chiefs were furious at the timing of the revelation with the bremen match 24 hours later . klinsmann watched the game from the stands with seven german internationals on show . bremen forward klose , one of klinsmann 's stars , enjoyed a great afternoon and brilliantly cut the ball back from the touchline to set up bremen 's opener . klose 's chipped cross wreaked havoc and bayern 's german international schweinsteiger tried to clear the danger but his powerful header went into his own net . kahn , who had earlier pulled off a magnificent save to thwart nelson haedo valdez , could only pick the ball out of the net . bayern should have equalized but spurned a series of guilt-edged chances with schweinsteiger going close and michael ballack hitting the post .

but a group of young performers in the german capital have updated the classic to mark the composer 's 250th birthday . a male rapper flows to a dj 's beat in the gilded setting of a berlin opera house while a female singer launches into a mozart aria underlaid by the 18th-century tinkle of a harpsichord . welcome to " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop style , as staged at berlin 's renowned komische oper during europe 's year-long celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the composer 's birth . this performance of the beloved 1790 opera , accompanied by a high school orchestra , demonstrates mozart 's enduring power to attract audiences , and inspire new generations anxious to take his work to new places . the 21-year-old sil-yan bori , aka dj craft , works the turntables while the familiar opening notes swell from the orchestra pit as 40 street dancers mount the stage . they had eight months to create their own choreography on the central and eternal themes of " cosi fan tutte " : love , trust and infidelity . one of the dancers , 16-year-old judith scholl , said that before participating in the performance she " fell asleep every time " she went to the opera . the two young military officers , guglielmo -lrb- alias flowinimmo -rrb- and ferrando -lrb- alias bobmalo -rrb- , sport baggy jogging pants and rap the 200-year-old libretto in german . convinced that their girlfriends are true to them , they agree to a bet with their bachelor friend don alfonso who has his doubts about the loyalty of the female sex . pretending to have to leave them to head off to war , the pair reappear disguised as dashing foreigners ready to sweep the women off their feet .
but fiordiligi and dorabella , played by young singers , can not be swayed . classical themes still relevant in modern times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart probably did n't envisage a backdrop like this for his aria the set , looking like any berlin street , is sprayed with graffiti , the brandenburg gate is transformed into a giant ghetto blaster and the landmark television tower is mangled and dented . " cosi , this story about fidelity , happens everyday at school , " says another one of the dancers , deniz deli , a german of turkish origin . the performance gains resonance against the backdrop of increasing violence at berlin schools between arab , turkish and german teenagers which has dominated the headlines in recent weeks . mozart and hip-hop " made for each other " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mc wolfie m aka wolfgang amadeus mozart organizer markus kosuch said he initiated the show " for the love of mozart " and believes hip hop and opera were made for each other .
" respect is one of the most important aspects of hip hop .
i take a step toward you , you take a step toward me , " he said . the two rappers said they did not have to make many changes to the libretto , particularly when it comes to the sweet-talking seduction of fiordiligi and dorabella . " girls should not always play so hard to get but should just throw themselves into life and see what happens , " said one of the dancers , kira-signi hass , giving her take on the opera 's message .
" and the guys should not act like they can get all the girls in bed . " the team has its own ideas about infidelity and the sexes that mark a break with those of mozart , a legendary womanizer . the moral of this hip-hop opera according to the cast is not " cosi fan tutte " , which translates in italian as all women are like that , but " cosi fan tutti " : everyone is like that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : uncommon genius for the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .

churches say a new seven days a week ferry service across the sound of harris tramples over their faith , and they do n't want it .
but others in the western isles argue that they should be able to travel wherever and whenever they want .
the bbc 's huw williams reports from the outer hebrides .
rumours travel fast in island communities .
someone told me there had been a big demand from south harris for posters promoting the sabbath .
so , since a nod is as good as a wink , i was out at 10 o 'clock on saturday night , looking for people putting them up along the road to leverburgh harbour .
once or twice i thought i was on to them , but eventually i gave up and went back to the bed and breakfast to sleep .
early on sunday morning , once i 'd scraped thick unseasonal snow off the car and eaten a hearty cooked breakfast , i was back at the harbour .
and , sure enough , there they were .
bright yellow posters , urging anyone driving to or from the ferry slipway to " remember the sabbath day " .
and at the slipway itself , tapes strung across the road - like police scenes of crime tape .
again bright yellow , with the warning " caution keep out " .
no disruptions someone had been out in the dead of night , putting out these silent rebukes .
they must have been from the island 's churches .
they must have done it after i went to bed .
and they must have done it before midnight , because the whole point of the campaign against seven days a week ferry sailings is that sunday is supposed to be a day of quiet and rest .
no work , only worship .
but any thoughts that the snow might stop the ferry from sailing were soon proved wrong .
the caledonian macbrayne service line reported " no disruptions " on the berneray to leverburgh route .
just before 10 o 'clock on sunday morning a little piece of hebridean history was made .
the loch portain eased its way up to the slipway , lowered its ramp , and a few cars and slightly more foot passengers arrived in harris on sunday .
and not just any old sunday .
the free presbyterian church that overlooks leverburgh harbour was celebrating one of its six-monthly communions .
that added insult to injury .
" given that the people travelling on that ferry must have a certain anti-christian sabbath mentality " , the reverend andrew coghill told me , " it 's really the equivalent of driving a convoy of bnp supporters past a mosque in the middle of ramadan . "
that , he said , would never be allowed to happen .
mr coghill speaks for the lord 's day observance society .
" as a christian organisation we would say we were born again , " he added .
" but we certainly were n't born yesterday ... if we had been any other religious minority the government would be moving heaven and earth to make sure that our religious sensitivities were n't trampled over . "
day of rest but he , and others on his side of the debate , are quite happy to spin the discussion , in an attempt to engage with people who do n't necessarily take the bible as the final authority .
councillor morag munro lives just outside leverburgh .
on her croft , she told me she thought anyone would appreciate having a day set aside as a special day of rest .
" would you not like to have one special day which you can share with your family and friends , when you can put off the pressures of work , the stress and the targets ? " she asked . "
rather than us following the rest of the country , the rest of the country should follow us " councillor morag munro " do you not think that would be a good thing for the health of the nation ? "
other people talked about the fear that sunday sailings might damage - rather than enhance - the islands ' tourism industry .
if they become more like mainland scotland , the argument runs , then the visitors might not come any more .
when sunday flights into stornoway airport started , some of the christian protestors were happy to speak about them as a form of " cultural imperialism " .
and the same theme was echoed this time round .
there 's bemusement - why ca n't lewis and harris be allowed to be different from the rest of scotland , the rest of the uk , if they want to be ?
and there 's no acceptance that the issue of sabbath observance is a lost cause .
" what i would like to promote " , cllr munro told me , " is that rather than us following the rest of the country , the rest of the country should follow us . "
the ferry company , calmac , chose not to comment on the rights and wrongs of the protest .
on the quayside at leverburgh , once the tapes had been cut to allow cars to move freely onto and off the boat , company spokesman hugh dan maclennan told me that people had the right to make their point of view known .
but , he said , the company was responding to public demand .
this , he said , is a life-line service , and people want to be able to travel up and down the whole of the western isles whenever they need to .
every generalisation about this story is probably wrong .
it 's not about church people versus non-church people .
there are plenty of non-christians who appreciate the unique sunday you get in the hebrides .
but i suspect there are also some christians who would n't be quite so hard-line on this issue as their leaders are .
wait and watch and it 's not even about lewis and harris versus berneray and the uists .
even if there 's more public support for the sunday sailings the further south you go , there are people on both sides of the argument on both sides of the sound of harris .
we 'll all have to wait , and watch , and see whether the islands change irrevocably now that sunday sailings have started .
but if they do , one young free church member told me , it 'll be too late .
she said she feared that many who were happy to see traditional sundays disappear would only realise how much they missed them after they 'd gone .
but then , she said , it would be too late .

churches say a new seven days a week ferry service across the sound of harris tramples over their faith , and they do n't want it .
but others in the western isles argue that they should be able to travel wherever and whenever they want .
the bbc 's huw williams reports from the outer hebrides .
rumours travel fast in island communities .
someone told me there had been a big demand from south harris for posters promoting the sabbath .
so , since a nod is as good as a wink , i was out at 10 o 'clock on saturday night , looking for people putting them up along the road to leverburgh harbour .
once or twice i thought i was on to them , but eventually i gave up and went back to the bed and breakfast to sleep .
early on sunday morning , once i 'd scraped thick unseasonal snow off the car and eaten a hearty cooked breakfast , i was back at the harbour .
and , sure enough , there they were .
bright yellow posters , urging anyone driving to or from the ferry slipway to " remember the sabbath day " .
and at the slipway itself , tapes strung across the road - like police scenes of crime tape .
again bright yellow , with the warning " caution keep out " .
no disruptions someone had been out in the dead of night , putting out these silent rebukes .
they must have been from the island 's churches .
they must have done it after i went to bed .
and they must have done it before midnight , because the whole point of the campaign against seven days a week ferry sailings is that sunday is supposed to be a day of quiet and rest .
no work , only worship .
but any thoughts that the snow might stop the ferry from sailing were soon proved wrong .
the caledonian macbrayne service line reported " no disruptions " on the berneray to leverburgh route .
the service links berneray and leverburgh just before 10 o 'clock on sunday morning a little piece of hebridean history was made .
the loch portain eased its way up to the slipway , lowered its ramp , and a few cars and slightly more foot passengers arrived in harris on sunday .
and not just any old sunday .
the free presbyterian church that overlooks leverburgh harbour was celebrating one of its six-monthly communions .
that added insult to injury .
" given that the people travelling on that ferry must have a certain anti-christian sabbath mentality " , the reverend andrew coghill told me , " it 's really the equivalent of driving a convoy of bnp supporters past a mosque in the middle of ramadan . "
that , he said , would never be allowed to happen .
mr coghill speaks for the lord 's day observance society .
" as a christian organisation we would say we were born again , " he added .
" but we certainly were n't born yesterday ... if we had been any other religious minority the government would be moving heaven and earth to make sure that our religious sensitivities were n't trampled over . "
day of rest but he , and others on his side of the debate , are quite happy to spin the discussion , in an attempt to engage with people who do n't necessarily take the bible as the final authority .
councillor morag munro lives just outside leverburgh .
on her croft , she told me she thought anyone would appreciate having a day set aside as a special day of rest .
" would you not like to have one special day which you can share with your family and friends , when you can put off the pressures of work , the stress and the targets ? " she asked .
rather than us following the rest of the country , the rest of the country should follow us councillor morag munro " do you not think that would be a good thing for the health of the nation ? "
other people talked about the fear that sunday sailings might damage - rather than enhance - the islands ' tourism industry .
if they become more like mainland scotland , the argument runs , then the visitors might not come any more .
when sunday flights into stornoway airport started , some of the christian protestors were happy to speak about them as a form of " cultural imperialism " .
and the same theme was echoed this time round .
there 's bemusement - why ca n't lewis and harris be allowed to be different from the rest of scotland , the rest of the uk , if they want to be ?
and there 's no acceptance that the issue of sabbath observance is a lost cause .
" what i would like to promote " , cllr munro told me , " is that rather than us following the rest of the country , the rest of the country should follow us . "
yellow tape was strung across the road at the slipway the ferry company , calmac , chose not to comment on the rights and wrongs of the protest .
on the quayside at leverburgh , once the tapes had been cut to allow cars to move freely onto and off the boat , company spokesman hugh dan maclennan told me that people had the right to make their point of view known .
but , he said , the company was responding to public demand .
this , he said , is a life-line service , and people want to be able to travel up and down the whole of the western isles whenever they need to .
every generalisation about this story is probably wrong .
it 's not about church people versus non-church people .
there are plenty of non-christians who appreciate the unique sunday you get in the hebrides .
but i suspect there are also some christians who would n't be quite so hard-line on this issue as their leaders are .
wait and watch and it 's not even about lewis and harris versus berneray and the uists .
even if there 's more public support for the sunday sailings the further south you go , there are people on both sides of the argument on both sides of the sound of harris .
we 'll all have to wait , and watch , and see whether the islands change irrevocably now that sunday sailings have started .
but if they do , one young free church member told me , it 'll be too late .
she said she feared that many who were happy to see traditional sundays disappear would only realise how much they missed them after they 'd gone .
but then , she said , it would be too late .

that added insult to injury .
" given that the people travelling on that ferry must have a certain anti-christian sabbath mentality " , the reverend andrew coghill told me , " it 's really the equivalent of driving a convoy of bnp supporters past a mosque in the middle of ramadan . "
that , he said , would never be allowed to happen .
mr coghill speaks for the lord 's day observance society .
" as a christian organisation we would say we were born again , " he added .
" but we certainly were n't born yesterday ... if we had been any other religious minority the government would be moving heaven and earth to make sure that our religious sensitivities were n't trampled over . "

councillor morag munro lives just outside leverburgh .
on her croft , she told me she thought anyone would appreciate having a day set aside as a special day of rest .
" would you not like to have one special day which you can share with your family and friends , when you can put off the pressures of work , the stress and the targets ? " she asked .
rather than us following the rest of the country , the rest of the country should follow us councillor morag munro " do you not think that would be a good thing for the health of the nation ? "
other people talked about the fear that sunday sailings might damage - rather than enhance - the islands ' tourism industry .
if they become more like mainland scotland , the argument runs , then the visitors might not come any more .
when sunday flights into stornoway airport started , some of the christian protestors were happy to speak about them as a form of " cultural imperialism " .
and the same theme was echoed this time round .
there 's bemusement - why ca n't lewis and harris be allowed to be different from the rest of scotland , the rest of the uk , if they want to be ?
and there 's no acceptance that the issue of sabbath observance is a lost cause .
" what i would like to promote " , cllr munro told me , " is that rather than us following the rest of the country , the rest of the country should follow us . "
yellow tape was strung across the road at the slipway the ferry company , calmac , chose not to comment on the rights and wrongs of the protest .
on the quayside at leverburgh , once the tapes had been cut to allow cars to move freely onto and off the boat , company spokesman hugh dan maclennan told me that people had the right to make their point of view known .
but , he said , the company was responding to public demand .
this , he said , is a life-line service , and people want to be able to travel up and down the whole of the western isles whenever they need to .
every generalisation about this story is probably wrong .
it 's not about church people versus non-church people .
there are plenty of non-christians who appreciate the unique sunday you get in the hebrides .
but i suspect there are also some christians who would n't be quite so hard-line on this issue as their leaders are .
wait and watch and it 's not even about lewis and harris versus berneray and the uists .
even if there 's more public support for the sunday sailings the further south you go , there are people on both sides of the argument on both sides of the sound of harris .
we 'll all have to wait , and watch , and see whether the islands change irrevocably now that sunday sailings have started .
but if they do , one young free church member told me , it 'll be too late .
she said she feared that many who were happy to see traditional sundays disappear would only realise how much they missed them after they 'd gone .
but then , she said , it would be too late .

john howard said terence cole , who is heading the inquiry into the australian wheat board , made the request .
" i will provide that statement to the inquiry tomorrow , consistent with the request , " mr howard said on monday .
it is alleged the wheat board paid millions of dollars in bribes to saddam hussein 's regime .
mr howard later said the request showed the judge was not trying to protect the administration .
iraq accounted for about 15 % of total australian wheat exports " i 've said all along this is an utterly transparent process which is not protecting the government but which is designed to get to the truth of this matter , and i 'm more than happy to comply with the request made by the commission , " he said at a press conference in sydney .
trade minister the illegal payments are alleged to have been made under iraq 's oil-for-food programme .
a united nations report published last year accused awb of paying up to $ 222m to saddam hussein 's regime between 1997 and 2003 to secure lucrative grain contracts .
it is alleged that under the auspices of the oil-for-food programme - which allowed iraq to export a limited amount of oil to pay for food - money was channelled to the regime through a jordanian trucking firm owned by the government .
trade minister mark vaile appeared before the inquiry on monday and foreign minister alexander downer is due to appear later this week .
mr vaile told the inquiry he did not see a series of cables warning of possible awb corruption .
he said he was " aware in a very general sense " that the un had raised concerns about the activities of the awb , but he said he thought the matter was being dealt with by australian trade officials .
the allegations threaten australia 's chances of securing a lucrative contract to export 1m tonnes of wheat to iraq .
australia exports some 2.5m tonnes of wheat to iraq every year .

the number of us households listening to podcasts will increase to just 12 million by 2010 , a forrester research report has found .
tech savvy , young males are most likely to listen to take away audio it said .
but a survey by research firm bmrb found that nearly eight million britons will go in search of a podcast in the next six months .
the different numbers could suggest that uk consumers are a bunch of technophiles , much happier to dip their toe into the water than their us counterparts , or that coming up with these numbers is an imprecise science .
charlene li , one of the authors of the forrester report admitted on her blog that " measurement is still really hard to do " .
in particular she said that " counting podcast downloads is a dubious way to measure usage . "
difficult numbers podcasts seem to have had a meteoric rise , moving from the preserve of a few interested techies to the technology of choice for any company trying to appeal to the digital generation .
it is like a radio broadcast , but one that you can download from the internet to any mp3 player , not just an ipod as the name suggests .
one of challenges with podcasting is that there are no audited or reliable reporting mechanisms sarah prag , bbc you can use pieces of software to automatically gather the podcasts and pop them straight on to your player , meaning that you always have the latest programme in your pocket .
the technology has got traditional broadcasters excited and worried at the same time .
the technology gives them a new opportunity to distribute their programmes and potentially a whole new audience .
but podcasting is cheap .
all you need is a laptop , a microphone and a bit of a flair for technology and you can create your own programmes .
as a result broadcasters are worried that their market share will be washed away over night by a torrent of amateur broadcasters and companies that look on podcasts as a useful way to get their message out .
hence , broadcasters , advertising companies and financial institutions are all clamouring to work out who is online , where they 're downloading and what they 're listening to .
tiny audience the survey of 5,000 us consumers by forrester found that 3 % had tried listening to a podcast .
of them , 2 % had experimented with audio downloads but did not listen on a regular basis .
fewer women download and listen to podcasts there will be just 700,000 diehard downloaders in the us this year ; a tiny audience compared to the 25 million people who tune into stations run by traditional broadcaster national public radio -lrb- npr -rrb- every week .
the report says that it will take a long time for people to ditch their transistors and join this small group of breakaways because downloading programmes is complicated and content is sparse .
however , the good news for broadcasters is that the people who persevere gravitate towards audio from established radio stations rather than relative newbies .
rough guess the forrester survey backs up some of the findings in a report from another research firm , bmrb .
its survey looked at digital consumption in the uk .
it also found that podcasts are the preserve of young males .
but it predicts a much quicker uptake of podcasts in uk households , with around eight million adults logging on and walking away with their favourite radio programmes in their pocket by september this year .
the huge discrepancy between the figures for the us and the uk could point to relative differences in listening habits , online dexterity or even national character .
it could also reflect just how difficult it is to make these predictions .
digital listeners even broadcasters can only take a rough guess at many people are actually listening to their podcasts .
radio 1 dj chris moyles tops the bbc downloads " one of challenges with podcasting is that there are no audited or reliable reporting mechanisms , " said sarah prag , a senior project manager responsible for the bbc podcast trial .

so who becomes one of the prison service 's " screws " and why ?
it is stressful work in a stressful environment " if we 've managed to get through without them hurting themselves or anyone else , " is how prison officer sonia leonard sums up a good day at work at hmp wormwood scrubs .
" when a man 's locked away , he has to ask for everything .
he ca n't go out and do anything , get a toilet roll , help himself , " she explains .
" there 's 10 of you , and 250 men , on one wing .
every one has a need and it 's important to make time if they say ' i need to talk ' . "
self harm , suicide risk and assaults are some of the serious problems the 53-year-old faces at the west london prison .
she has worked there for five years , as a standard grade officer , earning up to £ 26,000 a year .
the role is hard , with high sick leave rates because of its physical nature .
cutting is the most common form of self-harm among inmates , although none of the 250 men on sonia 's wing are currently logged in its record book .
' lowest point ' the scrubs also has one of the highest suicide rates among uk prisons and it is " more and more of a problem " , says fellow officer john hancock , 55 .
he believes pressure on fewer staff make it harder to prevent .
sonia hit the rock bottom of a ten-year career in 2004 when a 29-year-old lifer killed himself .
suicides at the scrubs 2006 jan-march : 1 2005:3 2004:3 2003:1 total 1996-present : 13 source : howard league for penal reform he had at least five years left to serve and as his personnel officer , she had to testify at his inquest .
" that 's the worst thing i 've ever had to do , my lowest point in my career , to go to an inquest and talk about somebody i have done a lot of work with , " she says .
" when someone kills themselves it 's a shock , a terrible experience .
you have to go on because it 's your job .
there 's other prisoners to talk to and it affects them . "
how to deal with prisoner suicides , and its depressive impact among dozens of other inmates , is one of the aspects for which officers undergo weeks of classroom training .
they cover control and restraint of prisoners , using the radio , security , how to tackle assault and fighting , their own fitness and dealing with inmates ' diversity , before taking up a post behind prison gates .
regimented day the service had 48,140 staff in 128 uk prisons at june 2005 , with another 11 prisons in the private sector .
of those staff , 24,394 were prison officers .
they work a 39-hour week , in shifts around the clock , and the job entails many roles - gaoler , counsellor , restrainer .
officers are more likely to take sick leave than those in other jobs each day has a regimented structure - from the counting of inmates at 0745 , through meals , education , visits , work , association time - to lock-up at 2000 .
it is stressful work in a stressful environment .
in 2002 , there were 2,692 assaults on prison staff .
in 2004-5 , 1,294 left the service , 112 of those on health grounds .
the service 's pay review body report for 2006 records that the physical nature of prison work means a higher level of sick leave .
international inmates but they face more than physical challenges in their daily work .
both officers testify to the widespread drug use in prison and say that heroin , crack and cannabis have an impact on what they try to achieve with inmates .
the majority of prisoners have drug and alcohol abuse issues or are in for drug smuggling , partly because the scrubs is situated close to heathrow airport and not far from gatwick .
we do n't get too friendly with them - that would be ridiculous - and they have respect for us john hancock drugs come over the prison wall day and night , says john .
" if you 're not on top of it it 's a problem .
there 's a huge prison population that uses drugs .
if they ca n't get hold of drugs , the bullying goes up . "
they grapple with an " amazing " level of illiteracy among prisoners and communication is also an issue among the multi-cultural prison population - currently they lack enough chinese translators .
and they say a lack of funding for staff , resources and courses harms prisoners ' chances for rehabilitation and education .
treatment scandal in the 1990s and early 2000s , wormwood scrubs was the subject of a scandal over prisoner treatment .
of its then 400 officers , 27 were accused over ill-treatment of inmates .
three officers were jailed , but later acquitted , for violence .
the prison survived a damning report by the chief inspector of prisons that gave it a year to improve or face closure .
wormwood scrubs victorian , built 1875-1891 category b prisoners five wings a : remand b : induction c : convicted d : convicted and work e : resettlement john says the period was " particularly difficult " with low morale .
he would still welcome a full public inquiry into the episode and believes the case and report were partly politically motivated .
morale has improved since then and both officers say a culture of mutual respect operates in the scrubs ; that there is a line they and prisoners approach , but do not cross .
" we do n't get too friendly with them - that would be ridiculous - and they have respect for us , " says john , 55 .
" most people who live and work in a prison know where that line is .
if you make a promise to an inmate , you have to keep it . "
' a soft word ' given the level of strains and pressures they stand compared to a job outside prison walls , it is surprising to hear them describe their work in the definite , positive terms they use .
" career-wise , its the best decision i ever made , " says sonia , who adds that a previous five years at feltham young offenders institution were " wonderful " .
" when i applied and was accepted , it was a life-changing moment .
i thought i would just have a job for the rest of my life , not a career , but this has opened up so many doors . "
she applied to the service in her 40s after guarding prisoners in court : " i get on well with people .
they came to court for a few hours , confided in me and i thought , there must be more i can do .
the scrubs faced allegations of abuse in the 1990s " a lot of them had personal troubles , abuse , abuse of alcohol or drugs .
after 15-20 minutes they 'd say ' thankyou ' and i would think ' what have i done ? ' - it was that i 'd listened .
" i 'm no soft touch , but everybody - no matter what they 've done - needs a soft word sometimes . "
john says he was in the " right place at the right time " when he decided to join 18 years ago .
" i thought it would be a challenge to be a prison officer because so many different things crop up , " he says .
" i was good in lead roles with other men .
i 've seen a little bit of life and the people you come across do n't faze me . "
making prison a workplace has given them a unique perspective , however .
fresh from jury service on a fraud case , sonia enjoyed the experience , but not the result .
" when we found them guilty , i felt awful .
because i knew where they were going , i knew what it involved , how they would feel . "

" when a man 's locked away , he has to ask for everything .
he ca n't go out and do anything , get a toilet roll , help himself , " she explains .
" there 's 10 of you , and 250 men , on one wing .
every one has a need and it 's important to make time if they say ' i need to talk ' . "
self harm , suicide risk and assaults are some of the serious problems the 53-year-old faces at the west london prison .
she has worked there for five years , as a standard grade officer , earning up to £ 26,000 a year .
the role is hard , with high sick leave rates because of its physical nature .
cutting is the most common form of self-harm among inmates , although none of the 250 men on sonia 's wing are currently logged in its record book .
' lowest point ' the scrubs also has one of the highest suicide rates among uk prisons and it is " more and more of a problem " , says fellow officer john hancock , 55 .
he believes pressure on fewer staff make it harder to prevent .
sonia hit the rock bottom of a ten-year career in 2004 when a 29-year-old lifer killed himself .
suicides at the scrubs 2006 jan-march : 1 2005:3 2004:3 2003:1 total 1996-present : 13 source : howard league for penal reform he had at least five years left to serve and as his personnel officer , she had to testify at his inquest .
" that 's the worst thing i 've ever had to do , my lowest point in my career , to go to an inquest and talk about somebody i have done a lot of work with , " she says .
" when someone kills themselves it 's a shock , a terrible experience .
you have to go on because it 's your job .
there 's other prisoners to talk to and it affects them . "
how to deal with prisoner suicides , and its depressive impact among dozens of other inmates , is one of the aspects for which officers undergo weeks of classroom training .
they cover control and restraint of prisoners , using the radio , security , how to tackle assault and fighting , their own fitness and dealing with inmates ' diversity , before taking up a post behind prison gates .
regimented day the service had 48,140 staff in 128 uk prisons at june 2005 , with another 11 prisons in the private sector .
of those staff , 24,394 were prison officers .
they work a 39-hour week , in shifts around the clock , and the job entails many roles - gaoler , counsellor , restrainer .
officers are more likely to take sick leave than those in other jobs each day has a regimented structure - from the counting of inmates at 0745 , through meals , education , visits , work , association time - to lock-up at 2000 .
it is stressful work in a stressful environment .
in 2002 , there were 2,692 assaults on prison staff .
in 2004-5 , 1,294 left the service , 112 of those on health grounds .
the service 's pay review body report for 2006 records that the physical nature of prison work means a higher level of sick leave .
international inmates but they face more than physical challenges in their daily work .
both officers testify to the widespread drug use in prison and say that heroin , crack and cannabis have an impact on what they try to achieve with inmates .
the majority of prisoners have drug and alcohol abuse issues or are in for drug smuggling , partly because the scrubs is situated close to heathrow airport and not far from gatwick .
we do n't get too friendly with them - that would be ridiculous - and they have respect for us john hancock drugs come over the prison wall day and night , says john .
" if you 're not on top of it it 's a problem .
there 's a huge prison population that uses drugs .
if they ca n't get hold of drugs , the bullying goes up . "
they grapple with an " amazing " level of illiteracy among prisoners and communication is also an issue among the multi-cultural prison population - currently they lack enough chinese translators .
and they say a lack of funding for staff , resources and courses harms prisoners ' chances for rehabilitation and education .
treatment scandal in the 1990s and early 2000s , wormwood scrubs was the subject of a scandal over prisoner treatment .
of its then 400 officers , 27 were accused over ill-treatment of inmates .
three officers were jailed , but later acquitted , for violence .
the prison survived a damning report by the chief inspector of prisons that gave it a year to improve or face closure .
wormwood scrubs victorian , built 1875-1891 category b prisoners five wings a : remand b : induction c : convicted d : convicted and work e : resettlement john says the period was " particularly difficult " with low morale .
he would still welcome a full public inquiry into the episode and believes the case and report were partly politically motivated .
morale has improved since then and both officers say a culture of mutual respect operates in the scrubs ; that there is a line they and prisoners approach , but do not cross .
" we do n't get too friendly with them - that would be ridiculous - and they have respect for us , " says john , 55 .
" most people who live and work in a prison know where that line is .
if you make a promise to an inmate , you have to keep it . "
' a soft word ' given the level of strains and pressures they stand compared to a job outside prison walls , it is surprising to hear them describe their work in the definite , positive terms they use .
" career-wise , its the best decision i ever made , " says sonia , who adds that a previous five years at feltham young offenders institution were " wonderful " .
" when i applied and was accepted , it was a life-changing moment .
i thought i would just have a job for the rest of my life , not a career , but this has opened up so many doors . "
she applied to the service in her 40s after guarding prisoners in court : " i get on well with people .
they came to court for a few hours , confided in me and i thought , there must be more i can do .
the scrubs faced allegations of abuse in the 1990s " a lot of them had personal troubles , abuse , abuse of alcohol or drugs .
after 15-20 minutes they 'd say ' thankyou ' and i would think ' what have i done ? ' - it was that i 'd listened .
" i 'm no soft touch , but everybody - no matter what they 've done - needs a soft word sometimes . "
john says he was in the " right place at the right time " when he decided to join 18 years ago .
" i thought it would be a challenge to be a prison officer because so many different things crop up , " he says .
" i was good in lead roles with other men .
i 've seen a little bit of life and the people you come across do n't faze me . "
making prison a workplace has given them a unique perspective , however .
fresh from jury service on a fraud case , sonia enjoyed the experience , but not the result .
" when we found them guilty , i felt awful .
because i knew where they were going , i knew what it involved , how they would feel . "

wormwood scrubs victorian , built 1875-1891 category b prisoners five wings a : remand b : induction c : convicted d : convicted and work e : resettlement john says the period was " particularly difficult " with low morale .
he would still welcome a full public inquiry into the episode and believes the case and report were partly politically motivated .
morale has improved since then and both officers say a culture of mutual respect operates in the scrubs ; that there is a line they and prisoners approach , but do not cross .
" we do n't get too friendly with them - that would be ridiculous - and they have respect for us , " says john , 55 .
" most people who live and work in a prison know where that line is .
if you make a promise to an inmate , you have to keep it . "
' a soft word ' given the level of strains and pressures they stand compared to a job outside prison walls , it is surprising to hear them describe their work in the definite , positive terms they use .
" career-wise , its the best decision i ever made , " says sonia , who adds that a previous five years at feltham young offenders institution were " wonderful " .
" when i applied and was accepted , it was a life-changing moment .
i thought i would just have a job for the rest of my life , not a career , but this has opened up so many doors . "
she applied to the service in her 40s after guarding prisoners in court : " i get on well with people .
they came to court for a few hours , confided in me and i thought , there must be more i can do .
" a lot of them had personal troubles , abuse , abuse of alcohol or drugs .
after 15-20 minutes they 'd say ' thankyou ' and i would think ' what have i done ? ' - it was that i 'd listened .
" i 'm no soft touch , but everybody - no matter what they 've done - needs a soft word sometimes . "
john says he was in the " right place at the right time " when he decided to join 18 years ago .
" i thought it would be a challenge to be a prison officer because so many different things crop up , " he says .
" i was good in lead roles with other men .
i 've seen a little bit of life and the people you come across do n't faze me . "
making prison a workplace has given them a unique perspective , however .
fresh from jury service on a fraud case , sonia enjoyed the experience , but not the result .
" when we found them guilty , i felt awful .
because i knew where they were going , i knew what it involved , how they would feel . "

mr portillo , who quit as an mp at the last election , said the tory leader had to " smash the pigeon hole " his party had been in since the thatcher years .
" it is not just david cameron who has to look different , " mr portillo said .
this weekend mr cameron wrapped up his first tory conference as leader with a call for rapid and deep change .
he told the conservative spring gathering in manchester that britain " desperately " needed a conservative party " ready to tackle the big changes " the country faces .
mr cameron 's speech came just a day after research for the bbc 's newsnight suggested the tories will lose council seats in the local elections on 4 may .
new and fresh ?
mr portillo told bbc radio 4 's today programme he did not entirely believe that the honeymoon was over for mr cameron .
he said he backed the new conservative leader 's programme for change - the word that emblazoned banners at the conference .
the former defence secretary said : " i believe the change idea is entirely the right one .
the only doubt i have is whether he has yet done enough to convince the public .
" i am not so worried about whether the party likes change or not .
the important thing is that the public should see change is really occurring - one of the difficulties he has got is that the team in the shadow cabinet contains a lot of people who are from the party 's past .
" and so while david cameron in his visual images riding on a bicycle , for example , clearly represents something new and fresh and changed , the other people who are out there putting out the message look like more of a throwback to former periods . "
' real change ' he added : " people have formed an impression of the conservatives over a generation , really since margaret thatcher came to power , and what david cameron is trying to do is smash the pigeon hole in which the tories have been locked since that time . "
in his keynote speech on saturday , mr cameron said : " i know some of you think we have had quite enough change for the time being - that now is the time to pause , perhaps to reflect .
time to take it easy .
" well i say britain ca n't wait while we take it easy .
this change in our party has to get faster , it must go wider and deeper .
" it is not enough for the leader to change , we will have to change and we must show that the change is real , that it is lasting . "

the former defence secretary said : " i believe the change idea is entirely the right one .
the only doubt i have is whether he has yet done enough to convince the public .
" i am not so worried about whether the party likes change or not .
the important thing is that the public should see change is really occurring - one of the difficulties he has got is that the team in the shadow cabinet contains a lot of people who are from the party 's past .
" and so while david cameron in his visual images riding on a bicycle , for example , clearly represents something new and fresh and changed , the other people who are out there putting out the message look like more of a throwback to former periods . "
' real change ' he added : " people have formed an impression of the conservatives over a generation , really since margaret thatcher came to power , and what david cameron is trying to do is smash the pigeon hole in which the tories have been locked since that time . "
in his keynote speech on saturday , mr cameron said : " i know some of you think we have had quite enough change for the time being - that now is the time to pause , perhaps to reflect .
time to take it easy .
" well i say britain ca n't wait while we take it easy .
this change in our party has to get faster , it must go wider and deeper .
" it is not enough for the leader to change , we will have to change and we must show that the change is real , that it is lasting . "
