defense minister jung plans to visit the middle east this week . the incident occurred on thursday night involving a helicopter belonging to the german navy and israeli f16 bombers .
according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper , several israeli jets had forced the german helicopter to give way .
german defense minister franz josef jung played down the incident .
one could n't speak of a " confrontation with israeli soldiers , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- . a german defense ministry spokesman said the incident had not been dangerous or threatening .
the israeli military leadership had promised there would be no more such occurrences , the spokesman added . case closed ? " there were certain incidents , which we discussed with israel in the appropriate manner , " jung told the faz .
" i view the case thus as closed , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister said the case was closed germany was taken by surprise by the most recent incident , as israeli defense minister amir peretz recently smoothed over ruffled feathers after a confrontation on tuesday between israeli aircraft and a german vessel patrolling lebanon 's coast .
according to the german version of events , israeli jets had flown very low over the german ship and fired two shots .
a german helicopter that took off after the shots were fired was forced to land by the jets . the israeli army denied that shots had been fired but issued differing versions of events over the subsequent days .
jung plans to travel to the middle east this week , but has cancelled a trip to asia that was due to begin sunday .
the german army is patrolling the coast of lebanon under a un mandate to prevent illegal arms deliveries to the hezbollah militia . concerns about foreign missions the decision to deploy german troops near israel was initially met with skepticism by german politicians and the public amid fears that confrontations between german soldiers and israelis could occur .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former defense minister struck suggested it was time to end the mission in bosnia it was kosovo that prompted germany to break with a postwar taboo on sending its troops into combat when it contributed to the nato aerial bombing campaign in the serbian province in 1999 . this month marked another break with the past as the german navy took command of the marine component of the un force in lebanon in germany 's first military foray into the middle east since world war ii .
the mission got off to a rocky start when six israeli warplanes confronted an unarmed german ship and a helicopter backing up marines in the mediterranean .
merkel naive ?
a heated debate has erupted at home , both about the germans ' restricted mandate in lebanon and the risk that they could clash with israeli soldiers - a possibility that is viewed uneasily in germany and israel because of the nazis ' persecution of the jews . germany chose not to send ground troops to the lebanon peacekeeping force because of that risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a mandate to patrol the lebanese coast the opposition has accused conservative chancellor angela merkel of misleading parliament in a bid to win its approval for the mission , while the press said she was naive to believe germany could avoid all confrontation with israeli forces . the lebanon mission has not been popular with the public , nor has merkel 's decision to send german troops to lead the european force that was sunday monitoring presidential elections in the strife-torn democratic republic of congo . under the headline " the home front is divided , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said the skull scandal has made any extension of the mandate of the drc mission unlikely . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .

the gas pumped through the langeled pipeline will cover up to 20 percent of britain 's needs in coming years .
the scandinavian country already supplies 30 percent of france 's needs and 25 percent of germany 's . " due to the fact that consumption of gas is increasing in europe ... there is a clear increased interest for norwegian supply of gas and therefore we 're increasing our production and exports , " norwegian oil and energy minister odd roger enoksen told afp .
eu change of heart from 50 billion cubic meters in 2000 , exports are expected to swell to 130 billion cubic meters in 2010 . the rise is warmly welcomed by european countries keen to ensure secure energy supplies and diversify their suppliers beyond russia , which meets 25 percent of europe 's gas needs . a " gas war " between moscow and kiev in the dead of winter a year ago illustrated europe 's vulnerability : russia turned off the taps to ukraine after a dispute over prices , leading to knock-on disruption of supplies across europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia turned off ukraine gas last winter " norway has been an important actor in the gas sector for a long time and will remain so .
but it is brussels ' perception of norway that has changed , " said an analyst at enskilda securities , arnstein wigestrand . the eu previously objected to norway 's practice of signing long-term supply agreements , urging suppliers and clients on the continent to review the terms of their contracts to ensure smoother gas supplies to the market , he recalled . " but now the eu has changed its stance .
in brussels , they must be rubbing their hands in glee for each cubic meter that the norwegians are delivering , " the analyst said .
no russian-norwegian competition , oil minister says russia recently signed a memorandum of understanding on gas cooperation with algeria , the eu 's third biggest supplier with an 11 percent market share , raising fears of a possible gas cartel .
the possibility of an " opec for gas " appears very hypothetical , but norway has already ruled out participating in such a group . " for a large quantity of our production we have long-term contracts , and we are part of the european economic area agreement and we have liberalized and opened up our gas supply completely , so we have no intention of going in that direction , " enoksen said .

otherwise , if you do n't do what 's needed to have a secure supply of gas , the consuming countries can change from gas to other energy sources , " he said . with the langeled pipeline just freshly in place , norway is already looking to build a new gas pipeline to europe to add to the 7,800 kilometers -lrb- 4,850 miles -rrb- already laid down or under construction .

the scandinavian country already supplies 30 percent of france 's needs and 25 percent of germany 's . " due to the fact that consumption of gas is increasing in europe ... there is a clear increased interest for norwegian supply of gas and therefore we 're increasing our production and exports , " norwegian oil and energy minister odd roger enoksen told afp .
eu change of heart from 50 billion cubic meters in 2000 , exports are expected to swell to 130 billion cubic meters in 2010 . the rise is warmly welcomed by european countries keen to ensure secure energy supplies and diversify their suppliers beyond russia , which meets 25 percent of europe 's gas needs . a " gas war " between moscow and kiev in the dead of winter a year ago illustrated europe 's vulnerability : russia turned off the taps to ukraine after a dispute over prices , leading to knock-on disruption of supplies across europe .

this was n't a prediction brought on by a visit to a fortune teller or an arrogant statement before a match against the currently most woeful side in the bundesliga , but a sly dig at germany 's highest court which had enforced a ban on bremen 's sponsor , online betting firm bwin.com. whether bremen will win their next challenge , one in court rather than on the soccer field , is another matter .
battering bottom-of-the-league bochum is one thing , taking on the federal constitutional court is another . but that is exactly what bremen intends to do .
the bundesliga leaders have filed a complaint to the court in an attempt to overturn the ban and have bwin returned to the chests of klose , frings and co .

gambling is a state monopoly in france and online betting firms are banned from seeking clients on french territory . bwin is just one of the online commercial betting firms which are facing opposition throughout europe as countries look to protect their own national gambling interests . competition law infringements investigated the practice of banning online commercial betting firms is under investigation by the european commission , which believes that nations which restrict their gambling markets are infringing on competition regulations . the commission has recently sought information from france and italy on sports and online betting and from austria on the casino industry .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former defense minister struck suggested it was time to end the mission in bosnia it was kosovo that prompted germany to break with a postwar taboo on sending its troops into combat when it contributed to the nato aerial bombing campaign in the serbian province in 1999 . this month marked another break with the past as the german navy took command of the marine component of the un force in lebanon in germany 's first military foray into the middle east since world war ii .
the mission got off to a rocky start when six israeli warplanes confronted an unarmed german ship and a helicopter backing up marines in the mediterranean .
merkel naive ?
a heated debate has erupted at home , both about the germans ' restricted mandate in lebanon and the risk that they could clash with israeli soldiers - a possibility that is viewed uneasily in germany and israel because of the nazis ' persecution of the jews . germany chose not to send ground troops to the lebanon peacekeeping force because of that risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a mandate to patrol the lebanese coast the opposition has accused conservative chancellor angela merkel of misleading parliament in a bid to win its approval for the mission , while the press said she was naive to believe germany could avoid all confrontation with israeli forces . the lebanon mission has not been popular with the public , nor has merkel 's decision to send german troops to lead the european force that was sunday monitoring presidential elections in the strife-torn democratic republic of congo . under the headline " the home front is divided , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said the skull scandal has made any extension of the mandate of the drc mission unlikely . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former defense minister struck suggested it was time to end the mission in bosnia it was kosovo that prompted germany to break with a postwar taboo on sending its troops into combat when it contributed to the nato aerial bombing campaign in the serbian province in 1999 . this month marked another break with the past as the german navy took command of the marine component of the un force in lebanon in germany 's first military foray into the middle east since world war ii .
the mission got off to a rocky start when six israeli warplanes confronted an unarmed german ship and a helicopter backing up marines in the mediterranean .

a heated debate has erupted at home , both about the germans ' restricted mandate in lebanon and the risk that they could clash with israeli soldiers - a possibility that is viewed uneasily in germany and israel because of the nazis ' persecution of the jews . germany chose not to send ground troops to the lebanon peacekeeping force because of that risk .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former defense minister struck suggested it was time to end the mission in bosnia it was kosovo that prompted germany to break with a postwar taboo on sending its troops into combat when it contributed to the nato aerial bombing campaign in the serbian province in 1999 . this month marked another break with the past as the german navy took command of the marine component of the un force in lebanon in germany 's first military foray into the middle east since world war ii .
the mission got off to a rocky start when six israeli warplanes confronted an unarmed german ship and a helicopter backing up marines in the mediterranean .
merkel naive ?
a heated debate has erupted at home , both about the germans ' restricted mandate in lebanon and the risk that they could clash with israeli soldiers - a possibility that is viewed uneasily in germany and israel because of the nazis ' persecution of the jews . germany chose not to send ground troops to the lebanon peacekeeping force because of that risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a mandate to patrol the lebanese coast the opposition has accused conservative chancellor angela merkel of misleading parliament in a bid to win its approval for the mission , while the press said she was naive to believe germany could avoid all confrontation with israeli forces . the lebanon mission has not been popular with the public , nor has merkel 's decision to send german troops to lead the european force that was sunday monitoring presidential elections in the strife-torn democratic republic of congo . under the headline " the home front is divided , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said the skull scandal has made any extension of the mandate of the drc mission unlikely . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

this was n't a prediction brought on by a visit to a fortune teller or an arrogant statement before a match against the currently most woeful side in the bundesliga , but a sly dig at germany 's highest court which had enforced a ban on bremen 's sponsor , online betting firm bwin.com. whether bremen will win their next challenge , one in court rather than on the soccer field , is another matter .
battering bottom-of-the-league bochum is one thing , taking on the federal constitutional court is another . but that is exactly what bremen intends to do .
the bundesliga leaders have filed a complaint to the court in an attempt to overturn the ban and have bwin returned to the chests of klose , frings and co .

gambling is a state monopoly in france and online betting firms are banned from seeking clients on french territory . bwin is just one of the online commercial betting firms which are facing opposition throughout europe as countries look to protect their own national gambling interests . competition law infringements investigated the practice of banning online commercial betting firms is under investigation by the european commission , which believes that nations which restrict their gambling markets are infringing on competition regulations . the commission has recently sought information from france and italy on sports and online betting and from austria on the casino industry .

"
this was n't a prediction brought on by a visit to a fortune teller or an arrogant statement before a match against the currently most woeful side in the bundesliga , but a sly dig at germany 's highest court which had enforced a ban on bremen 's sponsor , online betting firm bwin.com. whether bremen will win their next challenge , one in court rather than on the soccer field , is another matter .
battering bottom-of-the-league bochum is one thing , taking on the federal constitutional court is another . but that is exactly what bremen intends to do .
the bundesliga leaders have filed a complaint to the court in an attempt to overturn the ban and have bwin returned to the chests of klose , frings and co .
the northern city state of bremen banned the promotion of commercial betting firms in july and werder have been restricted in their advertising since . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alternative logo works while bremen keep winning " until we have new regulations , werder bremen should be allowed to promote private betting firms , " the club said on its web site , adding that it had filed the complaint on oct .
13 . states crack down on commercial betting the austrian internet betting firm , whose german unit is the nation 's biggest commercial bookmaker and which also sponsors second-tier club 1860 munich , is increasingly embattled , with bans on commercial betting imposed on it by three federal states as germany 's regions seek to maintain their lucrative monopoly over the market . on monday , bwin.com said it would cut its budget for german soccer sponsorship next year due to the attempts by the regional governments to completely outlaw commercial sports betting .
the company said in a statement that this would not affect its current deal with werder bremen banned in france , probed in italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ac milan do n't have bremen 's problem - yet bwin was dealt a similar blow in france this month when as monaco , one of a number of teams outside germany that the company sponsors , was forced to remove advertising boards for the firm from around the side of the ligue 1 team 's pitch . the french professional football league -lrb- lfp -rrb- has banned its clubs from advertising any form of gambling and online betting . the lfp ban came after the two joint chief executives of bwin.com interactive entertainment were placed under investigation earlier in october for alleged violation of french gaming laws .
gambling is a state monopoly in france and online betting firms are banned from seeking clients on french territory . bwin is just one of the online commercial betting firms which are facing opposition throughout europe as countries look to protect their own national gambling interests . competition law infringements investigated the practice of banning online commercial betting firms is under investigation by the european commission , which believes that nations which restrict their gambling markets are infringing on competition regulations . the commission has recently sought information from france and italy on sports and online betting and from austria on the casino industry .

the gas pumped through the langeled pipeline will cover up to 20 percent of britain 's needs in coming years .
the scandinavian country already supplies 30 percent of france 's needs and 25 percent of germany 's . " due to the fact that consumption of gas is increasing in europe ... there is a clear increased interest for norwegian supply of gas and therefore we 're increasing our production and exports , " norwegian oil and energy minister odd roger enoksen told afp .
eu change of heart from 50 billion cubic meters in 2000 , exports are expected to swell to 130 billion cubic meters in 2010 . the rise is warmly welcomed by european countries keen to ensure secure energy supplies and diversify their suppliers beyond russia , which meets 25 percent of europe 's gas needs . a " gas war " between moscow and kiev in the dead of winter a year ago illustrated europe 's vulnerability : russia turned off the taps to ukraine after a dispute over prices , leading to knock-on disruption of supplies across europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia turned off ukraine gas last winter " norway has been an important actor in the gas sector for a long time and will remain so .
but it is brussels ' perception of norway that has changed , " said an analyst at enskilda securities , arnstein wigestrand . the eu previously objected to norway 's practice of signing long-term supply agreements , urging suppliers and clients on the continent to review the terms of their contracts to ensure smoother gas supplies to the market , he recalled . " but now the eu has changed its stance .
in brussels , they must be rubbing their hands in glee for each cubic meter that the norwegians are delivering , " the analyst said .
no russian-norwegian competition , oil minister says russia recently signed a memorandum of understanding on gas cooperation with algeria , the eu 's third biggest supplier with an 11 percent market share , raising fears of a possible gas cartel .
the possibility of an " opec for gas " appears very hypothetical , but norway has already ruled out participating in such a group . " for a large quantity of our production we have long-term contracts , and we are part of the european economic area agreement and we have liberalized and opened up our gas supply completely , so we have no intention of going in that direction , " enoksen said .

otherwise , if you do n't do what 's needed to have a secure supply of gas , the consuming countries can change from gas to other energy sources , " he said . with the langeled pipeline just freshly in place , norway is already looking to build a new gas pipeline to europe to add to the 7,800 kilometers -lrb- 4,850 miles -rrb- already laid down or under construction .

the gas pumped through the langeled pipeline will cover up to 20 percent of britain 's needs in coming years .
the scandinavian country already supplies 30 percent of france 's needs and 25 percent of germany 's . " due to the fact that consumption of gas is increasing in europe ... there is a clear increased interest for norwegian supply of gas and therefore we 're increasing our production and exports , " norwegian oil and energy minister odd roger enoksen told afp .
eu change of heart from 50 billion cubic meters in 2000 , exports are expected to swell to 130 billion cubic meters in 2010 . the rise is warmly welcomed by european countries keen to ensure secure energy supplies and diversify their suppliers beyond russia , which meets 25 percent of europe 's gas needs . a " gas war " between moscow and kiev in the dead of winter a year ago illustrated europe 's vulnerability : russia turned off the taps to ukraine after a dispute over prices , leading to knock-on disruption of supplies across europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia turned off ukraine gas last winter " norway has been an important actor in the gas sector for a long time and will remain so .
but it is brussels ' perception of norway that has changed , " said an analyst at enskilda securities , arnstein wigestrand . the eu previously objected to norway 's practice of signing long-term supply agreements , urging suppliers and clients on the continent to review the terms of their contracts to ensure smoother gas supplies to the market , he recalled . " but now the eu has changed its stance .
in brussels , they must be rubbing their hands in glee for each cubic meter that the norwegians are delivering , " the analyst said .
no russian-norwegian competition , oil minister says russia recently signed a memorandum of understanding on gas cooperation with algeria , the eu 's third biggest supplier with an 11 percent market share , raising fears of a possible gas cartel .
the possibility of an " opec for gas " appears very hypothetical , but norway has already ruled out participating in such a group .

"
this was n't a prediction brought on by a visit to a fortune teller or an arrogant statement before a match against the currently most woeful side in the bundesliga , but a sly dig at germany 's highest court which had enforced a ban on bremen 's sponsor , online betting firm bwin.com. whether bremen will win their next challenge , one in court rather than on the soccer field , is another matter .
battering bottom-of-the-league bochum is one thing , taking on the federal constitutional court is another . but that is exactly what bremen intends to do .
the bundesliga leaders have filed a complaint to the court in an attempt to overturn the ban and have bwin returned to the chests of klose , frings and co .

gambling is a state monopoly in france and online betting firms are banned from seeking clients on french territory . bwin is just one of the online commercial betting firms which are facing opposition throughout europe as countries look to protect their own national gambling interests . competition law infringements investigated the practice of banning online commercial betting firms is under investigation by the european commission , which believes that nations which restrict their gambling markets are infringing on competition regulations . the commission has recently sought information from france and italy on sports and online betting and from austria on the casino industry .

buyers , it seems , prefer trendy art fairs to stuffy old galleries or even click onto ebay for their monet or manet . gallery owners are perhaps the most influential players in the game of art , where the stakes end in a long line of zeros and subjectivity is the rule .
non-commercial institutions like museums , art societies and critics are important as well .
after all , they set the trends and tip market values by increasing the name recognition of certain artists . " it depends on how much they 're able to influence the right people and affect their opinion about the products .
networking between galleries , artists , critics and institutions plays a big role in this , " said cologne gallery owner rolf hengesbach . these networks are particularly dense in germany , he added , which has led to a strong development of the art market . art market profits from decentralized system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a sale is the " target , " as is the title of this work by john m armleder another plus for the german art market is the country 's federalist system .
unlike france or england , germany has many centers of art , which enhances regional diversity . in a centralized art market , one leading institution - such as an important museum in the country 's art capital - would control trade .
but in germany a diverse collection of museums with varying structures and styles are involved . the competition that comes from pluralism has been quite fruitful , said hengesbach . in terms of the sheer number of galleries , art fairs and public art institutions , germany takes a close second to the us .
measured per capita , the german art market is head and shoulders above all the rest , according to the web site artfacts.net. however , the exact number of art galleries in germany is rather vague .
depending on how they 're defined , the figure varies from 1,300 to 2,000 . art fairs crucial to networking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dwarves in ottmar hörl 's installation " secret bearers " kept their lips sealed at " art karlsruhe " while galleries bear the brand of tradition , art fairs - which entered the playing field some 40 years ago - are the fresher marketing approach . " art cologne " was long considered a forerunner in the art fair world , but its significance has dimmed in recent years as new fairs in berlin and london - as well as old faithful in basel - have stolen the show .
a new fair has also been founded in karlsruhe , and düsseldorf is next on the list . while galleries are complaining of fewer and fewer visitors , art fairs are opening their doors to a readily increasing number of enthusiasts .
many gallery owners have responded by participating in fairs themselves , where they gain more than just sales . " art fairs are there to make contacts , get to know new collectors and curators and to do business with colleagues that place artists in other galleries , " said susanne zander , deputy chairwoman of the federal association of german galleries .
" art fairs are incredibly important . " internet virtualizes art trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet makes buying art a bit more comfortable naturally , a functioning art market ca n't do without paying customers .
there 's always the deliberate collector and the classic gallery visitor .
but more and more , spontaneous buyers are also pulling out their pocketbooks at art fairs . the internet has added yet another twist to the art of selling art .
not only have virtual galleries sprung up that function entirely over the net , but some traditional gallery owners are also finding themselves selling via e-mail to buyers they 've never met . the german art market may be flooded with a diverse collection of dealers , but to maintain a competitive edge on the global market gallery owners will have to become more professional , said zander .

the gas pumped through the langeled pipeline will cover up to 20 percent of britain 's needs in coming years .
the scandinavian country already supplies 30 percent of france 's needs and 25 percent of germany 's . " due to the fact that consumption of gas is increasing in europe ... there is a clear increased interest for norwegian supply of gas and therefore we 're increasing our production and exports , " norwegian oil and energy minister odd roger enoksen told afp .
eu change of heart from 50 billion cubic meters in 2000 , exports are expected to swell to 130 billion cubic meters in 2010 . the rise is warmly welcomed by european countries keen to ensure secure energy supplies and diversify their suppliers beyond russia , which meets 25 percent of europe 's gas needs . a " gas war " between moscow and kiev in the dead of winter a year ago illustrated europe 's vulnerability : russia turned off the taps to ukraine after a dispute over prices , leading to knock-on disruption of supplies across europe .

but it is brussels ' perception of norway that has changed , " said an analyst at enskilda securities , arnstein wigestrand . the eu previously objected to norway 's practice of signing long-term supply agreements , urging suppliers and clients on the continent to review the terms of their contracts to ensure smoother gas supplies to the market , he recalled . " but now the eu has changed its stance .
in brussels , they must be rubbing their hands in glee for each cubic meter that the norwegians are delivering , " the analyst said .
no russian-norwegian competition , oil minister says russia recently signed a memorandum of understanding on gas cooperation with algeria , the eu 's third biggest supplier with an 11 percent market share , raising fears of a possible gas cartel .
the possibility of an " opec for gas " appears very hypothetical , but norway has already ruled out participating in such a group . " for a large quantity of our production we have long-term contracts , and we are part of the european economic area agreement and we have liberalized and opened up our gas supply completely , so we have no intention of going in that direction , " enoksen said .

otherwise , if you do n't do what 's needed to have a secure supply of gas , the consuming countries can change from gas to other energy sources , " he said . with the langeled pipeline just freshly in place , norway is already looking to build a new gas pipeline to europe to add to the 7,800 kilometers -lrb- 4,850 miles -rrb- already laid down or under construction .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former defense minister struck suggested it was time to end the mission in bosnia it was kosovo that prompted germany to break with a postwar taboo on sending its troops into combat when it contributed to the nato aerial bombing campaign in the serbian province in 1999 . this month marked another break with the past as the german navy took command of the marine component of the un force in lebanon in germany 's first military foray into the middle east since world war ii .
the mission got off to a rocky start when six israeli warplanes confronted an unarmed german ship and a helicopter backing up marines in the mediterranean .

a heated debate has erupted at home , both about the germans ' restricted mandate in lebanon and the risk that they could clash with israeli soldiers - a possibility that is viewed uneasily in germany and israel because of the nazis ' persecution of the jews . germany chose not to send ground troops to the lebanon peacekeeping force because of that risk .

" even if we have the support of parliament , many deputies feel that we have reached the limit .
we should practice restraint , " jung told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
" until now we have failed to accompany the growing number of foreign military missions with a proper debate about their meaning and purpose , " he added . jung 's remarks contrasted sharply with a white paper on defense he submitted to cabinet on wednesday which paves the way for germany to increase the number of peacekeepers abroad from about 10,000 to up to 14,000 .
macabre photos but as the minister unveiled the document , the country 's biggest-selling newspaper bild ran photographs showing german soldiers in afghanistan in sometimes obscene poses with human skulls . two soldiers have been suspended so far in the scandal that has rattled a nation and an army that has worked hard for six decades to redeem its image after the nazi horrors of world war ii .
the pictures in afghanistan , taken in 2003 , seem to have been the tip of the iceberg after more macabre images appeared in the media , taken at different times and in different parts of the strife-torn country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bild " published the first photos wednesday a senior army psychologist said in an interview with bild am sonntag newspaper that german soldiers serving in kosovo had taken similar photographs . " i found out in kosovo that young soldiers were taking photographs of exhumations and autopsies which found their way into the barracks , " horst schuh told the newspaper .
" some soldiers are strangely attracted by the macabre . " is deployment justified ? former defense minister peter struck , now the parliamentary leader of the social democrats , said it was time germany brought home some of its men serving abroad , of whom 2,800 are part of the nato-led force in afghanistan . " one always has to ask yourself whether a deployment is still justified , " said struck , who was minister at the time the soldiers took the pictures in afghanistan but has denied knowing of them then .
" the war in bosnia ended 11 years ago , but we still have a big contingent there .
we should be getting to the point where we can withdraw , " struck told bild am sonntag . struck said the german contingent in kosovo should also be reduced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former defense minister struck suggested it was time to end the mission in bosnia it was kosovo that prompted germany to break with a postwar taboo on sending its troops into combat when it contributed to the nato aerial bombing campaign in the serbian province in 1999 . this month marked another break with the past as the german navy took command of the marine component of the un force in lebanon in germany 's first military foray into the middle east since world war ii .
the mission got off to a rocky start when six israeli warplanes confronted an unarmed german ship and a helicopter backing up marines in the mediterranean .
merkel naive ?
a heated debate has erupted at home , both about the germans ' restricted mandate in lebanon and the risk that they could clash with israeli soldiers - a possibility that is viewed uneasily in germany and israel because of the nazis ' persecution of the jews . germany chose not to send ground troops to the lebanon peacekeeping force because of that risk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a mandate to patrol the lebanese coast the opposition has accused conservative chancellor angela merkel of misleading parliament in a bid to win its approval for the mission , while the press said she was naive to believe germany could avoid all confrontation with israeli forces . the lebanon mission has not been popular with the public , nor has merkel 's decision to send german troops to lead the european force that was sunday monitoring presidential elections in the strife-torn democratic republic of congo . under the headline " the home front is divided , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said the skull scandal has made any extension of the mandate of the drc mission unlikely . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear a german newspaper on saturday published more photographs showing soldiers posing with human skulls and bones in afghanistan as pressure mounted on the government to find the culprits .

but werder bremen remain the most impressive bundesliga side so far this season . khedira , 19 , playing in only his fourth top flight game since being promoted from the club 's amateur team , volleyed home from 20 meters in the 32nd and tapped in from short range seconds into the second half . tasci , also 19 years of age , wrapped up matters from short range in the 75th . " it was a great feeling .
we had respect for schalke but after the second goal the game was ours , " said khedira , who is fighting for a new contract at the club . tasci said : " the whole team played really well , not just the youngsters .
we now hope to stay in the upper regions of the standings . " stuttgart are unbeaten in seven matches and moved within four points of leaders werder bremen .
schalke could have drawn even with bremen , but instead rank third behind the northern germans and champions bayern munich .
bielefeld moves up bremen have 19 points , munich and schalke are locked on 16 ahead of their showdown next weekend at schalke , stuttgart have 15 , and arminia bielefeld rose to fifth from a 5-1 demolition of alemannia aachen in the other sunday game .

bayern even had the luxury of missing a penalty from peruvian forward claudio pizarro on the stroke of half-time . but it is bremen who are impressing most and they have bagged six goals in each of their last two away games , beating bochum 6-0 prior to last weekend 's top-of-the-table victory .
" new dimension " this win over third-from-bottom mainz was due in large part to the return to goal-scoring form of germany forward miroslav klose , who notched a brace , and the continuing mastery of brazilian playmaker diego .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is back in form " he is playing in a completely different dimension , " was the verdict from the beaten team 's management after the match . klose had gone 618 minutes without a goal but his partnership with diego is starting to click into gear , the brazilian finding a new lease on life in the bundesliga after struggling with porto in the portuguese league for the last couple of seasons . bremen now have 19 points from nine matches , three clear of bayern and schalke 04 , who travel to stuttgart on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga season 2006/07 : reports to the winter break werder bremen ahead of schalke on goal difference league leaders stuttgart face champions bayern in stiff test bremen stay top as schalke misfire at nuremberg schalke and bayern split points after bremen draw bundesliga -pipe- 29.10.2006 teenagers shine as stuttgart rout schalke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was stuttgart 's night teenagers sami khedira and serdar tasci were the heroes on sunday when vfb stuttgart beat schalke 04 3-0 .
but werder bremen remain the most impressive bundesliga side so far this season . khedira , 19 , playing in only his fourth top flight game since being promoted from the club 's amateur team , volleyed home from 20 meters in the 32nd and tapped in from short range seconds into the second half . tasci , also 19 years of age , wrapped up matters from short range in the 75th . " it was a great feeling .
we had respect for schalke but after the second goal the game was ours , " said khedira , who is fighting for a new contract at the club . tasci said : " the whole team played really well , not just the youngsters .
we now hope to stay in the upper regions of the standings . " stuttgart are unbeaten in seven matches and moved within four points of leaders werder bremen .
schalke could have drawn even with bremen , but instead rank third behind the northern germans and champions bayern munich .
bielefeld moves up bremen have 19 points , munich and schalke are locked on 16 ahead of their showdown next weekend at schalke , stuttgart have 15 , and arminia bielefeld rose to fifth from a 5-1 demolition of alemannia aachen in the other sunday game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kucera -lrb- in front -rrb- fights for the ball against aachen 's thomas stehle jonas kamper struck twice , with radim kucera , artur wichniarek and substitute christian eigler scoring the other goals for bielefeld .
reiner plasshenrich was on target for aachen .
saturday 's match between bayern and frankfurt eintracht was over as a contest by half-time at 2-1 , with goals from dutch pair roy makaay and mark van bommel .
bayern even had the luxury of missing a penalty from peruvian forward claudio pizarro on the stroke of half-time . but it is bremen who are impressing most and they have bagged six goals in each of their last two away games , beating bochum 6-0 prior to last weekend 's top-of-the-table victory .
" new dimension " this win over third-from-bottom mainz was due in large part to the return to goal-scoring form of germany forward miroslav klose , who notched a brace , and the continuing mastery of brazilian playmaker diego .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is back in form " he is playing in a completely different dimension , " was the verdict from the beaten team 's management after the match . klose had gone 618 minutes without a goal but his partnership with diego is starting to click into gear , the brazilian finding a new lease on life in the bundesliga after struggling with porto in the portuguese league for the last couple of seasons . bremen now have 19 points from nine matches , three clear of bayern and schalke 04 , who travel to stuttgart on sunday .
they could draw level on points but have no chance of overhauling bremen 's vastly superior goal difference advantage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' daniel gunkel scored the first goal against hertha berlin with a penalty kick in other games , nuremberg remain fifth after they were held 1-1 by borussia dortmund , while early pacesetters hertha berlin dropped to sixth after a disappointing 2-0 reverse at energie cottbus , the only team from the former east germany in the top flight .
cottbus moved up to fourth in the table from 11th at the start of the day . hamburg 's troubles continued as they were held 0-0 at home by hannover 96 and remain hovering over the relegation zone .
bayer leverkusen beat borussia monchengladbach 2-0 while rock bottom bochum were beaten 1-0 at home by vfl wolfsburg . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder bremen , bayern munich win champions league matches german teams werder bremen and bayern munich both won in champions league action on wednesday night , as they look ahead to a domestic face-off on the weekend .

the archbishop of canterbury has insisted faith schools are not harmful to the cohesion of society .
dr rowan williams told the bbc he welcomed the decision to scrap plans to make new faith schools take more children from other religions .
he said the government had shown there were concerns over integration " which faith schools have to play their part in resolving " .
the government has been criticised for abandoning its plans over quotas .
education secretary alan johnson said he had dropped the idea after reaching a " voluntary agreement " with churches .
but the government is now facing a battle in the house of lords over the issue .

" i think it reflects the government taking faith schools seriously in their own terms while quite properly and very naturally saying , look , there are concerns about integration , which faith schools have to play their part in resolving , " he said .
bbc religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said dr williams accepted some muslims were reluctant to participate socially and culturally in british society - but believed the government was right not to try to address this by imposing legal quotas on schools .
' path to madness ' dr williams said he also opposed any suggestion of legislation against the wearing of religious symbols .
he said the inevitable need to set legal limits over the size and style of things such as crucifixes or veils would be a " path to madness " .
mr johnson 's tory predecessor lord baker has already told the bbc he will table an amendment to the education bill this week to reinstate the quotas plan .
he accused ministers of the " fastest u-turn in british political history " .
but mr johnson has said he reached a deal with the catholic church and the church of england to " ensure " they would reserve up to a quarter of places in their schools for children of other faiths or of no faith although the voluntary agreement does not affect muslim schools , the muslim council of britain welcomed it , with education spokesman tahir allam saying the compromise was " a good position to be in " .
lord baker 's spokeswoman said the peer 's amendment , compelling new state-funded faith schools in england to take up to 25 % of pupils from outside the religion , would be tabled on monday .

brazil 's petrobras and spain 's repsol were among eight to reach agreement on saturday , after two deals on friday .
the contracts come after president evo morales nationalised the oil and gas industry in may to give the state more control and a larger slice of profits .
he said that now bolivia would no longer be " a beggar state " .
" we will continue in this path of recovering our natural resources , " said mr morales , " not only the hydrocarbons but ... all non-renewable natural resources that belong to the bolivian people . "
under the terms of the president 's 1 may decree , foreign companies had six months to sign contracts giving up majority control of their bolivian operations .
the companies will also have to work in partnership with the re-founded bolivian state energy firm , yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
companies signed up andina bg group chaco matpetrol repsol petrobras -lrb- two branches -rrb- pluspetrol total sa vintage petroleum the bbc 's damian kahya in la paz says a deal with petrobras - the largest foreign investor in the industry - came as a significant boost for mr morales as the brazilians have invested more than $ 1bn in bolivian gas .
however , petrobras and the brazilian government had been angered by the way the bolivians conducted negotiations , accusing them of bullying , our correspondent says .
deals with seven more firms , including the second largest investor spain 's repsol and the uk 's bg group , were announced a few hours ' before the deadline expired .
details of the contracts signed on friday are not yet available , but the president of ypfb , said they would bring bolivia $ 120m -lrb- £ 63m -rrb- in annual gas revenues .
' rocky ' negotiations the negotiation process has not been simple .
talks were dealt a blow in september when andres soliz rada , a main player in the nationalisation process , resigned as energy minister .
mr soliz had clashed with state-owned petrobras , the biggest investor in bolivia 's energy industry .
however , mr rada was replaced by carlos villegas , and talks proved to be more fruitful .

brazil 's petrobras and spain 's repsol were among eight to reach agreement on saturday , after two deals on friday .
the contracts come after president evo morales nationalised the oil and gas industry in may to give the state more control and a larger slice of profits .
he said that now bolivia would no longer be " a beggar state " .
" we will continue in this path of recovering our natural resources , " said mr morales , " not only the hydrocarbons but ... all non-renewable natural resources that belong to the bolivian people . "
under the terms of the president 's 1 may decree , foreign companies had six months to sign contracts giving up majority control of their bolivian operations .
the companies will also have to work in partnership with the re-founded bolivian state energy firm , yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .

mr soliz had clashed with state-owned petrobras , the biggest investor in bolivia 's energy industry .
however , mr rada was replaced by carlos villegas , and talks proved to be more fruitful .

the council said it had received 71 applications for money which had helped create 80 new jobs , and as a result funding levels for the grant were " low " .
the spokeswoman added : " the authority will look forward to replenishing resources using new european funding and its own resources in 2007/08 , and will consider whether it is possible to give support for the remainder of this year . "

the local authority has awarded £ 77,500 to 71 new companies since the start of the new financial year in april .
an increase in demand for the grant means the council may not be able to issue more money until next year .
businesswoman kristina jackson , from aberporth , claims she was told not to apply for a grant as money had run out .
mother-of-two mrs jackson is setting up an online directory with a business partner in cardigan .
" i had wanted to apply for £ 2,000 , but was told it was n't worth applying because there were no more funds available until 2008 , " said mrs jackson .
" this will leave my business and a lot of others in a very tricky situation .
i had wanted to buy a lap-top computer and office furniture with the grant . "
ceredigion council said the start-up grants scheme had been successful .

city mayor douglas madge wants it to develop into an annual carnival .
he said people were friendly but reserved but something as simple as a smile could " make a difference " to someone moving to the area .
the free event at the penrhyn hall included performances from a local samba group and and community choir .
mr madge has personal experience of moving to the city from outside .
welsh children he came to the university at bangor from india - although he is british by birth - to work as a photographer in 1962 .
if you smile and maybe say hello enough times people will feel they are being recognised douglas madge , mayor of bangor " it was tough , and i felt very isolated , " he said .
mr madge later married a woman from caernarfon and their three children speak welsh .
" people are not unfriendly here , but they are reserved , and a smile makes a difference .
" if you smile and maybe say hello enough times people will feel they are being recognised , " he said .
saturday 's event focussed on allowing people to meet and exchange information and enjoy displays including african drums , a choir and polish dancers .
in tandem , a committee has been set to allow people from the other nationalities to " have a voice " .
" the city council deal with planning applications mostly thinking about the white community never about people who have emigrated here , but its important to hear their voice , " said mr madge .
the event has already resulted in one new friendship .
abdul-aziz barazi from syria saw an article about the event in a local newspaper and contacted mr madge offering his help .
there was music from a variety of styles " my work involves helping immigrant people to set up in business so they are self-sufficient and i thought this event was such a good idea , " said mr barazi .
" there is a sense of isolation and helplessness when people first come here , they feel ignored and unrecognised . "
media coverage focusing on a certain group of people often caused insecurity he said and the event in bangor should help to alleviate this .
" people have chosen to make this place their home and it is important for them to feel at home , " he said .
" the fear factor comes from ignorance . "
the welsh people were " an inspiration " , he said , to people who moved here to live because they were standing up for themselves and fighting to save their language .
he said the bangor event was " completely informal " .
" with the progress of technology the world is getting smaller and this diversity brings strength , " he added .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- is calling for a " private right to copy " .
it would decriminalise millions of britons who break the law each year by copying their cds onto music players .
making copies of cds and dvds for personal use would have little impact on copyright holders , the ippr argues .
copyright issues have , in the past , been steered too much by the music industry , the report said .
public respect ippr deputy director dr ian kearns said : " when it comes to protecting the interests of copyright holders , the emphasis the music industry has put on tackling illegal distribution and not prosecuting for personal copying , is right .

most computers will open pdfs , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
according to research from the national consumer council , more than half of british consumers are infringing copyright law by copying cds onto their computers , ipods or other mp3 players .
report author kay withers said : " the idea of all-rights reserved does n't make sense for the digital era and it does n't make sense to have a law that everyone breaks .
to give the ip regime legitimacy it must command public respect . "
intellectual property laws are currently being reviewed by the government .
chancellor gordon brown has asked chairman sir andrew gowers to report his findings back ahead of the pre-budget report in november .
the ippr is hoping to influence this with its report , entitled public innovation : intellectual property in a digital age .
its key recommendation is that any policy regarding intellectual property policy should recognise that knowledge is a public resource first and a private asset second .
social glue the so-called knowledge economy is growing fast as the traditional manufacturing of goods is replaced by more intangible assets .

" knowledge must , therefore , perform the roles of both commodity and social glue , both private property and public domain , " it adds .
the report looks at how digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- technologies - which restrict the sharing of music or other intellectual property - are affecting attempts to preserve electronic content .
it argues that the british library should be given a drm-free copy of any new digital work and that libraries should be able to take more than one copy of digital work .
ms withers said : " we charge the british library as being the collective memory of the nation and increasingly it has to archive digital content .
" more and more academic journals are delivered digitally but copyright laws are n't designed to deal with digital content . "
she said there was often a conflict between drm and accessibility technologies which needs to be addressed .
" someone with poor sight may use a screen reader technology and may have to change the format of the content to use it but some drm technology is n't sophisticated enought to take this kind of thing into account , " she said .
the report also calls for the government to reject calls from the uk music industry to extend the copyright term for sound recording beyond the current 50 years .

it would decriminalise millions of britons who break the law each year by copying their cds onto music players .

the father of the three-year-old girl from cardiff , abducted by convicted paedophile sweeney , made the complaint .
sweeney was jailed for life in june 2006 after admitting four charges of kidnap and three of sexual assault .
the complaint will initially be investigated by south wales police 's professional standards department .
an ipcc spokesperson said : " i can confirm that the ipcc has received a further complaint against south wales police from the father of the three-year old girl abducted by craig sweeney .
' monstrous ' " this will be processed in the usual way and will be forwarded to south wales police . "
a south wales police spokesman said its professional standards department " have been made aware of a complaint made in relation to this case , but it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this time " .
in july , a complaint about the speed with which south wales police responded to the abduction of the girl was partially upheld .
the ipcc said officers may have been able to prevent part of the three-year-old 's " terrifying ordeal " .
sweeney took the child from her cardiff home in january and seriously sexually assaulted her .
he had just finished a period of being on licence after early release from prison for indecently assaulting another child , aged six .
describing sweeney 's crime as " monstrous " , ipcc wales commissioner tom davies said had there been prompt and appropriate action by officers , part of the child 's ordeal may have been prevented .
chief constable barbara wilding said in july that the report 's recommendations would be carefully considered and apologised to the child and her family for letting them down .
