israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a train station in the northern israeli city of haifa which was damaged by hezbollah rocket attacks rice : no temporary truce us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is accompanying bush in st petersburg , rejected calls for a temporary truce , arguing that failing to address the underlying causes of the conflict might make things worse .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .
the embassy in beirut is assisting all germans who approach us , " a spokeswoman said . there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.07.2006 former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group encourages others to speak out against right-wing extremism former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism . for the first time since he left office 10 months ago , former german chancellor gerhard schröder made a public appearance this week in berlin .
he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen !

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "

" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.07.2006 retrospective on " hitler 's favorite sculptor " stirs debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curator of the schleswig-holstein-haus will show 70 of breker 's works a retrospective on arno breker will open in schwerin on july 22 .
but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .

israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "

israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

" those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union . " we support the principles of the energy charter and the efforts to participating countries to improve international energy cooperation , " the leaders said . the leaders ' statement on energy was accompanied by a detailed action plan focusing on seven main areas including promotion of energy market transparency , stability and predictability in energy markets and making investment easier . the statement also backed plans suggested by moscow to create international centers in russia to produce nuclear fuel for countries with atomic power plants and a us plan to create a multilateral nuclear fuel bank .
all of these would be under the supervision of the un nuclear watchdog , iaea . " we intend to make additional joint efforts to ensure reliable access to low enriched uranium for power reactor fuel and spent fuel recycling , " as part of the group 's joint non-proliferation efforts , the text said . " humanity is dancing on a volcano " the summit 's statement on climate change said the g8 intends " to meet our shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , improving the global environment , enhancing energy security and cutting air pollution in conjunction with our vigorous efforts to reduce poverty . " but it also highlights the divide over the 1997 kyoto protocol on climate change , saying that " those of us committed to making the kyoto protocol a success underline the importance we attach to it . " us president george w. bush rejected the draft kyoto treaty in 2001 on grounds that its binding commitments on reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too costly for the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac urged g8 members to adopt the kyoto protocol french president jacques chirac on sunday urged g8 members to apply the protocol in order to protect the planet . " we can not discuss energy security while standing still on climate change , " chirac told the leaders of britain , canada , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia at their summit here .
" humanity is dancing on a volcano . " chirac described the kyoto protocol , which took effect in february last year , as " only a first step . " " i regret that the united states is not taking part .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the section of the statement on nuclear energy says . " those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union . " we support the principles of the energy charter and the efforts to participating countries to improve international energy cooperation , " the leaders said . the leaders ' statement on energy was accompanied by a detailed action plan focusing on seven main areas including promotion of energy market transparency , stability and predictability in energy markets and making investment easier . the statement also backed plans suggested by moscow to create international centers in russia to produce nuclear fuel for countries with atomic power plants and a us plan to create a multilateral nuclear fuel bank .
all of these would be under the supervision of the un nuclear watchdog , iaea . " we intend to make additional joint efforts to ensure reliable access to low enriched uranium for power reactor fuel and spent fuel recycling , " as part of the group 's joint non-proliferation efforts , the text said . " humanity is dancing on a volcano " the summit 's statement on climate change said the g8 intends " to meet our shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , improving the global environment , enhancing energy security and cutting air pollution in conjunction with our vigorous efforts to reduce poverty . " but it also highlights the divide over the 1997 kyoto protocol on climate change , saying that " those of us committed to making the kyoto protocol a success underline the importance we attach to it . " us president george w. bush rejected the draft kyoto treaty in 2001 on grounds that its binding commitments on reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too costly for the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac urged g8 members to adopt the kyoto protocol french president jacques chirac on sunday urged g8 members to apply the protocol in order to protect the planet . " we can not discuss energy security while standing still on climate change , " chirac told the leaders of britain , canada , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia at their summit here .
" humanity is dancing on a volcano . " chirac described the kyoto protocol , which took effect in february last year , as " only a first step . " " i regret that the united states is not taking part .
but all the others must stick to their commitments .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .

but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the section of the statement on nuclear energy says . " those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union . " we support the principles of the energy charter and the efforts to participating countries to improve international energy cooperation , " the leaders said . the leaders ' statement on energy was accompanied by a detailed action plan focusing on seven main areas including promotion of energy market transparency , stability and predictability in energy markets and making investment easier . the statement also backed plans suggested by moscow to create international centers in russia to produce nuclear fuel for countries with atomic power plants and a us plan to create a multilateral nuclear fuel bank .
all of these would be under the supervision of the un nuclear watchdog , iaea . " we intend to make additional joint efforts to ensure reliable access to low enriched uranium for power reactor fuel and spent fuel recycling , " as part of the group 's joint non-proliferation efforts , the text said . " humanity is dancing on a volcano " the summit 's statement on climate change said the g8 intends " to meet our shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , improving the global environment , enhancing energy security and cutting air pollution in conjunction with our vigorous efforts to reduce poverty . " but it also highlights the divide over the 1997 kyoto protocol on climate change , saying that " those of us committed to making the kyoto protocol a success underline the importance we attach to it . " us president george w. bush rejected the draft kyoto treaty in 2001 on grounds that its binding commitments on reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too costly for the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac urged g8 members to adopt the kyoto protocol french president jacques chirac on sunday urged g8 members to apply the protocol in order to protect the planet . " we can not discuss energy security while standing still on climate change , " chirac told the leaders of britain , canada , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia at their summit here .
" humanity is dancing on a volcano . " chirac described the kyoto protocol , which took effect in february last year , as " only a first step . " " i regret that the united states is not taking part .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a train station in the northern israeli city of haifa which was damaged by hezbollah rocket attacks rice : no temporary truce us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is accompanying bush in st petersburg , rejected calls for a temporary truce , arguing that failing to address the underlying causes of the conflict might make things worse .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ?

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a train station in the northern israeli city of haifa which was damaged by hezbollah rocket attacks rice : no temporary truce us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is accompanying bush in st petersburg , rejected calls for a temporary truce , arguing that failing to address the underlying causes of the conflict might make things worse .

" france 's le monde said israel 's response to the capture of two of its soldiers by hezbollah militants is out of proportion .
" as always , israel ... is responding by making disproportionate use of military force , in violation of international law . "
it argued that the result is an impasse in the palestinian territories , in lebanon and for israel itself , since the country can not secure the release of its soldiers or prevent the firing of rockets from gaza or southern lebanon .
belgium 's de standaard described israel 's reaction as " an act of war " and agreed that it was " completely disproportionate " . " even in wars and conflicts there are proportionate measures , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european papers say israel 's reaction has been too harsh spain 's el mundo believed israel has reason to feel threatened but added that the solution to the " terrorist provocation " does not lie in " massive indiscriminate attacks on its neighbor . "
the netherlands ' trouw said israel was in a bind .
" israel is threatening to be dragged into a conflict from which it will be difficult to withdraw , " it said .
" the experience teaches us that it 's not the terrorist movements that will lose support through israel 's actions , but rather that the hatred towards israel will increase . "
austria 's die presse said it was n't israel but rather the radical hezbollah that was primarily responsible for the lebanese malaise .
" there is no justification for the militants of the ' party of god ' kidnapping israeli soldiers : israel completely withdraw from lebanon six years ago , so it was n't an occupying force anymore , " it said .
at the same time the paper added that israel reacted too hastily .
" it would have been more sensible to wait in order to make the lebanese population and also the world more aware of hezbollah 's wrongdoing , " it contended . " middle east war looms " , read a headline in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung .it too said israel 's reaction was " disproportionate " but added that every country has the right to defend itself against attacks by terror groups .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the section of the statement on nuclear energy says . " those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union . " we support the principles of the energy charter and the efforts to participating countries to improve international energy cooperation , " the leaders said . the leaders ' statement on energy was accompanied by a detailed action plan focusing on seven main areas including promotion of energy market transparency , stability and predictability in energy markets and making investment easier . the statement also backed plans suggested by moscow to create international centers in russia to produce nuclear fuel for countries with atomic power plants and a us plan to create a multilateral nuclear fuel bank .
all of these would be under the supervision of the un nuclear watchdog , iaea .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen !

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "

chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

" france 's le monde said israel 's response to the capture of two of its soldiers by hezbollah militants is out of proportion .
" as always , israel ... is responding by making disproportionate use of military force , in violation of international law . "
it argued that the result is an impasse in the palestinian territories , in lebanon and for israel itself , since the country can not secure the release of its soldiers or prevent the firing of rockets from gaza or southern lebanon .
belgium 's de standaard described israel 's reaction as " an act of war " and agreed that it was " completely disproportionate " . " even in wars and conflicts there are proportionate measures , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european papers say israel 's reaction has been too harsh spain 's el mundo believed israel has reason to feel threatened but added that the solution to the " terrorist provocation " does not lie in " massive indiscriminate attacks on its neighbor . "
the netherlands ' trouw said israel was in a bind .
" israel is threatening to be dragged into a conflict from which it will be difficult to withdraw , " it said .
" the experience teaches us that it 's not the terrorist movements that will lose support through israel 's actions , but rather that the hatred towards israel will increase . "
austria 's die presse said it was n't israel but rather the radical hezbollah that was primarily responsible for the lebanese malaise .
" there is no justification for the militants of the ' party of god ' kidnapping israeli soldiers : israel completely withdraw from lebanon six years ago , so it was n't an occupying force anymore , " it said .
at the same time the paper added that israel reacted too hastily .
" it would have been more sensible to wait in order to make the lebanese population and also the world more aware of hezbollah 's wrongdoing , " it contended . " middle east war looms " , read a headline in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung .it too said israel 's reaction was " disproportionate " but added that every country has the right to defend itself against attacks by terror groups .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .

but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .

asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit " we can not solve problems without russia " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " europe -pipe- 16.07.2006 g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders overcame differences on the conflict to issue a joint response g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis . in a joint statement released on sunday following emergency talks in st petersburg , presidents and prime ministers of the group of eight industrialized countries urged all sides in the escalating middle east conflict to exercise restraint .
israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

" france 's le monde said israel 's response to the capture of two of its soldiers by hezbollah militants is out of proportion .
" as always , israel ... is responding by making disproportionate use of military force , in violation of international law . "
it argued that the result is an impasse in the palestinian territories , in lebanon and for israel itself , since the country can not secure the release of its soldiers or prevent the firing of rockets from gaza or southern lebanon .
belgium 's de standaard described israel 's reaction as " an act of war " and agreed that it was " completely disproportionate " . " even in wars and conflicts there are proportionate measures , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european papers say israel 's reaction has been too harsh spain 's el mundo believed israel has reason to feel threatened but added that the solution to the " terrorist provocation " does not lie in " massive indiscriminate attacks on its neighbor . "
the netherlands ' trouw said israel was in a bind .
" israel is threatening to be dragged into a conflict from which it will be difficult to withdraw , " it said .
" the experience teaches us that it 's not the terrorist movements that will lose support through israel 's actions , but rather that the hatred towards israel will increase . "
austria 's die presse said it was n't israel but rather the radical hezbollah that was primarily responsible for the lebanese malaise .
" there is no justification for the militants of the ' party of god ' kidnapping israeli soldiers : israel completely withdraw from lebanon six years ago , so it was n't an occupying force anymore , " it said .
at the same time the paper added that israel reacted too hastily .
" it would have been more sensible to wait in order to make the lebanese population and also the world more aware of hezbollah 's wrongdoing , " it contended . " middle east war looms " , read a headline in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung .it too said israel 's reaction was " disproportionate " but added that every country has the right to defend itself against attacks by terror groups .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the section of the statement on nuclear energy says . " those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.07.2006 europe looks to mediate in raging middle east conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with blair - the mideast crisis is dominating the g8 summit in russia along with other european nations , germany is attempting to de-escalate the raging middle east conflict amid fears the crisis could explode into a regional war . german weekly news magazine spiegel reported on sunday that the united states had asked merkel to speak to israeli officials and she told them that lebanon was in a fragile state and should not be destabilized . germany has acted as a mediator between israel and lebanon-based guerilla group hezbollah in the past . the german government however has not confirmed the magazine report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flaming gas station hit by israeli strikes in the southern lebanese port city of sidon israeli forces have been pounding hezbollah strongholds in lebanon since the militant organization captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight on wednesday .
around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .

what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .

but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past .

what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .

but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the section of the statement on nuclear energy says . " those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union . " we support the principles of the energy charter and the efforts to participating countries to improve international energy cooperation , " the leaders said . the leaders ' statement on energy was accompanied by a detailed action plan focusing on seven main areas including promotion of energy market transparency , stability and predictability in energy markets and making investment easier . the statement also backed plans suggested by moscow to create international centers in russia to produce nuclear fuel for countries with atomic power plants and a us plan to create a multilateral nuclear fuel bank .
all of these would be under the supervision of the un nuclear watchdog , iaea . " we intend to make additional joint efforts to ensure reliable access to low enriched uranium for power reactor fuel and spent fuel recycling , " as part of the group 's joint non-proliferation efforts , the text said . " humanity is dancing on a volcano " the summit 's statement on climate change said the g8 intends " to meet our shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , improving the global environment , enhancing energy security and cutting air pollution in conjunction with our vigorous efforts to reduce poverty . " but it also highlights the divide over the 1997 kyoto protocol on climate change , saying that " those of us committed to making the kyoto protocol a success underline the importance we attach to it . " us president george w. bush rejected the draft kyoto treaty in 2001 on grounds that its binding commitments on reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too costly for the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac urged g8 members to adopt the kyoto protocol french president jacques chirac on sunday urged g8 members to apply the protocol in order to protect the planet . " we can not discuss energy security while standing still on climate change , " chirac told the leaders of britain , canada , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia at their summit here .
" humanity is dancing on a volcano . " chirac described the kyoto protocol , which took effect in february last year , as " only a first step . " " i regret that the united states is not taking part .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .

" france 's le monde said israel 's response to the capture of two of its soldiers by hezbollah militants is out of proportion .
" as always , israel ... is responding by making disproportionate use of military force , in violation of international law . "
it argued that the result is an impasse in the palestinian territories , in lebanon and for israel itself , since the country can not secure the release of its soldiers or prevent the firing of rockets from gaza or southern lebanon .
belgium 's de standaard described israel 's reaction as " an act of war " and agreed that it was " completely disproportionate " . " even in wars and conflicts there are proportionate measures , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european papers say israel 's reaction has been too harsh spain 's el mundo believed israel has reason to feel threatened but added that the solution to the " terrorist provocation " does not lie in " massive indiscriminate attacks on its neighbor . "
the netherlands ' trouw said israel was in a bind .
" israel is threatening to be dragged into a conflict from which it will be difficult to withdraw , " it said .
" the experience teaches us that it 's not the terrorist movements that will lose support through israel 's actions , but rather that the hatred towards israel will increase . "
austria 's die presse said it was n't israel but rather the radical hezbollah that was primarily responsible for the lebanese malaise .
" there is no justification for the militants of the ' party of god ' kidnapping israeli soldiers : israel completely withdraw from lebanon six years ago , so it was n't an occupying force anymore , " it said .
at the same time the paper added that israel reacted too hastily .
" it would have been more sensible to wait in order to make the lebanese population and also the world more aware of hezbollah 's wrongdoing , " it contended . " middle east war looms " , read a headline in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung .it too said israel 's reaction was " disproportionate " but added that every country has the right to defend itself against attacks by terror groups .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

he spoke this time in a new capacity as head of a national iniative called " gesicht zeigen ! "
-lrb- show your face ! -rrb- , which acts against racism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . a response to xenophobic crime in response to a series of violent crimes by right-wing extremists in the early 1990s , schröder 's former spokesman uwe-karsten heye founded " gesicht zeigen ! " in 2000 .
he was aided in the endeavor by paul spiegel , former president of the central council of jews in germany , who passed away in april 2006 . heye said schröder had always made sure that programs to battle right-wing extremism were always well-funded by the government . " i think that demonstrates that the society , and its political representatives , have a clear picture of where tolerance for intolerance should end , " said heye . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's predecessor is deceased former president johannes rau shoes too big to fill ? schröder 's predecessor as head of " gesicht zeigen ! " was johannes rau , who served as federal president during the former chancellor 's term .
the organization needed some time after rau 's death in january 2006 to reorient and find a suitable successor . " it is a great joy for me to be able to continue the work of two really great democrats , " commented schröder , referring to rau and spiegel . tempering positive world cup impressions of tolerance schröder was encouraged that the world cup had given germany the opportunity to show itself to the world as an open , tolerant country . " those who went abroad during the world cup , as i did , sensed that an entirely new view of germany had developed , " said schröder .
" now it 's important to continue implementing what became visible to others in everyday life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned again against no-go-areas founder and chairman uwe-karsten heye 's view of the current situation in germany was a bit more sober than schröder 's : " there are places where people with darker skin - african-germans and african-europeans - should n't go , " he said , repeating the warning he had made several weeks before the world cup . heye said he felt it was necessary to refer to the so-called no-go-areas again , since he had the impression that the issue had been ignored since the furor surrounding it died down days ahead of the world cup . diversity in programming one of the most visible projects " gesicht zeigen ! " sponsors is an annual , one-week campaign against racism , which coincided this year in march with the united nations ' international day for the elimination of racial discrimination . sophia oppermann , the organization 's managing director , explained that a bilateral discussion series in cooperation with five different embassies is another key element of their program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer championships have also provided an arena to speak out against racism yet another highlight was a four-year exchange between foreigners living in berlin and german students , she added . " the berlin immigrants went to high schools and vocational schools in the brandenburg area to talk with the students about a particular topic , " said oppermann .
" the classes were then invited to berlin for an inter-cultural tour of the city , a visit to a mosque , and other things .

what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .

then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .

but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past .

" those of us who have or are considering plans relating to the use and / or development of safe and secure nuclear energy believe that its development will contribute to global energy security , while simultaneously reducing harmful air pollution and addressing the climate change challenge , " it says . it includes a phrase german officials said was important to berlin , which has committed to a phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s : " we are committed to further reduce the risks associated with the safe use of nuclear energy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-nuclear demonstrators in france though nuclear energy is making a comeback in several parts of the world and has been hailed as being non-polluting , critics , particularly in germany , say the problem of storing dangerous nuclear waste ca n't be easily solved . many also point out that nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and contribute to an increase risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . " open energy markets " the g8 countries including russia also recognized several key ideas for the functioning of global energy markets , including the principle that they be " open , transparent , efficient and competitive , " the leaders ' statement said . " energy is essential to improving the quality of life and opportunities in developed and developing nations , " the leaders ' statement said .
" ensuring sufficient , reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals is a challenge for our countries and for mankind as a whole , " it added . the g8 leaders also expressed their support in principle for the european energy charter , a framework of rules that russia has so far refused to sign despite increasing admonitions to do so from the european union . " we support the principles of the energy charter and the efforts to participating countries to improve international energy cooperation , " the leaders said . the leaders ' statement on energy was accompanied by a detailed action plan focusing on seven main areas including promotion of energy market transparency , stability and predictability in energy markets and making investment easier . the statement also backed plans suggested by moscow to create international centers in russia to produce nuclear fuel for countries with atomic power plants and a us plan to create a multilateral nuclear fuel bank .
all of these would be under the supervision of the un nuclear watchdog , iaea .

" humanity is dancing on a volcano " the summit 's statement on climate change said the g8 intends " to meet our shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , improving the global environment , enhancing energy security and cutting air pollution in conjunction with our vigorous efforts to reduce poverty . " but it also highlights the divide over the 1997 kyoto protocol on climate change , saying that " those of us committed to making the kyoto protocol a success underline the importance we attach to it . " us president george w. bush rejected the draft kyoto treaty in 2001 on grounds that its binding commitments on reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too costly for the us economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac urged g8 members to adopt the kyoto protocol french president jacques chirac on sunday urged g8 members to apply the protocol in order to protect the planet .

israel must end the bombing of lebanon and both hezbollah and hamas must cease all rocket attacks on israel , the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states said .
at the same time , they they also demanded the safe return of israeli soldiers captured by militant groups and the release of arrested palestinian ministers and lawmakers .
urging israel " to exercise utmost restraint , " the statement demanded " an end to israeli military operations -lrb- in lebanon and gaza -rrb- and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza . "
" we wo n't let ourselves be divided , " german chancellor angela merkel said at the g8 summit , referring to the struggle to come up with a unified response to the crisis at the summit given the differing views of the conflict among the members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said g8 leaders " wo n't be divided " the joint statement shows that the g8 will not allow " terrorist forces and those who support them to create chaos , " merkel said .
asked whether she believed that there was a real chance for peace in the middle east , merkel said : " we hope that that 's understood . "
israel launched its assault wednesday to secure the freedom of three of its soldiers held by hezbollah and the palestinians and to bring an end to rocket attacks on its territory .
israel has pounded hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , targeting key infrastructure .
the air and ground raids have claimed more than 100 lives in lebanon , most of them civilians .
but as both hezbollah and the armed wing of hamas , one of three palestinian groups holding an israeli serviceman , have ties to iran and syria , there are fears the conflict could spread beyond lebanon and gaza .
bush , blair push to address root cause of conflict israel 's relentless military offensive against the shiite hezbollah movement in lebanon and palestinian militants in the gaza strip exposed differences among the world 's major powers earlier on sunday .
the different approaches became apparent when us president george w. bush insisted that israel " has every right to defend itself against terrorist activity " but should be " mindful of the consequences , " notably to the civilian population of lebanon and its fragile government .
following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , bush then went on to talk of root causes .
" one of the interesting things about this recent flare-up is that it helps clarify the root cause of instability in the middle east and ...
hezbollah 's relationship with syria and hezbollah 's relationship with iran and syria 's relationship with iran , " he said .
" therefore , in order to solve this problem , it 's really important for the world to address the root cause . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at an apartment building in beirut flattened during an israeli attack blair seemed to agree when he told bbc television in a separate interview that there was an " arc of extremism " across the middle east and the world would rue the consequences of failing to resolve the burning issues there .
" the only way we 're going to get anything done in this situation both in respect of what 's happening in gaza and in respect of lebanon is if we deal with the underlying causes that are giving rise to that , " blair said .
" and that means , one , that we sort out a situation between israel and palestine when you can get back into negotiating a two-state solution , " he said .
" then secondly that we remove the influence of hezbollah to disrupt both the prospects in the lebanon and the prospects in the wider region . "
russia , france criticize israeli offensive but bush 's comments contrasted with those of summit host and russian president vladimir putin , who late saturday said israel appeared to be pursuing objectives beyond the return of its soldiers .
" we condemn all terrorist acts that involve kidnapping people , " putin said .
" but we have the impression that ... israel is pursuing other , wider objectives . "
after his bilateral talks with blair on sunday , bush conferred with french president jacques chirac , who insisted that those " who jeopardize the security , stability and sovereignty of lebanon must be stopped , " leaving it vague as to which measures he had in mind .
chirac called for " the protection of civilians , moderation and a durable ceasefire " in lebanon and the gaza strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a train station in the northern israeli city of haifa which was damaged by hezbollah rocket attacks rice : no temporary truce us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is accompanying bush in st petersburg , rejected calls for a temporary truce , arguing that failing to address the underlying causes of the conflict might make things worse .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

around 100 lebanese , all but a handful of them civilians , have been killed in the air and ground strikes , which israel has said could continue for weeks or months , until hezbollah 's ability to fire rockets into israel is destroyed . the escalating conflict has sparked fears of full-out war . merkel speaks with jordan 's king abdullah the german government said merkel spoke with jordan 's king abdullah on sunday afternoon from st petersburg where she is attending a group of eight summit . " the german chancellor and the foreign minister , along with their counterparts from other eu countries , are having numerous conversations , including with representatives of israel and the arab countries , " a statement said . " the conversations are aimed at contributing to a de-escalation of the situation and stabilizing the lebanese government , " it said . european leaders could mediate the middle east crisis is dominating the g8 summit and several leaders have expressed concern at the escalating violence . italian state television reported on sunday that prime minister romano prodi was mediating in the conflict .
it said that israeli prime minister ehud olmert had conveyed to the lebanese government via prodi the conditions for an end to the israeli offensive .
they include the release of the two kidnapped israeli soldiers and the withdrawal of hezbollah from southern lebanon . iran and syria must demonstrate that they are trying to ease the escalating crisis in the middle east , british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman said at the summit on sunday . " people know the links between iran and syria and the extremists in this situation , " the spokesman said , referring to the militant lebanese shiite movement hezbollah . " therefore , all countries in the region have to play their part in calming the situation down , " he said .
" it is up to iran and syria to show that that is what they are doing . " german foreign minister steinmeier , who has said he understand israel 's need for self-defense but has criticized the country 's strikes against lebanese infrastructure targets as not a " necessary reaction , " said in a statement that he had spoken by telephone with lebanese prime minister fouad siniora on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has been talking to his arab counterparts to defuse the situation he said the two had agreed that all efforts must be directed towards an easing of the situation .
steinmeier also underlined the importance of the mediating efforts of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who was expected to begin negotiating with the warring sides on saturday . steinmeier also said he had been in intensive talks in recent days with officials in the region , including the foreign ministers of israel , egypt and syria . critics question german mediation but some doubt germany 's ability to mediate in the current mideast conflict . germany enjoys a good reputation in the region and would do everything to contribute towards de-escalation , said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy expert of the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" but this time mediation will be difficult because both the palestinian and lebanese camps lack partners who are ready and able to exercise considerable influence on the terrorists , " he warned . von klaeden added that cause and effect should not be confused .
" that means , israel was attacked and has the right to defend itself , " he told german newspaper passauer neuen presse . elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee called for a joint mediation trip to the region by the foreign ministers of the united states and russia along with solana and a high-ranking un representative . " the americans are n't trusted by the palestinians , the russians do n't have credibility with the israelis and the europeans are trusted only to an extent , " brok told german paper b.z .
" but all of them together could stand for a security guarantee and could thus manage to broker a solution successfully . " minister slams israeli strikes as the violence continues to simmer on the israel-lebanon border , criticism is mounting in germany about israel 's response . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said sunday that israel 's attacks on civilian targets in lebanon were " completely unacceptable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evacuees from lebanon disembark from a spanish plane near madrid " the fact that civilian targets and civilians in another state are being bombarded is against international law and completely unacceptable , " the minister was quoted as saying in sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper . wieczorek-zeul said israel should " do everything possible to protect the civilian population , " and also criticised its raids on the gaza strip , aimed at retrieving an abducted soldier and halting rocket attacks . she said the situation in gaza was " particularly bad for the palestinian population , who are in a dire humanitarian situation . "
but she also called on the palestinian government and the militant shiite movement hezbollah " to do everything possible to ensure the captured israeli soldiers are freed and to stop firing rockets at israel . " wieczorek-zeul criticized the united states for blocking a proposed united nations security council resolution calling on israel to end its offensive against lebanon . " how can we call on the security council to resolve other problems in a credible manner when they stop the body from acting when the middle east conflict threatens to explode ? " she asked . germans leave lebanon meanwhile , about 100 germans living in lebanon have left the country for syria , the german foreign ministry said on saturday . the ministry said the germans started heading for the syrian border in convoys on friday . # b # " we are trying to organize further help with transport .

but the show is already stirring controversy because of claims it 's an attempt to rehabilitate the artist described as hitler 's favorite sculptor . is it permissible ?
what will people think ?
these are the kind of questions asked whenever germany grapples with art from the nazi era - in this case sculptures by arno breker -lrb- 1900-1991 -rrb- , who once took commissions from adolf hitler , and whose muscle-bound classical nudes contributed to the nazi aesthetic . the schleswig-holstein-haus in schwerin , eastern germany plans to open a retrospective on breker 's career on july 22 .
it will be the first exhibition of breker 's work in the post-war era .
on display will be 70 sculptures from the private collection owned by breker 's widow . even in the art world , breker is a divisive figure , with some counting him among the most important sculptors of the 20th century , and others dismissing him as a nazi sympathizer whose work has no artistic value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker 's prometheus is an example of work that reflected nazi ideals of the body without doubt , breker was among the best known sculptors of the nazi era .
he accepted commissions from the nazis betweem 1933 and 1942 , and maintained personal friendships with both adolf hitler and his key architect , albert speer .
among the works he is now most often associated with are sculptures of the female victor and the decathlete , created for berlin 's olympic stadium . renewed controversy these , as well as other sculptures commissioned by the nazis to adorn the stadium built for the 1936 olympics , became the subject of renewed controversy ahead of the recently-concluded soccer world cup .
jewish activists called - unsuccessfully - for several of the most prominent sculptures to be covered up , lest they offend guests attending matches in the stadium . originally , the breker exhibit in schwerin was to take place in 2005 , but it was postponed so as not to coincide with the 60th anniversary celebrations marking the end of wwii . but it seems there 's never an " appropriate " time to open such an exhibit : the director of schwerin 's state museum said she felt it was " negligent " to allow it to go ahead now , because of mecklenburg - western pomerania 's upcoming state elections , in which some fear the far-right npd party could win parliamentary seats . however , the curator of the schleswig-hostein-haus , rudolf conrades , defended the show , saying the whole point of the exhibition is to make breker the subject of a criticial discussion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breker made the death mask of famous german painter max liebermann " breker was one of a group of respected young sculptors , " conrades told the paper die welt .
" max liebermann supported him - breker did his death mask .
then , with the nazi era , came his classicist phase .
but even after the war , his work was still highly praised in certain circles .
even ludwig erhard and peter ludwig posed for him .
but as a whole , his post-war work is problematic . " critical discussion or rehabilitation ? the president of berlin 's academy of art , klaus staeck , has spoken out in protest against the exhibit , saying he fears it heralds the " rehabilitation of breker . "
staeck has also cancelled a planned exhibition of his own work that was to have gone on display in schwerin next year . conrades , however , espouses the view shared by many in germany , that creating taboos around anything to do with the nazi era is not helpful in a nation still struggling to come to terms with its past . " breker is part of german art history , " he said .
" the big museums have so far shied away from handling this chapter in our history , and i really believe it 's time to do this .

last updated : sunday , 16 july 2006 , 07:06 gmt 08:06 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version south west : licence pickle mike fennell the politics show south west polperro fishermen 's choir needs blessing to perform this summer the first major reform of the licensing laws in more than 30 years is beginning to have a real impact .
basically all aspects of alcohol , entertainment and late night licensing are under one roof - and they are administered by local authorities rather than by the courts .
change invariably causes difficulties but the new system has left the organisers of many public entertainments events floundering .
not to mention many vexed village hall committees ... those that run functions which would normally involve a bar .
choir affected during the summer the polperro fishermen 's choir has performed on the quayside on behalf of various charities for decades .
but this week 's event was almost scuppered by the new licensing regulations .
as a result the organisers needed to have a temporary events notice , which they should have applied for 10 days before the performance .
but they were a day late and they faced having to cancel .
but the choir 's chairman , brian young , said they found what they hoped was a loophole : " the only way round it was to find a minister to come and say a prayer and turn it into a religious event .
" luckily tonight we had a minister who could come at the last minute and save the day . "
expensive licence ?
each licence costs £ 21 - which is a big chunk out of the money the choir would otherwise give to charity , according to murray collings , who has been singing in the choir for more than 50 years : " it is going to kill many events we put on .
sometimes the collection would perhaps be £ 120 .
well take £ 21 out of that and it is not worth the choir coming , 30 men , plus the collectors coming and standing and putting on a performance . "
because of the radical changes the licensing authority , in this case , caradon council , is taking a softy softly approach .
environmental health officer , martin gregory , whose department now looks after licensing matters , said there had been confusion : " some people have been slow on the uptake , certainly those that rarely hold events or those that did not need to have licences before .
" i mean we have been using the publicity and trying to get through that side but we still know of events that have n't got the licence in place , obviously we 're chasing those up . "
volunteers not keen on being sole licensee committees bemused many village hall committees are also bemused by the new regulations .
they are no longer able to sell alcohol at more than 12 events a year , if they remain unlicensed .
fine for some , but a real struggle for larger village halls like the one at chacewater .
brenda bailey said it used to accommodate 30 to 40 events a year : " now we can only have 12 and it makes a lot of difference to fund-raising activities in the village and people who want to use this lovely hall for things like weddings , family events , 50th birthday parties and so on because they can not have a bar and sell alcohol . "
the alternative is a licence which is expensive ... and as things stand mean one named individual being responsible .
this is viewed with extreme reluctance by the volunteers who run village halls .
government relents ?
the government has indicated it is prepared to consider removing the requirement for one person to be the designated supervisor but it wo n't budge on the number of temporary events notices .
the government says that it is going to keep the limit on public entertainment licences in order to protect local residents from excessive noise , nuisance and other disturbances but they indicated the matter will kept under review .
but the justification found little support on the opposition benches .
the liberal democrat mp for truro , matthew taylor was scornful : " the idea that somebody 's going to organise a noisy all-night rave in your local village hall just does n't add up and once ministers admitted they 'd had no complaints to lead to this legislation you have to ask why they bothered with the legislation in the first place . "
a thought that has certainly crossed the minds of members of polperro 's fishermen 's choir , who now have to sing for their licence before they can even start raising money for charity .

last updated : sunday , 16 july 2006 , 07:06 gmt 08:06 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version south west : licence pickle mike fennell the politics show south west polperro fishermen 's choir needs blessing to perform this summer the first major reform of the licensing laws in more than 30 years is beginning to have a real impact .
basically all aspects of alcohol , entertainment and late night licensing are under one roof - and they are administered by local authorities rather than by the courts .
change invariably causes difficulties but the new system has left the organisers of many public entertainments events floundering .
not to mention many vexed village hall committees ... those that run functions which would normally involve a bar .
choir affected during the summer the polperro fishermen 's choir has performed on the quayside on behalf of various charities for decades .
but this week 's event was almost scuppered by the new licensing regulations .
as a result the organisers needed to have a temporary events notice , which they should have applied for 10 days before the performance .
but they were a day late and they faced having to cancel .
but the choir 's chairman , brian young , said they found what they hoped was a loophole : " the only way round it was to find a minister to come and say a prayer and turn it into a religious event .
" luckily tonight we had a minister who could come at the last minute and save the day . "
expensive licence ?
each licence costs £ 21 - which is a big chunk out of the money the choir would otherwise give to charity , according to murray collings , who has been singing in the choir for more than 50 years : " it is going to kill many events we put on .
sometimes the collection would perhaps be £ 120 .
well take £ 21 out of that and it is not worth the choir coming , 30 men , plus the collectors coming and standing and putting on a performance . "
because of the radical changes the licensing authority , in this case , caradon council , is taking a softy softly approach .
environmental health officer , martin gregory , whose department now looks after licensing matters , said there had been confusion : " some people have been slow on the uptake , certainly those that rarely hold events or those that did not need to have licences before .
" i mean we have been using the publicity and trying to get through that side but we still know of events that have n't got the licence in place , obviously we 're chasing those up . "
volunteers not keen on being sole licensee committees bemused many village hall committees are also bemused by the new regulations .
they are no longer able to sell alcohol at more than 12 events a year , if they remain unlicensed .
fine for some , but a real struggle for larger village halls like the one at chacewater .
brenda bailey said it used to accommodate 30 to 40 events a year : " now we can only have 12 and it makes a lot of difference to fund-raising activities in the village and people who want to use this lovely hall for things like weddings , family events , 50th birthday parties and so on because they can not have a bar and sell alcohol . "
the alternative is a licence which is expensive ... and as things stand mean one named individual being responsible .
this is viewed with extreme reluctance by the volunteers who run village halls .
government relents ?
the government has indicated it is prepared to consider removing the requirement for one person to be the designated supervisor but it wo n't budge on the number of temporary events notices .
the government says that it is going to keep the limit on public entertainment licences in order to protect local residents from excessive noise , nuisance and other disturbances but they indicated the matter will kept under review .
but the justification found little support on the opposition benches .
the liberal democrat mp for truro , matthew taylor was scornful : " the idea that somebody 's going to organise a noisy all-night rave in your local village hall just does n't add up and once ministers admitted they 'd had no complaints to lead to this legislation you have to ask why they bothered with the legislation in the first place . "
a thought that has certainly crossed the minds of members of polperro 's fishermen 's choir , who now have to sing for their licence before they can even start raising money for charity .

he married saskia uylenburgh in 1634 , who went on to have four children , only three of which survived past infancy .
after saskia 's death in 1642 , rembrandt went on to have relationships with his child 's nanny and then a much younger housekeeper .

he died in 1669 and was buried in a pauper 's grave .

mr blair , speaking after talks with us president george bush , said g8 leaders must " work very hard to find a common and unified position " on the situation .
the latest violence has dominated the meeting in st petersburg , russia .
mr blair said that countries such as iran and syria " do not want this process of democratisation and peace and negotiation to succeed " .
he added he was confident the leaders attending the meeting could agree a position on the situation because they had a " common position in supporting lebanon in its democracy , in supporting the security of israel , in supporting the concept of a two state solution " .
in an interview for bbc one 's the politics show , mr blair said : " though this is a difficult thing to say , and i think it has to be said , i do n't think anybody really believes that this is just about hezbollah and israel .
" we are very worried about the influence of both syria and iran in respect of this and that the only way we are going to get a calming down , a ceasefire , restraint shown on all sides is if we deal with the underlying conditions which are the reason why this conflict between israel and hezbollah has come about " .
rocket attacks early on sunday , israel began a fifth day of bombardments in lebanon as part of an operation that followed hezbollah 's capture of two israeli soldiers .
hezbollah has also launched rocket attacks on northern israel .
mr bush said : " our message to israel is defend yourself but be mindful of the consequences , so we are urging restraint . "
ahead of the talks , mr blair and his wife cherie joined leaders from russia , the us , canada , france , germany , italy and japan at an informal welcoming dinner on saturday night .
mr blair is also set to discuss the middle east with united nations secretary general kofi annan on monday , the final day of the three-day summit .
oxfam 's jo leadbeater warned violence was getting worse in darfur in sudan , despite g8 pledges to support peacekeeping efforts .
" this meeting is happening against a backdrop of rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crises which the g8 leaders must not turn their back on , " she said .
progress on africa trade in africa , security issues like iran and north korea and russian democracy are all expected to be discussed on sunday .
the following day the prime minister is due to make a presentation to fellow leaders on the progress made on pledges regarding africa at last year 's summit , which was held at gleneagles in perthshire .
mr blair has already said he would not try to bring countries into line with the kyoto protocol on climate change .
the g8 countries will be joined by delegates from nations including india , china , south africa , mexico and brazil .
anti-globalisation protests are also expected , with more than 1,000 demonstrators reported to be preparing to make their voices heard , though they will be kept miles away from the leaders .
swipe meanwhile president putin of russia has taken a swipe at mr blair over the uk 's criticism of the state of russian democracy .
asked by a british reporter for his response to london 's disappointment , mr putin told a news conference : " it will be interesting for us to hear your experience , including in connection to lord levy . "
the labour party fundraiser who was arrested last week is not exactly a household name in russia , says bbc correspondent matt frei .
he says the remarks have deepened the diplomatic faultlines at a time when the g8 leaders are frantically trying to thrash out some common language on the crisis in the middle east .
mr blair later said he doubted the issue of party fund-raising would be discussed at the summit .

mr blair , speaking after talks with us president george bush , said g8 leaders must " work very hard to find a common and unified position " on the situation .
the latest violence has dominated the meeting in st petersburg , russia .
mr blair said that countries such as iran and syria " do not want this process of democratisation and peace and negotiation to succeed " .
he added he was confident the leaders attending the meeting could agree a position on the situation because they had a " common position in supporting lebanon in its democracy , in supporting the security of israel , in supporting the concept of a two state solution " .
in an interview for bbc one 's the politics show , mr blair said : " though this is a difficult thing to say , and i think it has to be said , i do n't think anybody really believes that this is just about hezbollah and israel .
" we are very worried about the influence of both syria and iran in respect of this and that the only way we are going to get a calming down , a ceasefire , restraint shown on all sides is if we deal with the underlying conditions which are the reason why this conflict between israel and hezbollah has come about " .
rocket attacks early on sunday , israel began a fifth day of bombardments in lebanon as part of an operation that followed hezbollah 's capture of two israeli soldiers .
hezbollah has also launched rocket attacks on northern israel .
mr bush said : " our message to israel is defend yourself but be mindful of the consequences , so we are urging restraint . "
