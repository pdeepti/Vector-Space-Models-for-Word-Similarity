26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel 's popularity has increased current readership bravo 's overall circulation skyrocketed to 1.7 million after the reunification of germany in the early 1990s had many adult east germans reading the magazine , according to current deputy editor-in-chief alex gernandt .
but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "
bravo is a reflection on popular culture and youth culture in general , " said antje pfeffer of berlin 's archive of youth culture , which published a book on bravo 's 50 years .
" if there is a star that goes to no. 1 , he always appears in bravo . " elisa ung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's dossier on current media trends in germany .
conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

" we are delighted to leapfrog bremen who are a great team , " said schalke coach mirko slomka . " we had so many chances to win the game convincingly but we will take the 2-0 .
there is no point in getting carried away though as we have only played three games . " a tight game was expected but that was not the case , with schalke , inspired by their brazilian playmaker lincoln , dominating proceedings and only an exceptional display from bremen goalkeeper tim wiese kept the score line down . " we never found our game .
we were too passive and could not handle schalke , " admitted bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" tim -lrb- wiese -rrb- was great for us tonight but there were many who were n't . " kuranyi back on form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi forgotten german international kuranyi , left out of world cup squad , put schalke ahead after just seven minutes rising above cameroon international pierre wome to power in a header . it was kuranyi 's first goal since march and his explosive celebration emphasized the point . " the goal was important for me and the team , " enthused kuranyi .
" i just hope my club continue to play well and win games and then i can put myself forward for the national team . " altintop had a great chance to make it 2-0 for schalke on the hour mark but wiese raced out to block with his chest .
wiese , knocking on the international door for germany , saved his team again shortly before the interval thwarting peter lovenkrands . werder need to regroup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's goalkeeper tim wiese has had better days " we have two weeks off now and it is clear we need to do some work , " the goalkeeper said .
" i do not know what went wrong tonight but we have a great team and need to have faith in ourselves . " schalke went in 1-0 up at half-time but they could easily have held a 4-0 lead and bremen 's woeful defending will interest their champions league opponents barcelona and chelsea . altintop eased schalke 's nerves with a cool chipped finish in the 72nd minute to seal a thoroughly-deserved victory over a bremen side that looked way off champion material . reigning champions bayern munich have the chance to nudge schalke from the summit when they face fc nuremberg on saturday . both bayern and nuremberg have a maximum six points from their first two games . on sunday the other title hopeful sv hamburg , buoyed by their champions league qualification in midweek , face hertha berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed fortunes for german clubs in champions league draw bayern munich will be quietly confident , sv hamburg will fancy their chances as an underdog , and werder bremen will be cursing their luck after the european champions league draw .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel 's popularity has increased current readership bravo 's overall circulation skyrocketed to 1.7 million after the reunification of germany in the early 1990s had many adult east germans reading the magazine , according to current deputy editor-in-chief alex gernandt .
but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "
bravo is a reflection on popular culture and youth culture in general , " said antje pfeffer of berlin 's archive of youth culture , which published a book on bravo 's 50 years .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel 's popularity has increased current readership bravo 's overall circulation skyrocketed to 1.7 million after the reunification of germany in the early 1990s had many adult east germans reading the magazine , according to current deputy editor-in-chief alex gernandt .
but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "

"
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought . " the inner book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilem flusser -lrb- 1920-1991 -rrb- : communication was at the center of his philosophy flusser , who died in 1991 , described himself as a " prague jew . "
he was acquainted with many different cultures and spoke four languages : german , czech , portuguese and french .
being suspended over a complex of cultures can pull the rug out from under you , he once said . adel karasholi responded to the challenge of a divided identity by making a switch from reading the " book of the world " to reading the " book within me . " " there 's not just the perpetual struggle inside me between both poles but now there is also an embrace , " said karasholi . soraia vilela -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-serbian author turns down disputed german prize austrian writer peter handke , often criticized for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars , turned down germany 's heine prize , after politicians in the city of düsseldorf threatened to revoke the award .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .

klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .

" " islam offers no justification for such acts , " added the groups . they said muslims could have been victims in more than one sense if the plot to blow up trains outside the cities of hamm and koblenz on july 31 had succeeded .
homemade bombs planted on the trains in trolley suitcases failed to explode , averting an almost certain bloodbath . " if such an attack succeeds , we are potential victims of such attacks , along with all other citizens .

" " islam offers no justification for such acts , " added the groups . they said muslims could have been victims in more than one sense if the plot to blow up trains outside the cities of hamm and koblenz on july 31 had succeeded .
homemade bombs planted on the trains in trolley suitcases failed to explode , averting an almost certain bloodbath . " if such an attack succeeds , we are potential victims of such attacks , along with all other citizens .
but we will also be branded ' co-accused ' , " the groups said . their statement follows a call by interior minister wolfgang schäuble earlier this week on muslims to condemn the plot , which he has described as a terrorist attempt to kill countless people . two young lebanese men who have been living in germany have been arrested in connection with the plot .
one of them turned himself in to police in lebanon , where officials on friday said he had made a confession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security camera captured an image of one of the men suspected of leaving a bomb on a commuter train police are holding two more people , one in southern germany and one in lebanon , for questioning .

"
he told the bild am sonntag newspaper that muslims in german needed to become active in trying to prevent terrorist attacks . he called on muslim communities to reject extremists in their ranks and alert security officials to them .
he added during friday prayers imams should not denounce western values as morally inferior , thereby radicalizing young muslims . germany is home to about 3.4 million muslims , of whom two-thirds are of turkish origin . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two more suspects in german train bombing plot arrested police in lebanon and southern germany on friday arrested the third and fourth suspects in connection with the failed plot to blow up german passenger trains .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .

from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .

"
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought . " the inner book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilem flusser -lrb- 1920-1991 -rrb- : communication was at the center of his philosophy flusser , who died in 1991 , described himself as a " prague jew . "
he was acquainted with many different cultures and spoke four languages : german , czech , portuguese and french .
being suspended over a complex of cultures can pull the rug out from under you , he once said . adel karasholi responded to the challenge of a divided identity by making a switch from reading the " book of the world " to reading the " book within me . " " there 's not just the perpetual struggle inside me between both poles but now there is also an embrace , " said karasholi . soraia vilela -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-serbian author turns down disputed german prize austrian writer peter handke , often criticized for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars , turned down germany 's heine prize , after politicians in the city of düsseldorf threatened to revoke the award .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .

"
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought . " the inner book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilem flusser -lrb- 1920-1991 -rrb- : communication was at the center of his philosophy flusser , who died in 1991 , described himself as a " prague jew . "
he was acquainted with many different cultures and spoke four languages : german , czech , portuguese and french .
being suspended over a complex of cultures can pull the rug out from under you , he once said . adel karasholi responded to the challenge of a divided identity by making a switch from reading the " book of the world " to reading the " book within me . " " there 's not just the perpetual struggle inside me between both poles but now there is also an embrace , " said karasholi . soraia vilela -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-serbian author turns down disputed german prize austrian writer peter handke , often criticized for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars , turned down germany 's heine prize , after politicians in the city of düsseldorf threatened to revoke the award .

" we are delighted to leapfrog bremen who are a great team , " said schalke coach mirko slomka . " we had so many chances to win the game convincingly but we will take the 2-0 .
there is no point in getting carried away though as we have only played three games . " a tight game was expected but that was not the case , with schalke , inspired by their brazilian playmaker lincoln , dominating proceedings and only an exceptional display from bremen goalkeeper tim wiese kept the score line down . " we never found our game .
we were too passive and could not handle schalke , " admitted bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" tim -lrb- wiese -rrb- was great for us tonight but there were many who were n't . " kuranyi back on form bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kuranyi forgotten german international kuranyi , left out of world cup squad , put schalke ahead after just seven minutes rising above cameroon international pierre wome to power in a header . it was kuranyi 's first goal since march and his explosive celebration emphasized the point . " the goal was important for me and the team , " enthused kuranyi .
" i just hope my club continue to play well and win games and then i can put myself forward for the national team . " altintop had a great chance to make it 2-0 for schalke on the hour mark but wiese raced out to block with his chest .

" i do not know what went wrong tonight but we have a great team and need to have faith in ourselves . " schalke went in 1-0 up at half-time but they could easily have held a 4-0 lead and bremen 's woeful defending will interest their champions league opponents barcelona and chelsea . altintop eased schalke 's nerves with a cool chipped finish in the 72nd minute to seal a thoroughly-deserved victory over a bremen side that looked way off champion material . reigning champions bayern munich have the chance to nudge schalke from the summit when they face fc nuremberg on saturday . both bayern and nuremberg have a maximum six points from their first two games . on sunday the other title hopeful sv hamburg , buoyed by their champions league qualification in midweek , face hertha berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed fortunes for german clubs in champions league draw bayern munich will be quietly confident , sv hamburg will fancy their chances as an underdog , and werder bremen will be cursing their luck after the european champions league draw .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .

bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .

bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2006 non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir kaminer : " my origins are a treasure that inspire my work . "
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought .

schalke 's 2-0 win means that the royal blues sit on the summit as bayern and nuremberg prepare to challenge in the top of the table clash on saturday . while double winners bayern can do no wrong on the domestic front they were hammered 4-0 in a friendly by spanish champions barcelona on wednesday to crush confidence ahead of the nuremberg game .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel 's popularity has increased current readership bravo 's overall circulation skyrocketed to 1.7 million after the reunification of germany in the early 1990s had many adult east germans reading the magazine , according to current deputy editor-in-chief alex gernandt .
but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "
bravo is a reflection on popular culture and youth culture in general , " said antje pfeffer of berlin 's archive of youth culture , which published a book on bravo 's 50 years .
" if there is a star that goes to no. 1 , he always appears in bravo . " elisa ung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de media in the news click here for dw-world 's dossier on current media trends in germany .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

" we are delighted to leapfrog bremen who are a great team , " said schalke coach mirko slomka . " we had so many chances to win the game convincingly but we will take the 2-0 .
there is no point in getting carried away though as we have only played three games .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2006 non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir kaminer : " my origins are a treasure that inspire my work . "
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought . " the inner book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilem flusser -lrb- 1920-1991 -rrb- : communication was at the center of his philosophy flusser , who died in 1991 , described himself as a " prague jew . "
he was acquainted with many different cultures and spoke four languages : german , czech , portuguese and french .
being suspended over a complex of cultures can pull the rug out from under you , he once said . adel karasholi responded to the challenge of a divided identity by making a switch from reading the " book of the world " to reading the " book within me . " " there 's not just the perpetual struggle inside me between both poles but now there is also an embrace , " said karasholi . soraia vilela -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-serbian author turns down disputed german prize austrian writer peter handke , often criticized for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars , turned down germany 's heine prize , after politicians in the city of düsseldorf threatened to revoke the award .
-lrb- june 9 , 2006 -rrb- bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .
after all , how can the nazi extermination of six million jews be anything but tragic and unspeakable ?

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .

but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.08.2006 non-german authors bridge cultures with books in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir kaminer : " my origins are a treasure that inspire my work . "
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought . " the inner book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilem flusser -lrb- 1920-1991 -rrb- : communication was at the center of his philosophy flusser , who died in 1991 , described himself as a " prague jew . "
he was acquainted with many different cultures and spoke four languages : german , czech , portuguese and french .
being suspended over a complex of cultures can pull the rug out from under you , he once said . adel karasholi responded to the challenge of a divided identity by making a switch from reading the " book of the world " to reading the " book within me . " " there 's not just the perpetual struggle inside me between both poles but now there is also an embrace , " said karasholi . soraia vilela -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-serbian author turns down disputed german prize austrian writer peter handke , often criticized for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars , turned down germany 's heine prize , after politicians in the city of düsseldorf threatened to revoke the award .

"
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did . " scratchy sounds and goose bump words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tereza mora grew up in hungary speaking both hungarian and german many authors who have one foot in germany and the other somewhere else incorporate themes into their works such as cultural identity , intercultural interactions and being different . that 's the case with tereza mora from hungary , whose mother 's family is german-speaking so she grew up bilingual .
the protagonist in her novel " all the days , " for example , speaks 10 languages fluently but still lives at the edge of society , unable to truly communicate with anyone . the formal and aesthetic influences of a second language are another important facet of literature by so-called non-native authors .
for yoko tawada , who has lived in germany for 24 years , linguistic differences take on physical traits in her book " the stranger from the can . " " every foreign sound , every foreign glance , every foreign taste is uncomfortable on my body .
the ö-sounds dug themselves too deep into my ears and the r-sounds scratched my throat .
there were expressions that gave me goose bumps , " wrote tawada . while she associated language with the human body , the late cultural philosopher vilem flusser said that , like a new culture , " the new language gradually suppresses the native language as the structure for thought . " the inner book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vilem flusser -lrb- 1920-1991 -rrb- : communication was at the center of his philosophy flusser , who died in 1991 , described himself as a " prague jew . "
he was acquainted with many different cultures and spoke four languages : german , czech , portuguese and french .
being suspended over a complex of cultures can pull the rug out from under you , he once said . adel karasholi responded to the challenge of a divided identity by making a switch from reading the " book of the world " to reading the " book within me . " " there 's not just the perpetual struggle inside me between both poles but now there is also an embrace , " said karasholi . soraia vilela -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-serbian author turns down disputed german prize austrian writer peter handke , often criticized for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars , turned down germany 's heine prize , after politicians in the city of düsseldorf threatened to revoke the award .

" we are delighted to leapfrog bremen who are a great team , " said schalke coach mirko slomka . " we had so many chances to win the game convincingly but we will take the 2-0 .
there is no point in getting carried away though as we have only played three games . " a tight game was expected but that was not the case , with schalke , inspired by their brazilian playmaker lincoln , dominating proceedings and only an exceptional display from bremen goalkeeper tim wiese kept the score line down . " we never found our game .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .
werder won the bundesliga three years ago and last year the club was only five points behind fc bayern , the champions .
to win the championship is our main goal . bruno taitson interviewed diego ribas da cunha -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .

klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .
only during the last months , i was disappointed .
but now the most important thing is that i have found in werder bremen everything i expect from a football team and i 'm happy about the decision i took to play here . what do you think of german soccer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego surrounded by leverkusen players at the weser stadium in bremen german soccer is very fast , the passes are quick , the connection between defense and offense is very fast and normally the teams play to win .
werder bremen too have a very offensive tactic , that 's why i feel so comfortable playing here .
werder feels very much like santos fc when i used to play there . what 's the biggest difference between german and portuguese soccer ? it 's difficult to compare the two because i could be misunderstood by the portuguese .
so i would not like to compare soccer in both countries .
what i can say about the german league is that it has surprised me in a very positive way . does success at the bundesliga increase your chances of going back to the brazilian national team ? yes , definitely .
i 'm playing in a very famous league which has a solid reputation in the world .
to play for the brazilian national team has always been my main goal .
dunga -lrb- the new brazilian national coach -rrb- has called many players in order to test them .
so , i have high expectations of going back to the seleção . is werder going to win the bundesliga ? i ca n't guarantee that we are going to be champions , but i can guarantee that we have chances and that we are going to fight for that .
we know there are difficulties , but it 's possible .

german media have hailed him as the hottest new star on the bundesliga circuit .
this week , the midfielder adorned the cover of germany 's top sports magazine , kicker , who called him " lord of the ball . " dw-world : you had a very strong beginning with werder bremen .
how do you see your debut in german soccer ? it 's been marvelous so far .
we reached our first objective , which was to start the bundesliga with victories .
the first game was not easy , we won in hamburg and then won at home .
we reached six points in two difficult matches .
before the beginning of the bundesliga , we managed to win the league tournament , beating strong teams like hamburg and bayern .
so , i feel good and very comfortable here , i 'm satisfied with werder 's performance and with my personal performance as well . what 's the atmosphere like among the players at werder ? it 's very good .
the group is very united and most of the players have been playing together for a long time .
we also have some more experienced players , which is very important .
all in all , it 's an excellent group . what is it like playing together with miroslav klose , the world cup 's top scorer and a huge idol in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego hugs werder star and colleague miroslav klose it 's been great .
klose is a very efficient striker with exceptional qualities .
so far he has scored two goals in two games .
it 's very easy to get along with him on the pitch .
i have tried as much as i can to serve him with good passes because he is a player who definitely uses the opportunities he has quite well .
he will always score goals if he gets good passes . media in germany are already calling you the newest star of the bundesliga .
how do you deal with this sudden success in germany ? i 'm very happy that i have been able to please the public .
however , i make sure that i have my feet on the ground , it 's not the first time that such a thing has happened in my career .
it 's happened at santos fc -lrb- the brazilian side -rrb- and also at porto .
these compliments give me a lot of confidence and satisfaction but i know that there is still a long way ahead .
the difficulties tend to increase during the competition , but it is important to say that the compliments are a very good motivation for me . what are the werder fans like ? the fans here are fanatics .
they 're completely crazy about werder .
they 're glued to news of the club , our stadium is always full , there are always lots of people watching our practice sessions and asking for autographs .
it 's been a very close and positive relationship with the werder fans . it says on your web site that you were n't happy at fc porto .
what happened ? at fc porto i was the same player i have always been at santos fc .
the motivation was the same , the dedication during the practices and matches was the same and i never had any disciplinary problems there .
but what happened in the last 10 or 15 games was very weird , nobody could understand that .
until then i was always a starter , normally played the full 90 minutes .
and suddenly , i was not even a substitute anymore .
the coach gave me no explanation whatsoever for this decision .
it made me very sad .
however , i have to say that i left fc porto with my head held high , i was always very well treated by the fans and i had many happy moments there , and we won titles .

"
in france or england it would n't be politically correct to label authors by nationality instead of literary style .
but in germany , special prizes are awarded to authors with non-german backgrounds . " my readers are not interested in where i come from .
they like what i write .
period , " said vladimir kaminer , who immigrated to berlin from russia 16 years ago and has since published numerous books in german . though many non-german writers may vehemently oppose the " immigrant literature " tag , cultural identity issues often pop up in their works .
however , the " immigrant literature " category comes from the media , not from society , said kaminer . the annual adelbert von chamisso prize , established in 1985 , is one of many awards presented to authors whose first language is not german .
exactly which writers that applies to , however , is very flexible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaminer comically incorporates his russian roots in his " socialist cookbook " " in addition to literary quality , the change of language and culture that the author has experienced is important , " said klaus hübner , one of the organizers of the prize . some authors were born in germany but have a native language in addition to german , said hübner , naming hungarian-german author zsuzsa bank as an example .
others came to germany , austria or switzerland with their parents at a young age and grew up bilingually , like turkish-born feridun zaimoglu . german for survival and communication for kaminer and other authors , learning to writing in german was the only possibility to communicate with the outside world . " i did n't have any other choice .
i always wanted to reach a wider audience .
writing in german was the only way to do that , since i live here , " said kaminer . what kaminer saw as a practical necessity was more of a linguistic necessity for adel karasholi from syria . " early on i wrote poems in arabic , but at some point the language seemed far away from my experiences , " said the award-winning author , who came to germany in 1961 .
" i realized that to reach those people i had to use the same words and associations they did .

" " islam offers no justification for such acts , " added the groups . they said muslims could have been victims in more than one sense if the plot to blow up trains outside the cities of hamm and koblenz on july 31 had succeeded .
homemade bombs planted on the trains in trolley suitcases failed to explode , averting an almost certain bloodbath . " if such an attack succeeds , we are potential victims of such attacks , along with all other citizens .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel 's popularity has increased current readership bravo 's overall circulation skyrocketed to 1.7 million after the reunification of germany in the early 1990s had many adult east germans reading the magazine , according to current deputy editor-in-chief alex gernandt .
but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "
bravo is a reflection on popular culture and youth culture in general , " said antje pfeffer of berlin 's archive of youth culture , which published a book on bravo 's 50 years .

26 , 1956 , the first bravo hit german newsstands with marilyn monroe beaming from its cover .
today , germany 's most popular teenage magazine celebrates a half-century of stars , " starschnitts " and sex advice . a glance at bravo covers over the years is a look back at several generations of german teenage pop culture .
from elvis presley and the beatles , to britney spears and tokio hotel , bravo gave teenagers the inside gossip and the glamorous photos they craved .
the magazine was n't afraid to push the envelope , either .
in 1959 , it ran a series of photos that , over several weeks , added up to a life-sized poster of a scantily clad brigitte bardot : the first starschnitt , or " star cut . "
it was promptly censored in some parts of germany , but other star cuts soon followed .
and in 1969 , during the sexual revolution , bravo broke taboos by starting the dr. sommer sex and love advice column .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bravo 's readership is about two-thirds female bravo was coveted by many in communist east germany , which banned western publications .
berlin consultant siegfried ulrich , 56 , who grew up in east berlin , recalls getting to read bravo in high school in 1966 because he happened to sit next to the son of a bulgarian diplomat who smuggled in copies .
collecting enough issues to piece together the life-sized photos , however , proved difficult .
" i bet nobody in the east was lucky to get one of his favorites complete , " ulrich said .
elvis brought in the music bravo started as a film magazine for adults .
but it soon became clear that teenagers were reading their parents ' magazines , and so , in 1957 , bravo began calling itself " the journal of the young heart . "
elvis presley 's phenomenal popularity soon added music to bravo 's focus , and the magazine also sponsored a beatles tour in germany .
later , it wrote about abba , take that , the backstreet boys .
american stars were featured - michael jackson , jon bon jovi - as well as popular german groups like the 1980s-era the kelly family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tokio hotel 's popularity has increased current readership bravo 's overall circulation skyrocketed to 1.7 million after the reunification of germany in the early 1990s had many adult east germans reading the magazine , according to current deputy editor-in-chief alex gernandt .
but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "

but competition from other specialty magazines , the internet , even mobile phones has brought down circulation to 600,000 weekly .
bravo editors say that each magazine is passed on an average of three times , giving them a weekly readership of about 1.8 million .
the circulation tends to spike with highly popular acts such as current boy band tokio hotel , which has hiked bravo 's circulation by as much as 80,000 weekly .
but britney spears still boasts the most covers .
getting teenagers to read gernandt said it is a constant challenge to compete for the money of german teenagers , a discriminating and well-traveled lot .
he says bravo 's main competition is " not another magazine .
it 's mobile phones .
that is where the kids spend their money . "
in order to compete with other specialty magazines , bravo has begun titles like bravo girl , bravo sport and bravo screen fun .
it also has editions in eastern europe and an interactive internet site . "

by mike baker bbc news education correspondent would the old o-level prepare them better for life ahead ?
this year it was the turn of the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- to rain on the parade during gcse results week .
at least it was not the old refrain of " pass rates are up , standards must have fallen " .
instead , the cbi cast doubt on whether schools were educating young people in the so-called " functional skills " they will need in the workplace .
by this they mean skills such as : simple mental arithmetic , competence in percentages , legible handwriting , correct grammar and spelling .
publishing its concerns in the same week as 16-year-olds received their gcse results was an effective media strategy , although those celebrating their hard-earned grades may not have welcomed it .
in fact , the cbi had already won this battle .
the government agreed a while back to include functional skills within gcses from 2010 .
this has caused consternation amongst teachers , and even amongst some of the government 's own advisers , who believe gcses already test these essential skills of literacy and numeracy .
pupils ' views so who is right ?
does gcse english really prepare young people for the communication skills they need in work ?
or would we be better off going back to the old o-level ?
let 's look at some of the evidence .
ever-improving gcse results lead many to lament the o-level first , what do young people say after they have started work ?
the car manufacturer , bmw , surveyed the views of its young employees at the hams hall plant in warwickshire .
it found that two-thirds believed school had not prepared them at all well to " use the telephone to request information or answer a query " .
more than half felt they had not been prepared well for chairing a meeting , interviewing someone for a job , or reading and writing a text message .
by contrast , they thought school had prepared them well for : team-working , presenting a report , spotting a writer 's bias , writing a report , word processing , drafting and editing , using correct punctuation and spelling .
overall that seems a fairly good vote of confidence in school from this particular set of former pupils .
would we really expect school to prepare pupils for sending text messages or conducting job interviews ?
the exams so what about exams : how have they changed over the years ?
i looked at a gce o-level english language paper from 1956 .
it asked students to read a 350-word text about poverty and then summarise it in just 100 words .
candidates were also asked to identify parts of grammar such as : verbs , nouns , prepositions , adverbs and adjectival phrases .
further sections gave examples of ambiguous sentences -lrb- for example : " two girls went for a tramp on the downs " -rrb- and asked candidates to rewrite them to show the two possible meanings .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations by contrast , modern gcse english papers test students on an extensive anthology of writing that they have studied over the past two years .
it then asks them to comment on the use of language by the writers .
for example , a 2005 aqa paper asked candidates to " compare the ways " two poets presented a particular culture in two different poems .
the two exam papers could hardly be more different .
the o-level focused on literal understanding , clarity of writing , recognition of parts of speech and the dangers of ambiguity .
the gcse , by contrast , required much broader reading and more extensive writing by the candidate .
there was no requirement to identify parts of speech or to summarise meaning .
however it did require candidates to show an understanding of the writer 's message , including reading between the lines and analysis of how writers used language .
in many ways the modern exam requires more sophisticated skills .
but are we , as some argue , trying to get pupils to run before they can walk ?
is it an essential prerequisite that students know what a preposition is and are able to paraphrase , before we expect them to conduct a practical criticism exercise on a piece of literary writing ?
i suspect the answer depends on whether you regard school as a preparation for work or for something much broader .
against the gcse i asked a couple of experts for their views on the respective merits of the o-level and the gcse .
james williams is a lecturer in education at the university of sussex who , last year , taught o-levels again for a channel 4 tv programme .
despite having been a staunch defender of gcses in the past , this experience changed his mind .
he now believes parts of the o-level should be incorporated into modern exams .
he believes one of the problems of the gcse is that it now asks 16-year-olds to master skills that , in the past , were left until a-level or even university .
as he puts it , the o-level " really did test understanding " .
in english it " taught the structure of language and taught pupils how to communicate in different contexts and circumstances " .
williams ' expertise is in science education where he says the gcse breaks questions down into multiple parts , each requiring only a few words for each answer .
" i do n't feel you can communicate in such a short space , " he says .
his point is that you " only know if you understand something when you have to explain it to others " .
for the gcse for another view , i asked sue horner , head of english , language and the arts at the qualifications and curriculum authority which oversees examinations in england .
she strongly defends the gcse against charges that it does not equip students with functional literacy .
she points out that , unlike the o-level , the gcse tests students ' skills in speaking and listening , adding that employers " are saying it is really important to be able to present to others and to speak on the phone to customers " .
she is also indignant at any suggestion that the gcse does not test basics like punctuation and spelling .
one-third of the marks are allocated to these basics , she says , and it would be virtually impossible to get a grade c if you could not spell or punctuate .
she believes today 's students would find the o-level very dull and narrow .
" whereas it used to ask students to paraphrase , we now ask them to get underneath the meaning , to sort out what is really being said , and whether it is being said persuasively , " she says .
functional skills however , whatever you believe about the current gcse , the fact is that the government has decided that students must , in future , be tested more specifically on functional skills .
as the government said in february 2005 : " we will ensure that no-one can get a grade c or better in gcse english or maths without mastering the functional elements . "
for now , though , advisers and ministers are locked into a debate over whether the functional skills should be incorporated into the gcse itself or tested separately .
examinations are the key driver of the teaching and learning in our schools , whether we like it or not .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations .
league tables demand it .
the problem they face is that society can not agree what those skills should be .
should english language exams be a test of the essential skills for effective functioning in the workplace ?
or should they assess something much broader : an understanding of the nuances , sub-texts and uses of language ?
many would say it should be both .
in which case a simple return to the o-level would not work .
but maybe there is also a case for ensuring that pupils can walk with their language skills before they try to run .

by mike baker bbc news education correspondent would the old o-level prepare them better for life ahead ?
this year it was the turn of the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- to rain on the parade during gcse results week .
at least it was not the old refrain of " pass rates are up , standards must have fallen " .
instead , the cbi cast doubt on whether schools were educating young people in the so-called " functional skills " they will need in the workplace .
by this they mean skills such as : simple mental arithmetic , competence in percentages , legible handwriting , correct grammar and spelling .
publishing its concerns in the same week as 16-year-olds received their gcse results was an effective media strategy , although those celebrating their hard-earned grades may not have welcomed it .
in fact , the cbi had already won this battle .
the government agreed a while back to include functional skills within gcses from 2010 .
this has caused consternation amongst teachers , and even amongst some of the government 's own advisers , who believe gcses already test these essential skills of literacy and numeracy .
pupils ' views so who is right ?
does gcse english really prepare young people for the communication skills they need in work ?
or would we be better off going back to the old o-level ?
let 's look at some of the evidence .
ever-improving gcse results lead many to lament the o-level first , what do young people say after they have started work ?
the car manufacturer , bmw , surveyed the views of its young employees at the hams hall plant in warwickshire .
it found that two-thirds believed school had not prepared them at all well to " use the telephone to request information or answer a query " .
more than half felt they had not been prepared well for chairing a meeting , interviewing someone for a job , or reading and writing a text message .
by contrast , they thought school had prepared them well for : team-working , presenting a report , spotting a writer 's bias , writing a report , word processing , drafting and editing , using correct punctuation and spelling .
overall that seems a fairly good vote of confidence in school from this particular set of former pupils .
would we really expect school to prepare pupils for sending text messages or conducting job interviews ?
the exams so what about exams : how have they changed over the years ?
i looked at a gce o-level english language paper from 1956 .
it asked students to read a 350-word text about poverty and then summarise it in just 100 words .
candidates were also asked to identify parts of grammar such as : verbs , nouns , prepositions , adverbs and adjectival phrases .
further sections gave examples of ambiguous sentences -lrb- for example : " two girls went for a tramp on the downs " -rrb- and asked candidates to rewrite them to show the two possible meanings .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations by contrast , modern gcse english papers test students on an extensive anthology of writing that they have studied over the past two years .
it then asks them to comment on the use of language by the writers .
for example , a 2005 aqa paper asked candidates to " compare the ways " two poets presented a particular culture in two different poems .
the two exam papers could hardly be more different .
the o-level focused on literal understanding , clarity of writing , recognition of parts of speech and the dangers of ambiguity .
the gcse , by contrast , required much broader reading and more extensive writing by the candidate .
there was no requirement to identify parts of speech or to summarise meaning .
however it did require candidates to show an understanding of the writer 's message , including reading between the lines and analysis of how writers used language .
in many ways the modern exam requires more sophisticated skills .
but are we , as some argue , trying to get pupils to run before they can walk ?
is it an essential prerequisite that students know what a preposition is and are able to paraphrase , before we expect them to conduct a practical criticism exercise on a piece of literary writing ?
i suspect the answer depends on whether you regard school as a preparation for work or for something much broader .
against the gcse i asked a couple of experts for their views on the respective merits of the o-level and the gcse .
james williams is a lecturer in education at the university of sussex who , last year , taught o-levels again for a channel 4 tv programme .
despite having been a staunch defender of gcses in the past , this experience changed his mind .
he now believes parts of the o-level should be incorporated into modern exams .
he believes one of the problems of the gcse is that it now asks 16-year-olds to master skills that , in the past , were left until a-level or even university .
as he puts it , the o-level " really did test understanding " .
in english it " taught the structure of language and taught pupils how to communicate in different contexts and circumstances " .
williams ' expertise is in science education where he says the gcse breaks questions down into multiple parts , each requiring only a few words for each answer .
" i do n't feel you can communicate in such a short space , " he says .
his point is that you " only know if you understand something when you have to explain it to others " .
for the gcse for another view , i asked sue horner , head of english , language and the arts at the qualifications and curriculum authority which oversees examinations in england .
she strongly defends the gcse against charges that it does not equip students with functional literacy .
she points out that , unlike the o-level , the gcse tests students ' skills in speaking and listening , adding that employers " are saying it is really important to be able to present to others and to speak on the phone to customers " .
she is also indignant at any suggestion that the gcse does not test basics like punctuation and spelling .
one-third of the marks are allocated to these basics , she says , and it would be virtually impossible to get a grade c if you could not spell or punctuate .
she believes today 's students would find the o-level very dull and narrow .
" whereas it used to ask students to paraphrase , we now ask them to get underneath the meaning , to sort out what is really being said , and whether it is being said persuasively , " she says .
functional skills however , whatever you believe about the current gcse , the fact is that the government has decided that students must , in future , be tested more specifically on functional skills .
as the government said in february 2005 : " we will ensure that no-one can get a grade c or better in gcse english or maths without mastering the functional elements . "
for now , though , advisers and ministers are locked into a debate over whether the functional skills should be incorporated into the gcse itself or tested separately .
examinations are the key driver of the teaching and learning in our schools , whether we like it or not .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations .
league tables demand it .
the problem they face is that society can not agree what those skills should be .
should english language exams be a test of the essential skills for effective functioning in the workplace ?
or should they assess something much broader : an understanding of the nuances , sub-texts and uses of language ?
many would say it should be both .
in which case a simple return to the o-level would not work .
but maybe there is also a case for ensuring that pupils can walk with their language skills before they try to run .

by mike baker bbc news education correspondent would the old o-level prepare them better for life ahead ?
this year it was the turn of the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- to rain on the parade during gcse results week .
at least it was not the old refrain of " pass rates are up , standards must have fallen " .
instead , the cbi cast doubt on whether schools were educating young people in the so-called " functional skills " they will need in the workplace .
by this they mean skills such as : simple mental arithmetic , competence in percentages , legible handwriting , correct grammar and spelling .
publishing its concerns in the same week as 16-year-olds received their gcse results was an effective media strategy , although those celebrating their hard-earned grades may not have welcomed it .
in fact , the cbi had already won this battle .
the government agreed a while back to include functional skills within gcses from 2010 .
this has caused consternation amongst teachers , and even amongst some of the government 's own advisers , who believe gcses already test these essential skills of literacy and numeracy .
pupils ' views so who is right ?
does gcse english really prepare young people for the communication skills they need in work ?
or would we be better off going back to the old o-level ?
let 's look at some of the evidence .
ever-improving gcse results lead many to lament the o-level first , what do young people say after they have started work ?
the car manufacturer , bmw , surveyed the views of its young employees at the hams hall plant in warwickshire .
it found that two-thirds believed school had not prepared them at all well to " use the telephone to request information or answer a query " .
more than half felt they had not been prepared well for chairing a meeting , interviewing someone for a job , or reading and writing a text message .
by contrast , they thought school had prepared them well for : team-working , presenting a report , spotting a writer 's bias , writing a report , word processing , drafting and editing , using correct punctuation and spelling .
overall that seems a fairly good vote of confidence in school from this particular set of former pupils .
would we really expect school to prepare pupils for sending text messages or conducting job interviews ?
the exams so what about exams : how have they changed over the years ?
i looked at a gce o-level english language paper from 1956 .
it asked students to read a 350-word text about poverty and then summarise it in just 100 words .
candidates were also asked to identify parts of grammar such as : verbs , nouns , prepositions , adverbs and adjectival phrases .
further sections gave examples of ambiguous sentences -lrb- for example : " two girls went for a tramp on the downs " -rrb- and asked candidates to rewrite them to show the two possible meanings .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations by contrast , modern gcse english papers test students on an extensive anthology of writing that they have studied over the past two years .
it then asks them to comment on the use of language by the writers .
for example , a 2005 aqa paper asked candidates to " compare the ways " two poets presented a particular culture in two different poems .
the two exam papers could hardly be more different .
the o-level focused on literal understanding , clarity of writing , recognition of parts of speech and the dangers of ambiguity .
the gcse , by contrast , required much broader reading and more extensive writing by the candidate .
there was no requirement to identify parts of speech or to summarise meaning .
however it did require candidates to show an understanding of the writer 's message , including reading between the lines and analysis of how writers used language .
in many ways the modern exam requires more sophisticated skills .
but are we , as some argue , trying to get pupils to run before they can walk ?
is it an essential prerequisite that students know what a preposition is and are able to paraphrase , before we expect them to conduct a practical criticism exercise on a piece of literary writing ?
i suspect the answer depends on whether you regard school as a preparation for work or for something much broader .
against the gcse i asked a couple of experts for their views on the respective merits of the o-level and the gcse .
james williams is a lecturer in education at the university of sussex who , last year , taught o-levels again for a channel 4 tv programme .
despite having been a staunch defender of gcses in the past , this experience changed his mind .
he now believes parts of the o-level should be incorporated into modern exams .
he believes one of the problems of the gcse is that it now asks 16-year-olds to master skills that , in the past , were left until a-level or even university .
as he puts it , the o-level " really did test understanding " .
in english it " taught the structure of language and taught pupils how to communicate in different contexts and circumstances " .
williams ' expertise is in science education where he says the gcse breaks questions down into multiple parts , each requiring only a few words for each answer .
" i do n't feel you can communicate in such a short space , " he says .
his point is that you " only know if you understand something when you have to explain it to others " .
for the gcse for another view , i asked sue horner , head of english , language and the arts at the qualifications and curriculum authority which oversees examinations in england .
she strongly defends the gcse against charges that it does not equip students with functional literacy .
she points out that , unlike the o-level , the gcse tests students ' skills in speaking and listening , adding that employers " are saying it is really important to be able to present to others and to speak on the phone to customers " .
she is also indignant at any suggestion that the gcse does not test basics like punctuation and spelling .
one-third of the marks are allocated to these basics , she says , and it would be virtually impossible to get a grade c if you could not spell or punctuate .
she believes today 's students would find the o-level very dull and narrow .
" whereas it used to ask students to paraphrase , we now ask them to get underneath the meaning , to sort out what is really being said , and whether it is being said persuasively , " she says .
functional skills however , whatever you believe about the current gcse , the fact is that the government has decided that students must , in future , be tested more specifically on functional skills .
as the government said in february 2005 : " we will ensure that no-one can get a grade c or better in gcse english or maths without mastering the functional elements . "
for now , though , advisers and ministers are locked into a debate over whether the functional skills should be incorporated into the gcse itself or tested separately .
examinations are the key driver of the teaching and learning in our schools , whether we like it or not .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations .
league tables demand it .
the problem they face is that society can not agree what those skills should be .
should english language exams be a test of the essential skills for effective functioning in the workplace ?
or should they assess something much broader : an understanding of the nuances , sub-texts and uses of language ?
many would say it should be both .
in which case a simple return to the o-level would not work .
but maybe there is also a case for ensuring that pupils can walk with their language skills before they try to run .

by mike baker bbc news education correspondent would the old o-level prepare them better for life ahead ?
this year it was the turn of the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- to rain on the parade during gcse results week .
at least it was not the old refrain of " pass rates are up , standards must have fallen " .
instead , the cbi cast doubt on whether schools were educating young people in the so-called " functional skills " they will need in the workplace .
by this they mean skills such as : simple mental arithmetic , competence in percentages , legible handwriting , correct grammar and spelling .
publishing its concerns in the same week as 16-year-olds received their gcse results was an effective media strategy , although those celebrating their hard-earned grades may not have welcomed it .
in fact , the cbi had already won this battle .
the government agreed a while back to include functional skills within gcses from 2010 .
this has caused consternation amongst teachers , and even amongst some of the government 's own advisers , who believe gcses already test these essential skills of literacy and numeracy .
pupils ' views so who is right ?
does gcse english really prepare young people for the communication skills they need in work ?
or would we be better off going back to the old o-level ?
let 's look at some of the evidence .
ever-improving gcse results lead many to lament the o-level first , what do young people say after they have started work ?
the car manufacturer , bmw , surveyed the views of its young employees at the hams hall plant in warwickshire .
it found that two-thirds believed school had not prepared them at all well to " use the telephone to request information or answer a query " .
more than half felt they had not been prepared well for chairing a meeting , interviewing someone for a job , or reading and writing a text message .
by contrast , they thought school had prepared them well for : team-working , presenting a report , spotting a writer 's bias , writing a report , word processing , drafting and editing , using correct punctuation and spelling .
overall that seems a fairly good vote of confidence in school from this particular set of former pupils .
would we really expect school to prepare pupils for sending text messages or conducting job interviews ?
the exams so what about exams : how have they changed over the years ?
i looked at a gce o-level english language paper from 1956 .
it asked students to read a 350-word text about poverty and then summarise it in just 100 words .
candidates were also asked to identify parts of grammar such as : verbs , nouns , prepositions , adverbs and adjectival phrases .
further sections gave examples of ambiguous sentences -lrb- for example : " two girls went for a tramp on the downs " -rrb- and asked candidates to rewrite them to show the two possible meanings .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations by contrast , modern gcse english papers test students on an extensive anthology of writing that they have studied over the past two years .
it then asks them to comment on the use of language by the writers .
for example , a 2005 aqa paper asked candidates to " compare the ways " two poets presented a particular culture in two different poems .
the two exam papers could hardly be more different .
the o-level focused on literal understanding , clarity of writing , recognition of parts of speech and the dangers of ambiguity .
the gcse , by contrast , required much broader reading and more extensive writing by the candidate .
there was no requirement to identify parts of speech or to summarise meaning .
however it did require candidates to show an understanding of the writer 's message , including reading between the lines and analysis of how writers used language .
in many ways the modern exam requires more sophisticated skills .
but are we , as some argue , trying to get pupils to run before they can walk ?
is it an essential prerequisite that students know what a preposition is and are able to paraphrase , before we expect them to conduct a practical criticism exercise on a piece of literary writing ?
i suspect the answer depends on whether you regard school as a preparation for work or for something much broader .
against the gcse i asked a couple of experts for their views on the respective merits of the o-level and the gcse .
james williams is a lecturer in education at the university of sussex who , last year , taught o-levels again for a channel 4 tv programme .
despite having been a staunch defender of gcses in the past , this experience changed his mind .
he now believes parts of the o-level should be incorporated into modern exams .
he believes one of the problems of the gcse is that it now asks 16-year-olds to master skills that , in the past , were left until a-level or even university .
as he puts it , the o-level " really did test understanding " .
in english it " taught the structure of language and taught pupils how to communicate in different contexts and circumstances " .
williams ' expertise is in science education where he says the gcse breaks questions down into multiple parts , each requiring only a few words for each answer .
" i do n't feel you can communicate in such a short space , " he says .
his point is that you " only know if you understand something when you have to explain it to others " .
for the gcse for another view , i asked sue horner , head of english , language and the arts at the qualifications and curriculum authority which oversees examinations in england .
she strongly defends the gcse against charges that it does not equip students with functional literacy .
she points out that , unlike the o-level , the gcse tests students ' skills in speaking and listening , adding that employers " are saying it is really important to be able to present to others and to speak on the phone to customers " .
she is also indignant at any suggestion that the gcse does not test basics like punctuation and spelling .
one-third of the marks are allocated to these basics , she says , and it would be virtually impossible to get a grade c if you could not spell or punctuate .
she believes today 's students would find the o-level very dull and narrow .
" whereas it used to ask students to paraphrase , we now ask them to get underneath the meaning , to sort out what is really being said , and whether it is being said persuasively , " she says .
functional skills however , whatever you believe about the current gcse , the fact is that the government has decided that students must , in future , be tested more specifically on functional skills .
as the government said in february 2005 : " we will ensure that no-one can get a grade c or better in gcse english or maths without mastering the functional elements . "
for now , though , advisers and ministers are locked into a debate over whether the functional skills should be incorporated into the gcse itself or tested separately .
examinations are the key driver of the teaching and learning in our schools , whether we like it or not .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations .
league tables demand it .
the problem they face is that society can not agree what those skills should be .
should english language exams be a test of the essential skills for effective functioning in the workplace ?
or should they assess something much broader : an understanding of the nuances , sub-texts and uses of language ?
many would say it should be both .
in which case a simple return to the o-level would not work .
but maybe there is also a case for ensuring that pupils can walk with their language skills before they try to run .

it found that two-thirds believed school had not prepared them at all well to " use the telephone to request information or answer a query " .
more than half felt they had not been prepared well for chairing a meeting , interviewing someone for a job , or reading and writing a text message .
by contrast , they thought school had prepared them well for : team-working , presenting a report , spotting a writer 's bias , writing a report , word processing , drafting and editing , using correct punctuation and spelling .
overall that seems a fairly good vote of confidence in school from this particular set of former pupils .
would we really expect school to prepare pupils for sending text messages or conducting job interviews ?
the exams so what about exams : how have they changed over the years ?
i looked at a gce o-level english language paper from 1956 .
it asked students to read a 350-word text about poverty and then summarise it in just 100 words .
candidates were also asked to identify parts of grammar such as : verbs , nouns , prepositions , adverbs and adjectival phrases .
further sections gave examples of ambiguous sentences -lrb- for example : " two girls went for a tramp on the downs " -rrb- and asked candidates to rewrite them to show the two possible meanings . "
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations " by contrast , modern gcse english papers test students on an extensive anthology of writing that they have studied over the past two years .
it then asks them to comment on the use of language by the writers .
for example , a 2005 aqa paper asked candidates to " compare the ways " two poets presented a particular culture in two different poems .
the two exam papers could hardly be more different .
the o-level focused on literal understanding , clarity of writing , recognition of parts of speech and the dangers of ambiguity .
the gcse , by contrast , required much broader reading and more extensive writing by the candidate .
there was no requirement to identify parts of speech or to summarise meaning .
however it did require candidates to show an understanding of the writer 's message , including reading between the lines and analysis of how writers used language .
in many ways the modern exam requires more sophisticated skills .
but are we , as some argue , trying to get pupils to run before they can walk ?
is it an essential prerequisite that students know what a preposition is and are able to paraphrase , before we expect them to conduct a practical criticism exercise on a piece of literary writing ?
i suspect the answer depends on whether you regard school as a preparation for work or for something much broader .
against the gcse i asked a couple of experts for their views on the respective merits of the o-level and the gcse .
james williams is a lecturer in education at the university of sussex who , last year , taught o-levels again for a channel 4 tv programme .
despite having been a staunch defender of gcses in the past , this experience changed his mind .
he now believes parts of the o-level should be incorporated into modern exams .
he believes one of the problems of the gcse is that it now asks 16-year-olds to master skills that , in the past , were left until a-level or even university .
as he puts it , the o-level " really did test understanding " .
in english it " taught the structure of language and taught pupils how to communicate in different contexts and circumstances " .
williams ' expertise is in science education where he says the gcse breaks questions down into multiple parts , each requiring only a few words for each answer .
" i do n't feel you can communicate in such a short space , " he says .
his point is that you " only know if you understand something when you have to explain it to others " .
for the gcse for another view , i asked sue horner , head of english , language and the arts at the qualifications and curriculum authority which oversees examinations in england .
she strongly defends the gcse against charges that it does not equip students with functional literacy .
she points out that , unlike the o-level , the gcse tests students ' skills in speaking and listening , adding that employers " are saying it is really important to be able to present to others and to speak on the phone to customers " .
she is also indignant at any suggestion that the gcse does not test basics like punctuation and spelling .
one-third of the marks are allocated to these basics , she says , and it would be virtually impossible to get a grade c if you could not spell or punctuate .
she believes today 's students would find the o-level very dull and narrow .
" whereas it used to ask students to paraphrase , we now ask them to get underneath the meaning , to sort out what is really being said , and whether it is being said persuasively , " she says .
functional skills however , whatever you believe about the current gcse , the fact is that the government has decided that students must , in future , be tested more specifically on functional skills .
as the government said in february 2005 : " we will ensure that no-one can get a grade c or better in gcse english or maths without mastering the functional elements . "
for now , though , advisers and ministers are locked into a debate over whether the functional skills should be incorporated into the gcse itself or tested separately .
examinations are the key driver of the teaching and learning in our schools , whether we like it or not .
students and teachers can not be blamed for focusing on the skills required by public examinations .
league tables demand it .
the problem they face is that society can not agree what those skills should be .
should english language exams be a test of the essential skills for effective functioning in the workplace ?
or should they assess something much broader : an understanding of the nuances , sub-texts and uses of language ?
many would say it should be both .
in which case a simple return to the o-level would not work .
but maybe there is also a case for ensuring that pupils can walk with their language skills before they try to run .

sony has teamed up with us biologists who already run the distributed computing project , folding @ home -lrb- fah -rrb- .
the project harnesses the capacity of thousands of pcs to examine how the shape of proteins , critical to most biological functions , affect disease .
fah say a network of ps3s will allow performance similar to supercomputers .
with 10,000 machines joined together the researchers calculate they should be able to do a thousand trillion calculations per second .
if that was achieved it would be nearly four times as fast as the world 's most powerful supercomputer , ibm 's bluegene / l system , capable of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
complex problems distributed computing is a way of solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
cell specs 256 billion calculations per second 2.5mb of on-chip memory able to shuttle data to and from off-chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors the cell 's hard sell volunteers download a piece of software that uses their pc or ps3 's processing power when it is idle .
in this way small packets of data can be crunched by individual machines , before being automatically fed back over the internet to a central computer where all of the results can be viewed together .
the method is already used by scientists examining millions of simulations of how malaria spreads to look for ways to control the disease .
other groups are searching through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
biological processes the fah uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
the way in which proteins contort underpins almost every biological process .
when they do not fold correctly they can cause diseases such as huntington 's , parkinson 's disease , and many cancers .
scientists still do not entirely understand how or why this process occurs .
to try to gain a better understanding , scientists need to simulate the complex folding process .
however , although a fold may take just ten millionths of a second -lrb- 10 microseconds -rrb- in the body , it takes far longer to simulate on a computer .
an average pc would take all day just to simulate just one billionth of a second -lrb- one nanosecond -rrb- of protein folding , and 10,000 days to simulate a complete fold .
dividing the problem up allows the researchers to speed through many more simulations .
advanced gaming the scientists hope the arrival of the ps3 will take this research up another level .
sony has demonstrated a piece of protein-folding software that will run on its ps3 when it is launched in november .
the ps3 has a powerful processor known as a " cell " , which will run up to 10 times faster than current pc chips .
a graphical interface , also being developed between sony and fah , will eventually allow users and the scientists to look at the protein from different angles as it folds in real-time .
the new interface takes advantage of the ps3 's graphics chip , designed for advanced gaming .
the graphics application is currently undergoing tests and is expected to be finished by september .
when the program is released to ps3 owners , the scientists say they will be able to " address questions previously considered impossible to tackle computationally " .

sony has teamed up with us biologists who already run the distributed computing project , folding @ home -lrb- fah -rrb- .
the project harnesses the capacity of thousands of pcs to examine how the shape of proteins , critical to most biological functions , affect disease .
fah say a network of ps3s will allow performance similar to supercomputers .
with 10,000 machines joined together the researchers calculate they should be able to do a thousand trillion calculations per second .
if that was achieved it would be nearly four times as fast as the world 's most powerful supercomputer , ibm 's bluegene / l system , capable of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
complex problems distributed computing is a way of solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
cell specs 256 billion calculations per second 2.5mb of on-chip memory able to shuttle data to and from off-chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors the cell 's hard sell volunteers download a piece of software that uses their pc or ps3 's processing power when it is idle .
in this way small packets of data can be crunched by individual machines , before being automatically fed back over the internet to a central computer where all of the results can be viewed together .
the method is already used by scientists examining millions of simulations of how malaria spreads to look for ways to control the disease .
other groups are searching through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
biological processes the fah uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
the way in which proteins contort underpins almost every biological process .
when they do not fold correctly they can cause diseases such as huntington 's , parkinson 's disease , and many cancers .
scientists still do not entirely understand how or why this process occurs .
to try to gain a better understanding , scientists need to simulate the complex folding process .
however , although a fold may take just ten millionths of a second -lrb- 10 microseconds -rrb- in the body , it takes far longer to simulate on a computer .
an average pc would take all day just to simulate just one billionth of a second -lrb- one nanosecond -rrb- of protein folding , and 10,000 days to simulate a complete fold .
dividing the problem up allows the researchers to speed through many more simulations .
advanced gaming the scientists hope the arrival of the ps3 will take this research up another level .
sony has demonstrated a piece of protein-folding software that will run on its ps3 when it is launched in november .
the ps3 has a powerful processor known as a " cell " , which will run up to 10 times faster than current pc chips .
a graphical interface , also being developed between sony and fah , will eventually allow users and the scientists to look at the protein from different angles as it folds in real-time .
the new interface takes advantage of the ps3 's graphics chip , designed for advanced gaming .
the graphics application is currently undergoing tests and is expected to be finished by september .
when the program is released to ps3 owners , the scientists say they will be able to " address questions previously considered impossible to tackle computationally " .

if that was achieved it would be nearly four times as fast as the world 's most powerful supercomputer , ibm 's bluegene / l system , capable of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
complex problems distributed computing is a way of solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
cell specs 256 billion calculations per second 2.5mb of on-chip memory able to shuttle data to and from off-chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors the cell 's hard sell volunteers download a piece of software that uses their pc or ps3 's processing power when it is idle .
in this way small packets of data can be crunched by individual machines , before being automatically fed back over the internet to a central computer where all of the results can be viewed together .
the method is already used by scientists examining millions of simulations of how malaria spreads to look for ways to control the disease .
other groups are searching through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
biological processes the fah uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
the way in which proteins contort underpins almost every biological process .
when they do not fold correctly they can cause diseases such as huntington 's , parkinson 's disease , and many cancers .
scientists still do not entirely understand how or why this process occurs .
to try to gain a better understanding , scientists need to simulate the complex folding process .
however , although a fold may take just ten millionths of a second -lrb- 10 microseconds -rrb- in the body , it takes far longer to simulate on a computer .
an average pc would take all day just to simulate just one billionth of a second -lrb- one nanosecond -rrb- of protein folding , and 10,000 days to simulate a complete fold .
dividing the problem up allows the researchers to speed through many more simulations .
advanced gaming the scientists hope the arrival of the ps3 will take this research up another level .
sony has demonstrated a piece of protein-folding software that will run on its ps3 when it is launched in november .
the ps3 has a powerful processor known as a " cell " , which will run up to 10 times faster than current pc chips .
a graphical interface , also being developed between sony and fah , will eventually allow users and the scientists to look at the protein from different angles as it folds in real-time .
the new interface takes advantage of the ps3 's graphics chip , designed for advanced gaming .
the graphics application is currently undergoing tests and is expected to be finished by september .
when the program is released to ps3 owners , the scientists say they will be able to " address questions previously considered impossible to tackle computationally " .

the maoists are refusing to disarm completely .
indeed , there are fresh reports of them abducting and even killing people in some places .
but in other locations they are on a drive to win ordinary people 's hearts and minds .
they have also started building camps in their own favoured locations .
one is a hilltop in the village of muntang in the rugged hills of palpa in western nepal .
anti-monarchy slogans here men and women of the krishna sen memorial brigade dig in , building sentry posts and bunkers , living in large blue-and-white tents and eating communally . "
in the past we were preparing for war ... but now we 're closer to the people every day " comrade seetal maoist commissar previously the rebels were more fragmented , living nomadically , going from house to house and demanding food and accommodation .
" the current ceasefire requires a place for us to be together , " says comrade seetal , the brigade 's commissar or senior political figure .
he denies the site is aimed at intimidating the nepalese army , based at the district headquarters of tansen which is visible 30km -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- away across a spectacular , gleaming river valley .
in the village , maoist leaders join in a traditional hindu festival , banging cymbals and dancing - and persuading the revellers to shout anti-monarchy slogans .
after the dancing , the guerrillas promise they now want peace .
" without you , we ca n't do anything , " one tells the crowd .
" you 've given us so much love , such a welcome .
if we go back to revolution , we 'll all go together . "
as if to try and prove their good intent , the maoists are doing community work .
at a school , uniformed troops hack the soil to make a playground , watched by an eagle-eyed armed guard .
their guns are deposited in a pile at the side .
' time for development ' nearby , maoist doctors have opened a library and a health post , taking villagers ' blood pressure and dispensing pills .
we are told the houses used for these facilities are the homes of people who have migrated to the plains .
in pictures : maoists mingle the rebels were long known for destroying structures such as bridges and roads .
but commissar seetal insists those days are over .
" in the past we were preparing for war - we had no time for development , " he said .
" we were too much at risk from the army .
but now we 're closer to the people every day .
our relations are much improved . "
despite this social activity , though , the guerrillas remain combat-ready and preoccupied with security .
in the early morning mist , inside the camp , 50 maoists snap their feet to shouted orders .
proudly , they display their guns above their heads in a physical training drill .
the place bristles with ak-47s and other captured weapons .
the rebels ' team-talk has a harder edge than the briefing given to the villagers .
the battalion commissar says rebel soldiers must be ready to destroy the camp and go back to war if absolutely necessary .
but they must strive to work for peace , switching their orientation from a war of weapons to what he calls " a war of ideas " .
gathered in the camp , some have their young children with them - some playing with the guns , even putting their fingers on the triggers .
the rebels have not yet agreed to be separated from their arms within the camps , despite the government 's insistence that they should do so .
the attitude of platoon commander lokendra is typical .
" our arms are like a life-partner for us , " he says .
" it would be quite new to be separated from them .
" if it 's a conspiracy that makes us give them up , we 'll revolt .
but if it 's for peace and directed by the party , i 'd do anything . "
in tansen , which seems a world away , people are familiar with maoist firepower .
maoists coming from areas like muntang attacked the town in january .
' no trust ' heavy fighting around government buildings and a radio station left more than 20 people dead .
the beautiful old palace which used to house the district government is almost completely destroyed - a shell surrounded by rubble .
teacher jhapendra khadka came here , fleeing his village , last year after maoists beat him up for not appointing a rebel sympathiser to a job .

lord justice wall said he wants a new system that puts the needs of children and financial provision at the heart of the divorce process .
the court of appeal judge told the independent that " quick and easy " divorces are undermining the institution of marriage .
his comments follow a series of high-profile divorce battles .
they include the case of beverley charman , who was awarded £ 48m out of her husband john 's fortune , and that of melissa miller , whose husband alan was ordered to pay her £ 5m .
lord justice wall , who is one of britain 's foremost family law judges , heard the latter case in the court of appeal .
blame game under the terms of england and wales 's divorce laws , couples have to blame each other if they want a quick divorce , usually granted within six months .
lord justice wall told the independent : " i do believe strongly in the institution of marriage as the best way to bring up children and that 's one of the reasons why i would like to end the quick and easy divorces based on the fault system .
" i think that it actually undermines marriage . "
but he said the introduction of a new legal system for divorce would be difficult as people " do n't like not being able to blame someone in a divorce " .
family law reformers welcomed lord justice wall 's comments .
" we are behind the principle of no-fault divorce because we would like to see an end to couples having to make allegations about each other 's behaviour , " said jane mcculloch , the vice-chairman of family law reform group resolution .
more divorces there were just more than 310,000 weddings in the uk in 2004 - the latest year for which official figures were available - down from a peak of 480,000 in 1972 .
but there were 167,000 divorces in 2004 , the fourth year in a row that the number had increased .
the government scrapped plans to introduce no-fault divorces in 2001 .
it said the system designed to replace them was unworkable .
lord justice wall said he did not accept that explanation , although he acknowledged that the law commission 's original proposals had been " mauled " by a series of amendments in parliament .

the court of appeal judge told the independent that " quick and easy " divorces are undermining the institution of marriage .
his comments follow a series of high-profile divorce battles .
they include the case of beverley charman , who was awarded £ 48m out of her husband john 's fortune , and that of melissa miller , whose husband alan was ordered to pay her £ 5m .
lord justice wall , who is one of britain 's foremost family law judges , heard the latter case in the court of appeal .

it said the system designed to replace them was unworkable .

the prostate cancer charity said it had assurances that men in wales could have brachytherapy , a type of radiotherapy .
but health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- has confirmed it will not pay for the treatment due to its costs .
velindre hospital , near cardiff , said it may lose a £ 130,000 charity donation to set up a brachytherapy centre .
hcw is in discussion with the hospital .
the charity claimed in june that men in wales were being denied brachytherapy , when the treatment was available in scotland and england .
it is essential that high-quality prostate cancer services are offered consistently across the uk john neate it claimed the situation was another example of a healthcare postcode lottery as brachytherapy had been available for two years until hcw withdrew funding for it .
the charity said it was given assurances from hcw that a form of the treatment would be available .
brachytherapy is becoming recognised as an alternative to both radical surgery and standard radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment .
it involves radioactive seeds being implanted directly into the prostate gland .
' regret ' the prostate cancer charity said its advantage was its " sheer convenience , " with far shorter stays in hospital .
in june , hcw 's national commissioning advisory board approved a paper on the treatment , subject to a recommendation that hcw worked with velindre nhs trust , a cancer care centre , to look at possibly establishing a local service in the future .
hcw has since decided " with regret " that the costs of a specialist centre would be beyond its budget .
hcw said : " it has become clear that the specialist centres are unable to offer services within the budget hcw has identified .
" low dose brachytherapy has not been identified as a priority for investment in 2006 , and as a result can not be fully accommodated within hcw 's commissioning plan for this year . "
care hcw said prostate cancer patients would still be able to have surgery or standard radiotherapy locally and it has offered to meet the prostate cancer charity 's chief executive , john neate .
it added that six patients who were to have brachytherapy have since been authorised for treatment .
but mr neate said the decision not to fund a full service was " totally unreasonable " .
he said : " time after time we are told that the nhs should be about patient-centred care and choice .
" i see no evidence of that in this decision or in the approach of health commission wales .
it is essential that high-quality prostate cancer services are offered consistently across the uk . "
' cheaper ' meanwhile , andrea hague , director of cancer services at velindre nhs trust , said the hospital was still in negotiations with the freemasons ' charity which had offered £ 130,000 towards the capital costs of establishing a brachytherapy centre .
she said : " we put a business case in to health commission wales within the last 12 months to provide a -lsb- brachytherapy -rsb- service in cardiff .
" they said they could not support the business case .
they felt they could get the service cheaper in england . "
she added : " we 're very conscious that the -lsb- charitable -rsb- money is a set-aside .
we 're talking to them about the money . "
a hcw spokesman said : " hcw are continuing to discuss the possibility of developing a low dose brachytherapy service with velindre nhs trust . "

the prostate cancer charity said it had assurances that men in wales could have brachytherapy , a type of radiotherapy .
but health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- has confirmed it will not pay for the treatment due to its costs .
velindre hospital , near cardiff , said it may lose a £ 130,000 charity donation to set up a brachytherapy centre .
hcw is in discussion with the hospital .
the charity claimed in june that men in wales were being denied brachytherapy , when the treatment was available in scotland and england .
it is essential that high-quality prostate cancer services are offered consistently across the uk john neate it claimed the situation was another example of a healthcare postcode lottery as brachytherapy had been available for two years until hcw withdrew funding for it .
the charity said it was given assurances from hcw that a form of the treatment would be available .
brachytherapy is becoming recognised as an alternative to both radical surgery and standard radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment .
it involves radioactive seeds being implanted directly into the prostate gland .
' regret ' the prostate cancer charity said its advantage was its " sheer convenience , " with far shorter stays in hospital .
in june , hcw 's national commissioning advisory board approved a paper on the treatment , subject to a recommendation that hcw worked with velindre nhs trust , a cancer care centre , to look at possibly establishing a local service in the future .
hcw has since decided " with regret " that the costs of a specialist centre would be beyond its budget .
hcw said : " it has become clear that the specialist centres are unable to offer services within the budget hcw has identified .
" low dose brachytherapy has not been identified as a priority for investment in 2006 , and as a result can not be fully accommodated within hcw 's commissioning plan for this year . "
care hcw said prostate cancer patients would still be able to have surgery or standard radiotherapy locally and it has offered to meet the prostate cancer charity 's chief executive , john neate .
it added that six patients who were to have brachytherapy have since been authorised for treatment .
but mr neate said the decision not to fund a full service was " totally unreasonable " .
he said : " time after time we are told that the nhs should be about patient-centred care and choice .
" i see no evidence of that in this decision or in the approach of health commission wales .
it is essential that high-quality prostate cancer services are offered consistently across the uk . "
' cheaper ' meanwhile , andrea hague , director of cancer services at velindre nhs trust , said the hospital was still in negotiations with the freemasons ' charity which had offered £ 130,000 towards the capital costs of establishing a brachytherapy centre .
she said : " we put a business case in to health commission wales within the last 12 months to provide a -lsb- brachytherapy -rsb- service in cardiff .
" they said they could not support the business case .
they felt they could get the service cheaper in england . "
she added : " we 're very conscious that the -lsb- charitable -rsb- money is a set-aside .
