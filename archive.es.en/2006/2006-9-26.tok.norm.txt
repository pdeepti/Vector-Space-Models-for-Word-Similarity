the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "
despite the strong support for the new laws , a demonstration was held in zurich on monday night to denounce them .
protesters said switzerland should be ashamed of itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "
despite the strong support for the new laws , a demonstration was held in zurich on monday night to denounce them .
protesters said switzerland should be ashamed of itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .

" there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler .

" i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling .

" the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler .

" i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2006 daimler-chrysler 's " dr. z " becomes icon despite massive losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter " dr. z " zetsche 's popular television commercials have not helped daimler-chrysler despite becoming a cult tv star in the us , daimlerchrysler 's chairman dieter zetsche could n't stop the automotive giant from posting massive third quarter losses in september . it 's been a mixed few days for daimlerchrysler and it chairman , dieter zetsche .
the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.09.2006 labor policies need changes as germans live longer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average life span has gone up 2.5 years per decade a shift in demographics means germany should alter its labor policies to encourage more older people to continue working as the average life span grows and the birth rate stagnates , according to some experts . germany has a tradition of aged politicians - konrad adenauer was 73 when became the first chancellor of the federal republic in 1949 and remained a member of parliament until his death at the ripe age of 91 while helmut schmidt is 87 , and his successor helmut kohl , at 75 , is still going strong - but it 's not just the politicians who have a proclivity for living long lives . the average german 's life span is also rising , according to data released by the health ministry last week .
for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .

these days , though , the international star is causing discontent in german music circles for his novel approach to music . " welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .
" people are just upset because it is a lot of change at one time . " a new direction it was not seen as just a new direction for music at the orchestra when rattle was appointed conductor in 2002 , but also a new way of doing business in the arts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle is known for his frizzy locks and electric style bankrupt berlin , with its three major orchestras , transformed the public philharmonic into a quasi-private foundation with increased autonomy in artistic and business matters .
that was a first in germany , where the performing arts are mainly financed - and controlled - by the state . it was also anticipated that the 51-year-old liverpool native , who is credited with revamping birmingham 's orchestra , would shake things up at the berlin philharmonic with his youthful style and willingness to eschew 19th century german romantic standards for more modern and experimental music as well as reach out to the young through school programs . rattle , who is nicknamed feuerkopf or fire-head , has shattered the stereotype of the aloof german conductor .
instead , with a mop of curly hair , an energetic style and an ever-present grin , he has won over audiences with his communicative personality and his trademark mantra that " music is for everyone . " " the thrill is gone " still , in early summer , what was simmering among music circles hit the public after a well-known german music critic called for rattle 's ouster and said he was the cause of the decline at the berlin philharmonic . " we 've grown used to him - the thrill is gone , has yielded to more pedestrian charms , " wrote manuel brug , chief music critic of die welt newspaper .
" we are well-acquainted with his dashing gestures , we 've seen through his permanent expression of ecstasy , which has curdled into a mask in the meantime . " brug also accused rattle of betraying the german sound . " in working with this venerable orchestra , he neglects the great german symphonic tradition ... nor does he set out for distant lands , " he wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle beat out conductor daniel barenboim for the job in the german classical music scene , the philharmonic 's trademark , the " german " sound is one that is rich , dark and romantic in its renditions of the standards from bach , beethoven , bruckner , wagner and strauss . rattle , on the other hand , is bringing in works from the past 80 years such as berg and schönberg .
that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials . " the berlin philharmonic is in superlative shape , " wrote pianist alfred brendel in the british newspaper , the guardian .
" while it has fully retained its richness in romantic symphonies , it has opened itself up to contemporary as well as to 18th-century music in a novel way . " the old and the new the fight over rattle is really a fight between tradition and the new , many say .
it is has impacted a number of artists in germany trying to turn things around , most notably american choreographer william forsythe , who headed the frankfurt ballet from 1984 to 2004 .
the city declined to renew forsythe 's contract after officials decided they wanted a return to more classical ballet productions instead of his modern interpretations . some say that flexibility and variety in the arts is exactly what is needed to bring in younger and more cosmopolitan audiences , but they warn that such efforts might come at the expense of an institution 's prestige . " the berlin philharmonic under simon rattle has not lost its sound , " wrote musicologist christiane tewinkel in berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper . " someone like sir simon rattle , who says that if he believes in anything , it 's that ' this music is for everyone ' , is right on one hand , " she wrote .
" on the other , however , he is mistaken about the extent to which classical music continues to thrive on distinction and on the concept of elitism .
all this threatens its brand essence : is the philharmonic really an everyman 's orchestra ?

these days , though , the international star is causing discontent in german music circles for his novel approach to music . " welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .
" people are just upset because it is a lot of change at one time . " a new direction it was not seen as just a new direction for music at the orchestra when rattle was appointed conductor in 2002 , but also a new way of doing business in the arts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle is known for his frizzy locks and electric style bankrupt berlin , with its three major orchestras , transformed the public philharmonic into a quasi-private foundation with increased autonomy in artistic and business matters .

instead , with a mop of curly hair , an energetic style and an ever-present grin , he has won over audiences with his communicative personality and his trademark mantra that " music is for everyone . " " the thrill is gone " still , in early summer , what was simmering among music circles hit the public after a well-known german music critic called for rattle 's ouster and said he was the cause of the decline at the berlin philharmonic . " we 've grown used to him - the thrill is gone , has yielded to more pedestrian charms , " wrote manuel brug , chief music critic of die welt newspaper .
" we are well-acquainted with his dashing gestures , we 've seen through his permanent expression of ecstasy , which has curdled into a mask in the meantime . " brug also accused rattle of betraying the german sound . " in working with this venerable orchestra , he neglects the great german symphonic tradition ... nor does he set out for distant lands , " he wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle beat out conductor daniel barenboim for the job in the german classical music scene , the philharmonic 's trademark , the " german " sound is one that is rich , dark and romantic in its renditions of the standards from bach , beethoven , bruckner , wagner and strauss . rattle , on the other hand , is bringing in works from the past 80 years such as berg and schönberg .
that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials . " the berlin philharmonic is in superlative shape , " wrote pianist alfred brendel in the british newspaper , the guardian .
" while it has fully retained its richness in romantic symphonies , it has opened itself up to contemporary as well as to 18th-century music in a novel way . " the old and the new the fight over rattle is really a fight between tradition and the new , many say .
it is has impacted a number of artists in germany trying to turn things around , most notably american choreographer william forsythe , who headed the frankfurt ballet from 1984 to 2004 .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said . " basically it 's a sedative for people , who do n't think about it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

three european helicopters and 60 french , portuguese and swedish special forces were immediately deployed from their base in gabon when the fighting broke out , followed by a german-dutch battalion of about 450-500 men a day later . eufor has stopped new civil war , says jung kabila and bemba signed an agreement saturday pledging to make kinshasa a " city without weapons . "
however , un and eu peacekeepers - including german paratroopers , polish military police , and spanish and french troops - continue to patrol the streets of congo 's capital as the truce holds . " we have contributed to preventing a new civil war , " jung said monday . jung expressed confidence that the situation in the drc would remain " relatively calm " after the second round of the presidential election , and said the german soldiers should be able to return home before christmas . the defense minister flew on to gabon late monday and was then due to travel on to kinshasa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.09.2006 eu condemns spain for hindering e.on 's endesa bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has a lot of work ahead if it wants to prevent protectionism within the bloc the european commission ruled tuesday that spain had breached eu regulations in trying to protect spanish electricity giant endesa from a takeover bid by german energy group e.on. the commission , the eu 's top competition regulator , said the government in madrid had breached competition rules and internal market regulations after its national authorities placed conditions on the german bid . e.on launched an offer in february to buy endesa for 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- and the commission gave the german group the green light in april to press ahead with its takeover plans . but madrid preferred a merger between endesa and the country 's biggest gas supplier , gas natural , and spain 's own competition regulator placed about 19 conditions , most of them contested by the commission , on e.on 's offer .
prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "
despite the strong support for the new laws , a demonstration was held in zurich on monday night to denounce them .
protesters said switzerland should be ashamed of itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe .

" i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2006 daimler-chrysler 's " dr. z " becomes icon despite massive losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter " dr. z " zetsche 's popular television commercials have not helped daimler-chrysler despite becoming a cult tv star in the us , daimlerchrysler 's chairman dieter zetsche could n't stop the automotive giant from posting massive third quarter losses in september . it 's been a mixed few days for daimlerchrysler and it chairman , dieter zetsche .
the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .
all that leaves dr. z 's fans with a good chance of seeing him back on television screens sometime soon . susan stone / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .

critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .

that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case .

though eu member states are aiming for consensus on the treaty by the end of 2008 , ratification of a new text could take much longer , the euobserver reported . reservations about further enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new member states will have to submit ' progress reports ' every six months romania and bulgaria are set to join the 25-member bloc at a time of weakening support in some eu states for further enlargement and fears of a flood of new job-seeking migrants . most member states are expected to impose restrictions on workers from the two newcomers , as they did when 10 mainly eastern european countries joined in 2004 . britain , which allowed unrestricted access last time , has warned that it is likely to put a cap on immigrants from bulgaria and romania , after half a million eastern europeans have entered the country since 2004 .
romania 's prime minister calin tariceanu , in an interview published monday , said entry into the european union will not spark a wave of mass emigration and appealed to current eu member states to keep their borders open . " free movement of workers should be respected by all member states , " he said . romania , with a population of 22 million , will become the seventh most populous state in the bloc .
together with bulgaria , a country of 8 million , it will be the poorest member state .
per capita output amounts to barely one-third of the eu average .
continued corruption raises concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agricultural subsidies will be at stake if eu conditions are n't met as part of their accession agreement , bulgaria and romania will be obliged to turn in a ' progress report ' about improvements in these areas every six months .
if progress is n't evident , eu aid will be withdrawn . insufficient administration preparation could lead to cuts in agricultural subsidies , for example , and reductions in agricultural exports may result if inadequate veterinary controls persist . the judicial system , particularly in bulgaria , is another area that needs attention , according to reports , and a stop on judicial cooperation with other members could be enforced if underlying corruption remains . " it is a very tense period .
we are in the delivery year .
but i believe out country will prove that we can and will be good members of the european union , " said bulgaria 's prime minister sergei stanishev . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims to revive european constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on monday that his country intends to map out a timetable for the european union 's constitution by the end of its eu presidency in 2007 .

in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .

the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .
all that leaves dr. z 's fans with a good chance of seeing him back on television screens sometime soon . susan stone / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling . " art experts have said that the paintings are of moderate artistic merit and remarkable only for the signature they carry : ah or a. hitler . questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to auction the works of the mastermind of the holocaust . " there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler . " touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis labelled much art as , including that of otto dix , " degenerate " the sale of hitler or nazi memorabilia is a sensitive issue , and larger auction houses with a reputation to defend traditionally steer clear of offering such items . the upcoming sale has also divided lostwithiel , where special security measures will be in place during the auction . " i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

" other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling . " art experts have said that the paintings are of moderate artistic merit and remarkable only for the signature they carry : ah or a. hitler . questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to auction the works of the mastermind of the holocaust . " there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler . " touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis labelled much art as , including that of otto dix , " degenerate " the sale of hitler or nazi memorabilia is a sensitive issue , and larger auction houses with a reputation to defend traditionally steer clear of offering such items . the upcoming sale has also divided lostwithiel , where special security measures will be in place during the auction . " i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .

in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move .

" in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said . " basically it 's a sedative for people , who do n't think about it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

1 , but membership for what will be the bloc 's two poorest countries comes with strings attached . the european commission announced tuesday in strasbourg that bulgaria and romania would join the european union in january , instead of a year later as suggested by some , but has set unprecedented conditions for what will become the union 's 26th and 27th members . the decision , due to be approved by eu member states in october , lists reforms the balkan neighbors must complete to avoid losing full membership benefits , including billions in subsidies and aid . " enlargement fatigue " setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso called for a halt to expansion after 2007 membership for bulgaria and romania was not postponed until 2008 because some officials feared that this could humiliate the countries , which signed accession treaties in 2005 , and lead to an anti-eu backlash . while stating that the countries had improved enough to warrant accession in 2007 , the commission also maintained that further improvement is expected . the countries will have to provide evidence of progress in areas of particular concern to the eu , including corruption , administration of subsidies , food safety and combating organized crime . the eu would halt expansion following the accession of the two balkan states , european commission president jose manuel barroso said monday . " it would be unwise to bring in other member states , apart from romania and bulgaria , before we 've sorted out the whole institutional issue , " barroso .
" we 've got to a point in time where this issue has become increasingly pressing . " constitution question resurfaces while the president 's comments seem to have shut the door on eu hopefuls like croatia and turkey , they also mean a renewed focus on resolving the constitution issue , which had been postponed after the treaty was rejected last year by france and the netherlands . the eu 's current steering document , the nice treaty , allows for 27 member states .
after the union grew to 25 in 2004 , bulgaria and romania are set to fill the last two available slots before the european institutions have to be revised . germany , which is to take over the rotating six-month eu presidency in january , has said it will make the constitutional revision a top priority during its term .
though eu member states are aiming for consensus on the treaty by the end of 2008 , ratification of a new text could take much longer , the euobserver reported . reservations about further enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new member states will have to submit ' progress reports ' every six months romania and bulgaria are set to join the 25-member bloc at a time of weakening support in some eu states for further enlargement and fears of a flood of new job-seeking migrants . most member states are expected to impose restrictions on workers from the two newcomers , as they did when 10 mainly eastern european countries joined in 2004 . britain , which allowed unrestricted access last time , has warned that it is likely to put a cap on immigrants from bulgaria and romania , after half a million eastern europeans have entered the country since 2004 .
romania 's prime minister calin tariceanu , in an interview published monday , said entry into the european union will not spark a wave of mass emigration and appealed to current eu member states to keep their borders open . " free movement of workers should be respected by all member states , " he said . romania , with a population of 22 million , will become the seventh most populous state in the bloc .
together with bulgaria , a country of 8 million , it will be the poorest member state .
per capita output amounts to barely one-third of the eu average .
continued corruption raises concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agricultural subsidies will be at stake if eu conditions are n't met as part of their accession agreement , bulgaria and romania will be obliged to turn in a ' progress report ' about improvements in these areas every six months .
if progress is n't evident , eu aid will be withdrawn . insufficient administration preparation could lead to cuts in agricultural subsidies , for example , and reductions in agricultural exports may result if inadequate veterinary controls persist . the judicial system , particularly in bulgaria , is another area that needs attention , according to reports , and a stop on judicial cooperation with other members could be enforced if underlying corruption remains .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said . " basically it 's a sedative for people , who do n't think about it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo . " " we have advised that a performance could result in disturbances , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski , adding that the theater decided on its own to cut the opera . police emphasized that no concrete threats are known at this time . politicians disapprove of decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata " will replace " idomeneo " interior minister schäuble said monday from washington that the theater 's decision to cancel the work was " crazy " and " unacceptable .

wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .
four performances were planned for neuenfels ' production in november but will be replaced by " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo . " " we have advised that a performance could result in disturbances , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski , adding that the theater decided on its own to cut the opera . police emphasized that no concrete threats are known at this time . politicians disapprove of decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata " will replace " idomeneo " interior minister schäuble said monday from washington that the theater 's decision to cancel the work was " crazy " and " unacceptable . "
wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .
four performances were planned for neuenfels ' production in november but will be replaced by " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling . " art experts have said that the paintings are of moderate artistic merit and remarkable only for the signature they carry : ah or a. hitler . questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to auction the works of the mastermind of the holocaust . " there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler . " touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis labelled much art as , including that of otto dix , " degenerate " the sale of hitler or nazi memorabilia is a sensitive issue , and larger auction houses with a reputation to defend traditionally steer clear of offering such items . the upcoming sale has also divided lostwithiel , where special security measures will be in place during the auction . " i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .
" in doing this , we help perpetuate a pathetic and horrible market in mementoes of the third reich , which falsifies the history of the 20the century , " jones wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retrospective on " hitler 's favorite sculptor " stirs debate a retrospective on arno breker will open in schwerin on july 22 .

30 deadline . german defense minister franz josef jung said monday that eufor , the european union force in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- should not have its mandate extended after it expires at the end of november . " i believe that the deadline will be upheld and the mandate will be able to be fulfilled during the four-month period set by the eu , " said jung , who began a tour of africa sunday in the small red sea country of djibouti . germany is in charge of the 1,000-strong force 's operations in the drc , and has 310 soldiers stationed in the huge central african country 's capital , kinshasa , plus 430 in gabon as reservists for the eufor mission . a further 320 german soldiers are in djibouti as part of the us-led anti-terrorism operation " enduring freedom .

his main rival , vice-president jean-pierre bemba came second with 20.03 percent . recent violence quelled by eu reinforcements the elections were meant to draw a line under a decade of conflict in the former zaire , where a war from 1998 to 2003 sparked a humanitarian crisis that killed more than 4 million people .

three european helicopters and 60 french , portuguese and swedish special forces were immediately deployed from their base in gabon when the fighting broke out , followed by a german-dutch battalion of about 450-500 men a day later . eufor has stopped new civil war , says jung kabila and bemba signed an agreement saturday pledging to make kinshasa a " city without weapons . "
however , un and eu peacekeepers - including german paratroopers , polish military police , and spanish and french troops - continue to patrol the streets of congo 's capital as the truce holds . " we have contributed to preventing a new civil war , " jung said monday . jung expressed confidence that the situation in the drc would remain " relatively calm " after the second round of the presidential election , and said the german soldiers should be able to return home before christmas . the defense minister flew on to gabon late monday and was then due to travel on to kinshasa . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.09.2006 eu condemns spain for hindering e.on 's endesa bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has a lot of work ahead if it wants to prevent protectionism within the bloc the european commission ruled tuesday that spain had breached eu regulations in trying to protect spanish electricity giant endesa from a takeover bid by german energy group e.on. the commission , the eu 's top competition regulator , said the government in madrid had breached competition rules and internal market regulations after its national authorities placed conditions on the german bid . e.on launched an offer in february to buy endesa for 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 37 billion -rrb- and the commission gave the german group the green light in april to press ahead with its takeover plans . but madrid preferred a merger between endesa and the country 's biggest gas supplier , gas natural , and spain 's own competition regulator placed about 19 conditions , most of them contested by the commission , on e.on 's offer .
prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said . " basically it 's a sedative for people , who do n't think about it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo .

wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said . " basically it 's a sedative for people , who do n't think about it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

these days , though , the international star is causing discontent in german music circles for his novel approach to music . " welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .
" people are just upset because it is a lot of change at one time . " a new direction it was not seen as just a new direction for music at the orchestra when rattle was appointed conductor in 2002 , but also a new way of doing business in the arts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle is known for his frizzy locks and electric style bankrupt berlin , with its three major orchestras , transformed the public philharmonic into a quasi-private foundation with increased autonomy in artistic and business matters .
that was a first in germany , where the performing arts are mainly financed - and controlled - by the state . it was also anticipated that the 51-year-old liverpool native , who is credited with revamping birmingham 's orchestra , would shake things up at the berlin philharmonic with his youthful style and willingness to eschew 19th century german romantic standards for more modern and experimental music as well as reach out to the young through school programs . rattle , who is nicknamed feuerkopf or fire-head , has shattered the stereotype of the aloof german conductor .
instead , with a mop of curly hair , an energetic style and an ever-present grin , he has won over audiences with his communicative personality and his trademark mantra that " music is for everyone . " " the thrill is gone " still , in early summer , what was simmering among music circles hit the public after a well-known german music critic called for rattle 's ouster and said he was the cause of the decline at the berlin philharmonic . " we 've grown used to him - the thrill is gone , has yielded to more pedestrian charms , " wrote manuel brug , chief music critic of die welt newspaper .
" we are well-acquainted with his dashing gestures , we 've seen through his permanent expression of ecstasy , which has curdled into a mask in the meantime . " brug also accused rattle of betraying the german sound . " in working with this venerable orchestra , he neglects the great german symphonic tradition ... nor does he set out for distant lands , " he wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle beat out conductor daniel barenboim for the job in the german classical music scene , the philharmonic 's trademark , the " german " sound is one that is rich , dark and romantic in its renditions of the standards from bach , beethoven , bruckner , wagner and strauss . rattle , on the other hand , is bringing in works from the past 80 years such as berg and schönberg .
that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials . " the berlin philharmonic is in superlative shape , " wrote pianist alfred brendel in the british newspaper , the guardian .
" while it has fully retained its richness in romantic symphonies , it has opened itself up to contemporary as well as to 18th-century music in a novel way . " the old and the new the fight over rattle is really a fight between tradition and the new , many say .
it is has impacted a number of artists in germany trying to turn things around , most notably american choreographer william forsythe , who headed the frankfurt ballet from 1984 to 2004 .
the city declined to renew forsythe 's contract after officials decided they wanted a return to more classical ballet productions instead of his modern interpretations . some say that flexibility and variety in the arts is exactly what is needed to bring in younger and more cosmopolitan audiences , but they warn that such efforts might come at the expense of an institution 's prestige . " the berlin philharmonic under simon rattle has not lost its sound , " wrote musicologist christiane tewinkel in berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper .

these days , though , the international star is causing discontent in german music circles for his novel approach to music . " welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .
" people are just upset because it is a lot of change at one time . " a new direction it was not seen as just a new direction for music at the orchestra when rattle was appointed conductor in 2002 , but also a new way of doing business in the arts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle is known for his frizzy locks and electric style bankrupt berlin , with its three major orchestras , transformed the public philharmonic into a quasi-private foundation with increased autonomy in artistic and business matters .
that was a first in germany , where the performing arts are mainly financed - and controlled - by the state . it was also anticipated that the 51-year-old liverpool native , who is credited with revamping birmingham 's orchestra , would shake things up at the berlin philharmonic with his youthful style and willingness to eschew 19th century german romantic standards for more modern and experimental music as well as reach out to the young through school programs . rattle , who is nicknamed feuerkopf or fire-head , has shattered the stereotype of the aloof german conductor .
instead , with a mop of curly hair , an energetic style and an ever-present grin , he has won over audiences with his communicative personality and his trademark mantra that " music is for everyone . " " the thrill is gone " still , in early summer , what was simmering among music circles hit the public after a well-known german music critic called for rattle 's ouster and said he was the cause of the decline at the berlin philharmonic . " we 've grown used to him - the thrill is gone , has yielded to more pedestrian charms , " wrote manuel brug , chief music critic of die welt newspaper .
" we are well-acquainted with his dashing gestures , we 've seen through his permanent expression of ecstasy , which has curdled into a mask in the meantime . " brug also accused rattle of betraying the german sound . " in working with this venerable orchestra , he neglects the great german symphonic tradition ... nor does he set out for distant lands , " he wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle beat out conductor daniel barenboim for the job in the german classical music scene , the philharmonic 's trademark , the " german " sound is one that is rich , dark and romantic in its renditions of the standards from bach , beethoven , bruckner , wagner and strauss . rattle , on the other hand , is bringing in works from the past 80 years such as berg and schönberg .
that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials . " the berlin philharmonic is in superlative shape , " wrote pianist alfred brendel in the british newspaper , the guardian .
" while it has fully retained its richness in romantic symphonies , it has opened itself up to contemporary as well as to 18th-century music in a novel way . " the old and the new the fight over rattle is really a fight between tradition and the new , many say .
it is has impacted a number of artists in germany trying to turn things around , most notably american choreographer william forsythe , who headed the frankfurt ballet from 1984 to 2004 .
the city declined to renew forsythe 's contract after officials decided they wanted a return to more classical ballet productions instead of his modern interpretations . some say that flexibility and variety in the arts is exactly what is needed to bring in younger and more cosmopolitan audiences , but they warn that such efforts might come at the expense of an institution 's prestige . " the berlin philharmonic under simon rattle has not lost its sound , " wrote musicologist christiane tewinkel in berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper . " someone like sir simon rattle , who says that if he believes in anything , it 's that ' this music is for everyone ' , is right on one hand , " she wrote .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo . " " we have advised that a performance could result in disturbances , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski , adding that the theater decided on its own to cut the opera . police emphasized that no concrete threats are known at this time . politicians disapprove of decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata " will replace " idomeneo " interior minister schäuble said monday from washington that the theater 's decision to cancel the work was " crazy " and " unacceptable . "
wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .
four performances were planned for neuenfels ' production in november but will be replaced by " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2006 daimler-chrysler 's " dr. z " becomes icon despite massive losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter " dr. z " zetsche 's popular television commercials have not helped daimler-chrysler despite becoming a cult tv star in the us , daimlerchrysler 's chairman dieter zetsche could n't stop the automotive giant from posting massive third quarter losses in september . it 's been a mixed few days for daimlerchrysler and it chairman , dieter zetsche .
the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .
all that leaves dr. z 's fans with a good chance of seeing him back on television screens sometime soon . susan stone / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said . " basically it 's a sedative for people , who do n't think about it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo . " " we have advised that a performance could result in disturbances , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski , adding that the theater decided on its own to cut the opera . police emphasized that no concrete threats are known at this time . politicians disapprove of decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata " will replace " idomeneo " interior minister schäuble said monday from washington that the theater 's decision to cancel the work was " crazy " and " unacceptable . "
wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "
despite the strong support for the new laws , a demonstration was held in zurich on monday night to denounce them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.09.2006 romania , bulgaria get go-ahead for eu membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission gave their approval to romania and bulgaria for accession the european commission gave the green light tuesday for bulgaria and romania to join the eu on jan .
1 , but membership for what will be the bloc 's two poorest countries comes with strings attached . the european commission announced tuesday in strasbourg that bulgaria and romania would join the european union in january , instead of a year later as suggested by some , but has set unprecedented conditions for what will become the union 's 26th and 27th members . the decision , due to be approved by eu member states in october , lists reforms the balkan neighbors must complete to avoid losing full membership benefits , including billions in subsidies and aid . " enlargement fatigue " setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso called for a halt to expansion after 2007 membership for bulgaria and romania was not postponed until 2008 because some officials feared that this could humiliate the countries , which signed accession treaties in 2005 , and lead to an anti-eu backlash . while stating that the countries had improved enough to warrant accession in 2007 , the commission also maintained that further improvement is expected . the countries will have to provide evidence of progress in areas of particular concern to the eu , including corruption , administration of subsidies , food safety and combating organized crime . the eu would halt expansion following the accession of the two balkan states , european commission president jose manuel barroso said monday . " it would be unwise to bring in other member states , apart from romania and bulgaria , before we 've sorted out the whole institutional issue , " barroso .
" we 've got to a point in time where this issue has become increasingly pressing . " constitution question resurfaces while the president 's comments seem to have shut the door on eu hopefuls like croatia and turkey , they also mean a renewed focus on resolving the constitution issue , which had been postponed after the treaty was rejected last year by france and the netherlands . the eu 's current steering document , the nice treaty , allows for 27 member states .
after the union grew to 25 in 2004 , bulgaria and romania are set to fill the last two available slots before the european institutions have to be revised . germany , which is to take over the rotating six-month eu presidency in january , has said it will make the constitutional revision a top priority during its term .
though eu member states are aiming for consensus on the treaty by the end of 2008 , ratification of a new text could take much longer , the euobserver reported . reservations about further enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new member states will have to submit ' progress reports ' every six months romania and bulgaria are set to join the 25-member bloc at a time of weakening support in some eu states for further enlargement and fears of a flood of new job-seeking migrants . most member states are expected to impose restrictions on workers from the two newcomers , as they did when 10 mainly eastern european countries joined in 2004 . britain , which allowed unrestricted access last time , has warned that it is likely to put a cap on immigrants from bulgaria and romania , after half a million eastern europeans have entered the country since 2004 .
romania 's prime minister calin tariceanu , in an interview published monday , said entry into the european union will not spark a wave of mass emigration and appealed to current eu member states to keep their borders open . " free movement of workers should be respected by all member states , " he said . romania , with a population of 22 million , will become the seventh most populous state in the bloc .

though eu member states are aiming for consensus on the treaty by the end of 2008 , ratification of a new text could take much longer , the euobserver reported . reservations about further enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new member states will have to submit ' progress reports ' every six months romania and bulgaria are set to join the 25-member bloc at a time of weakening support in some eu states for further enlargement and fears of a flood of new job-seeking migrants . most member states are expected to impose restrictions on workers from the two newcomers , as they did when 10 mainly eastern european countries joined in 2004 . britain , which allowed unrestricted access last time , has warned that it is likely to put a cap on immigrants from bulgaria and romania , after half a million eastern europeans have entered the country since 2004 .
romania 's prime minister calin tariceanu , in an interview published monday , said entry into the european union will not spark a wave of mass emigration and appealed to current eu member states to keep their borders open . " free movement of workers should be respected by all member states , " he said . romania , with a population of 22 million , will become the seventh most populous state in the bloc .
together with bulgaria , a country of 8 million , it will be the poorest member state .
per capita output amounts to barely one-third of the eu average .
continued corruption raises concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agricultural subsidies will be at stake if eu conditions are n't met as part of their accession agreement , bulgaria and romania will be obliged to turn in a ' progress report ' about improvements in these areas every six months .
if progress is n't evident , eu aid will be withdrawn . insufficient administration preparation could lead to cuts in agricultural subsidies , for example , and reductions in agricultural exports may result if inadequate veterinary controls persist . the judicial system , particularly in bulgaria , is another area that needs attention , according to reports , and a stop on judicial cooperation with other members could be enforced if underlying corruption remains . " it is a very tense period .
we are in the delivery year .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling . " art experts have said that the paintings are of moderate artistic merit and remarkable only for the signature they carry : ah or a. hitler . questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to auction the works of the mastermind of the holocaust . " there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler . " touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis labelled much art as , including that of otto dix , " degenerate " the sale of hitler or nazi memorabilia is a sensitive issue , and larger auction houses with a reputation to defend traditionally steer clear of offering such items . the upcoming sale has also divided lostwithiel , where special security measures will be in place during the auction . " i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .
" in doing this , we help perpetuate a pathetic and horrible market in mementoes of the third reich , which falsifies the history of the 20the century , " jones wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retrospective on " hitler 's favorite sculptor " stirs debate a retrospective on arno breker will open in schwerin on july 22 .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling . " art experts have said that the paintings are of moderate artistic merit and remarkable only for the signature they carry : ah or a. hitler . questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to auction the works of the mastermind of the holocaust . " there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler .

" i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .

the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .
all that leaves dr. z 's fans with a good chance of seeing him back on television screens sometime soon . susan stone / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "
despite the strong support for the new laws , a demonstration was held in zurich on monday night to denounce them .
protesters said switzerland should be ashamed of itself . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de switzerland battens down the hatches against foreigners swiss voters on sunday approved legislation that would give their country some of the most restrictive legislation on asylum seekers in europe , sparking criticism from papers around europe .

" welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .
" people are just upset because it is a lot of change at one time .

" we are well-acquainted with his dashing gestures , we 've seen through his permanent expression of ecstasy , which has curdled into a mask in the meantime . " brug also accused rattle of betraying the german sound .

that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials . " the berlin philharmonic is in superlative shape , " wrote pianist alfred brendel in the british newspaper , the guardian .
" while it has fully retained its richness in romantic symphonies , it has opened itself up to contemporary as well as to 18th-century music in a novel way . " the old and the new the fight over rattle is really a fight between tradition and the new , many say .
it is has impacted a number of artists in germany trying to turn things around , most notably american choreographer william forsythe , who headed the frankfurt ballet from 1984 to 2004 .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .

" i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.09.2006 romania , bulgaria get go-ahead for eu membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission gave their approval to romania and bulgaria for accession the european commission gave the green light tuesday for bulgaria and romania to join the eu on jan .
1 , but membership for what will be the bloc 's two poorest countries comes with strings attached . the european commission announced tuesday in strasbourg that bulgaria and romania would join the european union in january , instead of a year later as suggested by some , but has set unprecedented conditions for what will become the union 's 26th and 27th members . the decision , due to be approved by eu member states in october , lists reforms the balkan neighbors must complete to avoid losing full membership benefits , including billions in subsidies and aid . " enlargement fatigue " setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso called for a halt to expansion after 2007 membership for bulgaria and romania was not postponed until 2008 because some officials feared that this could humiliate the countries , which signed accession treaties in 2005 , and lead to an anti-eu backlash . while stating that the countries had improved enough to warrant accession in 2007 , the commission also maintained that further improvement is expected . the countries will have to provide evidence of progress in areas of particular concern to the eu , including corruption , administration of subsidies , food safety and combating organized crime . the eu would halt expansion following the accession of the two balkan states , european commission president jose manuel barroso said monday . " it would be unwise to bring in other member states , apart from romania and bulgaria , before we 've sorted out the whole institutional issue , " barroso .
" we 've got to a point in time where this issue has become increasingly pressing . " constitution question resurfaces while the president 's comments seem to have shut the door on eu hopefuls like croatia and turkey , they also mean a renewed focus on resolving the constitution issue , which had been postponed after the treaty was rejected last year by france and the netherlands . the eu 's current steering document , the nice treaty , allows for 27 member states .
after the union grew to 25 in 2004 , bulgaria and romania are set to fill the last two available slots before the european institutions have to be revised . germany , which is to take over the rotating six-month eu presidency in january , has said it will make the constitutional revision a top priority during its term .
though eu member states are aiming for consensus on the treaty by the end of 2008 , ratification of a new text could take much longer , the euobserver reported . reservations about further enlargement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new member states will have to submit ' progress reports ' every six months romania and bulgaria are set to join the 25-member bloc at a time of weakening support in some eu states for further enlargement and fears of a flood of new job-seeking migrants . most member states are expected to impose restrictions on workers from the two newcomers , as they did when 10 mainly eastern european countries joined in 2004 . britain , which allowed unrestricted access last time , has warned that it is likely to put a cap on immigrants from bulgaria and romania , after half a million eastern europeans have entered the country since 2004 .
romania 's prime minister calin tariceanu , in an interview published monday , said entry into the european union will not spark a wave of mass emigration and appealed to current eu member states to keep their borders open . " free movement of workers should be respected by all member states , " he said . romania , with a population of 22 million , will become the seventh most populous state in the bloc .
together with bulgaria , a country of 8 million , it will be the poorest member state .
per capita output amounts to barely one-third of the eu average .
continued corruption raises concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agricultural subsidies will be at stake if eu conditions are n't met as part of their accession agreement , bulgaria and romania will be obliged to turn in a ' progress report ' about improvements in these areas every six months .
if progress is n't evident , eu aid will be withdrawn . insufficient administration preparation could lead to cuts in agricultural subsidies , for example , and reductions in agricultural exports may result if inadequate veterinary controls persist . the judicial system , particularly in bulgaria , is another area that needs attention , according to reports , and a stop on judicial cooperation with other members could be enforced if underlying corruption remains . " it is a very tense period .
we are in the delivery year .
but i believe out country will prove that we can and will be good members of the european union , " said bulgaria 's prime minister sergei stanishev . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims to revive european constitution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on monday that his country intends to map out a timetable for the european union 's constitution by the end of its eu presidency in 2007 .

some say they 're forgeries , but collectors from around the world have apparently expressed their interest . adolf hitler apparently painted the watercolors while he was serving in the german army during world war i , after which they were hidden away for more than 60 years . the 21 paintings and sketches - mainly portraying landscapes , churches , woodland and houses - have attracted strong interest from collectors in russia , the united states and south africa . collectors are unlikely to be the only ones present when the works are auctioned off on tuesday in the quiet town of lostwithiel .
television crews ranging from the bbc to al jazeera have announced they will report on the event in cornwall . " people have been ringing up every day about it , " ian morris , auctioneer at jefferys , told reuters news agency . expecting a large audience , the auctioning house switched the sale from its showroom to a local hotel to allow more space for bidders . possible forgeries " it 's very unusual to have that number of hitler 's watercolors up for auction , " morris said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auction houses tend to steer clear of nazi memorabilia he told german news agency dpa that " if it was n't for who painted them , they would probably not be worthy of selling . " art experts have said that the paintings are of moderate artistic merit and remarkable only for the signature they carry : ah or a. hitler . questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate to auction the works of the mastermind of the holocaust . " there has been a minority of people who are unhappy , " morris told reuters .
" there are always people who have reservations about what 's being sold . " the british newspaper the guardian wrote that works were likely to be forgeries .
" to my eye , " wrote art critic jonathan jones , " these are crude and obvious forgeries " and " a forger 's clumsy attempt to copy the dreary style of one of the world 's worst artists . " the pictures are believed to have been painted between 1915 and 1918 , on the border of france and belgium where hitler was a corporal during world war i. the artworks were supposedly discovered in 1986 , having been stored away in an attic in belgium for decades . according to the times of london , research undertaken in belgium appeared to prove that the works were indeed by hitler , but the people who worked on that research had since died , making it impossible to verify their findings . jefferys has catalogued the paintings as being " attributed to a. hitler . " touchy subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazis labelled much art as , including that of otto dix , " degenerate " the sale of hitler or nazi memorabilia is a sensitive issue , and larger auction houses with a reputation to defend traditionally steer clear of offering such items . the upcoming sale has also divided lostwithiel , where special security measures will be in place during the auction . " i 'd be uncomfortable making money out of them because of who they 're by , " john truman , the owner of a local antique shop , told the times . however , jefferys auctioneers apparently sold a hitler watercolor for 5,200 pounds -lrb- 7,730 euros or $ 9,790 -rrb- in november 2005 . for tuesday 's auction , morris told reuters that he hoped one or two of the 21 watercolors would sell for more than 5,000 pounds . as a boy , adolf hitler wanted to become an artist , but was turned down twice by vienna 's academy of fine arts .
he did , however , continue to paint until the outbreak of war in 1914 , and after he returned to civilian life . the guardian 's art critic was skeptical of both the auction and reporting about it .
" in doing this , we help perpetuate a pathetic and horrible market in mementoes of the third reich , which falsifies the history of the 20the century , " jones wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retrospective on " hitler 's favorite sculptor " stirs debate a retrospective on arno breker will open in schwerin on july 22 .

the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .
all that leaves dr. z 's fans with a good chance of seeing him back on television screens sometime soon . susan stone / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "
despite the strong support for the new laws , a demonstration was held in zurich on monday night to denounce them .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

prior to e.on making its offer , gas natural made a bid of 22.5 billion euros for endesa . " the commission will uphold its right to apply the eu 's merger control rules to the benefit of all companies and all citizens within the single market , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . spanish ambitions the eu ruling , which is legally binding but can be contested in the european court of justice , is a setback for spanish hopes to build a national champion in the energy sector to protect the industry from foreign influence .
it also means conditions placed on e.on 's offer are now illegal and that the german group can ignore them and , if it chooses , take court action against the spanish government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commission head jose barroso has warned that protectionism within the eu is unacceptable those conditions included the divestment of substantial , mainly nuclear , assets , representing 35 percent of endesa 's spanish-based installation capacity . spain 's industry minister told reporters on monday that madrid was likely to comply with the ruling .
e.on still wants endesa brussels condemned madrid under article 21 of an eu treaty that gives it alone the right to authorize or block a merger in the 25-country union , and which stops national authorities from over-turning its decision . in a " reasoned opinion , " it also ruled that spain had contravened eu internal market regulations by unduly restricting " free movement of capital " and the " right of establishment , " laid down in the bloc 's treaties . a " reasoned opinion " is the final step before taking action at the european court of justice if a country does not comply .
in this case , however , the commission has left open the possibility for talks . although the ruling is a victory for e.on , the bid was complicated after the spanish public works group acciona bought 10 percent of endesa , as it appears to be moving toward building up major stake .
that would put pressure on e.on to increase its bid for endesa or force it into an uncomfortable alliance with acciona . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on has n't lost interest in endesa shares in e.on fell sharply in early trading in frankfurt on tuesday after the sale , in which acciona paid an estimated 3.38 billion euros , was announced . but the german firm said it still wanted to acquire endesa despite the surprise move . " e.on reaffirms its strong commitment to pursuing its offer for endesa and expects to quickly fulfill all the necessary requirements to do so , " the company said in a statement . spanish economy and finance minister pedro solbes said that his government " neither supported nor opposed " acciona 's acquisition . for his part , acciona 's director for development , juan muro-lara , said the company 's investment " does not reflect a desire to exercise control over decisions at endesa .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .

" the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo . " " we have advised that a performance could result in disturbances , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski , adding that the theater decided on its own to cut the opera . police emphasized that no concrete threats are known at this time . politicians disapprove of decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata " will replace " idomeneo " interior minister schäuble said monday from washington that the theater 's decision to cancel the work was " crazy " and " unacceptable . "
wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .
four performances were planned for neuenfels ' production in november but will be replaced by " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata .

" welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .

that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

" to avoid endangering the public and its employees , the deutsche oper in berlin has decided to refrain from showing " idomeneo " in november , " the opera house said . as early as july , security officials had warned of the security risk associated with the opera .
a risk analysis was prepared , which formed the basis of the opera house 's decision to cancel " idomeneo . " " we have advised that a performance could result in disturbances , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski , adding that the theater decided on its own to cut the opera . police emphasized that no concrete threats are known at this time . politicians disapprove of decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata " will replace " idomeneo " interior minister schäuble said monday from washington that the theater 's decision to cancel the work was " crazy " and " unacceptable . "
wolfgang börnsen , the culture and media spokesman for the conservative parties in parliament , compared canceling the show to an " act of prostration to the terrorists . " the theater 's announcement will " encourage the radical scene to increase pressure and threats against christianity and the occidental culture , " börnsen added . neuenfels , who describes surrealist artist max ernst as his " spiritual father , " is already known for his provocative work .
his " idomeneo " already stirred up hefty protests when it premiered in 2003 . clash of cultures and religions in the epilogue , idomeneo , the king of crete , comes on stage comes on stage with a bloody sack in his hand .
he then pulls the heads of poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed out of the sack and places them triumphantly on four chairs . neuenfels said he could understand the decision of the theater directors , but added they should n't let themselves be intimidated , the berliner morgenpost reported tuesday . the sturm und drang opera , set in the capital of crete just after the trojan war , addresses human resistance to making sacrifices to the gods .
mozart 's original version premiered in 1781 .
four performances were planned for neuenfels ' production in november but will be replaced by " the marriage of figaro " and " la traviata .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said .

the law also states that the maximum detention period for those awaiting deportation would be raised to 24 months and welfare benefits would be denied to rejected asylum seekers . under eu laws , " the request for asylum can be accelerated in the case of an individual who has no passports , but that can not be a reason for ruling that the person can not be admitted , " a commission justice affairs spokesperson said .
asked if what switzerland wants to be accepted is therefore incompatible with the bloc 's standards , the spokesman said : " yes , it is . " swiss to be forced to adopt some eu laws although switzerland is not a member of the european union , it is expected to join the eu-dominated schengen border free zone along with the 10 newest eu countries that became member states in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss border controls will feed info to an eu database switzerland will then have to adopt some but not all of the eu 's legislation , notably on finger-printing asylum seekers so that the information can be recorded in the bloc 's eurodac data system . but bern is under no obligation to apply most of the other eu texts harmonizing asylum rights among its member countries . the commission spokesperson said that the eu 's 25 member states have to respect " a whole set of legislation on asylum . "
this includes conditions for hosting asylum seekers , a definition of what constitutes refugee status and rules on the asylum procedure . new laws break un refugee rules the united nations refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also denounced the vote and described the measures as " among the strictest in europe . "
international refugee rules which have been in place since 1951 say that immigrants and asylum seekers should not be shut out of the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss voters also spoke out against non-eu workers last year swiss supporters of the law say that the stringent measures are necessary to avoid social tensions in the future , curb the burden on welfare services and protect genuine asylum cases while the swiss radical party , which backed the laws , said the policy would " help integration and prepare the future of the country . " highly-skilled refugees only the measures , which would block all but the most highly-skilled workers from outside the eu or the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- from entering the rich alpine country , was backed by around three-quarters of voters .
they were initially approved by the swiss parliament in december but a coalition of centre-left parties , church groups and humanitarian organizations forced the government to put the measures to a national vote . socialist swiss member of parliament maria roth bernasconi said the vote was a failure for those who supported the initiative .
" they made a mistake , " she added .
" they think the issue is settled now , but that 's not true .
i regret that those parties played the game , putting to one side the values of humanity and openness which are important for switzerland . "

the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .

"
however , un and eu peacekeepers - including german paratroopers , polish military police , and spanish and french troops - continue to patrol the streets of congo 's capital as the truce holds .

the automobile industry giant celebrated the opening of a new factory in china last week , but at the same time suffered unexpectedly high third quarter losses . this is especially rough for zetsche , whose tough restructuring plans landed him the top job in the first place .
in recent months , zetsche , nicknamed " dr. z " has also become the star of a controversial marketing campaign in the us , becoming a cult-figure in a strategy aimed at bringing out the " german-ness " of the chrysler brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr.z 's web site got over 500,000 hits in the first month in one of the ads dr. z holds open the door of a daimlerchrysler vehicle open , zetsche invites an american reporter in and gives him a trip with speeds to match the german autobahn and a crash test to show off the car 's safety features while extolling the virtues of the transatlantic automotive partnership . other commercials show the good doctor pulling a quality award from the folding compartment of a mom 's minivan , skillfully deflecting a soccer ball with his head , getting yelled at by a director for forgetting his lines , and putting up with jokes about his most prominent physical feature : " is that moustache real ? " but there 's another , more pertinent question : is a smiling german accent really the way to sell cars and trucks american style ? german-american selling point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america meets germany in daimler 's bremen factory " we have a very unique advantage with daimlerchrysler having the heritage of mercedes linked with chrysler group , " said tom lasorda , the chrysler group president and ceo , said when he introduced the campaign back in june .
" and we 're very , very proud of that .
so when we look at advertising we 're proud of the german-american partnership and the consumers need to know it , and we 'll use that going forward . " however , jean halliday , who covers the automotive industry for advertising age magazine , said while the commercials are amusing , the message is unclear . " there are many americans who do not know who dieter zetsche is , " she said .
" there was some research i found in my reporting that 80 percent of americans who saw the ads thought the character was a made up person .
they did n't realize he was really the chair of daimlerchrysler ag . " other critics complained that zetsche 's silly behavior in the ads was inappropriate for the chairman of an international conglomerate , though that would probably be less of a concern if the ads sold cars . but halliday said - when looking at the numbers - they did n't .
when the ads were pulled earlier this month , there was talk that the campaign had been a dud . daimlerchrysler denies ad failure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third quarter losses have the company under a cloud christine mackenzie , the executive director of multi-brand marketing & agency relations , for the chrysler group , said it 's not a sign of failure that the high profile " dr. z " ads were abruptly stopped in september when it became clear that too much inventory and low sales were more pressing issues . " we have to be very spontaneous and flexible , and that 's the whole reason for taking down the ' dr. z ' ads and replacing them with clearance spots , " mackenzie said . dr. z 's commercials may not have sold many cars , but he did enter the lexicon as a pop culture icon - both hated and loved . pop icon soars higher than car sales an online cartoonist compared his antics to a drunken circus monkey , and one web graffiti artist altered an ad to show zetsche in a nazi uniform .
internet users bashed and praised the man with the moustache on message boards , and posted close to 6 million questions on the " ask dr. z " web site .
for chrysler 's marketing division , that is a sign of success . yet dr. z does n't quite seem to have all the answers .
late last week , chrysler group announced an expected loss of 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- in the third quarter - more than double what it had previously forecasted . in a company meeting in stuttgart , a group of reporters asked dr. z how he was going to find a cure for the problems facing chrysler , which zetsche said was hard hit by shift away from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when gas prices went up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler-chrysler 's cars are not flying off the forecourt " i think our first task is to stay with our basic conviction that we are on the way to recovery with the chrysler group , and that it 's about taking different aspects of our business to benchmark levels - between productivity , quality , and appeal of our vehicles and so on , " zetsche replied .
" most importantly , we must build the brand .
and this is by far where we have the biggest gap still . " the multi-tasking dieter zetsche was installed to stabilize the company , build market share , and personify a successful merger .
all that leaves dr. z 's fans with a good chance of seeing him back on television screens sometime soon . susan stone / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

they may also bring items , including beverages , purchased in a secure boarding area onto the aircraft , tsa announced monday . tsa first implemented the ban on all liquids , gels and aerosols in august , after uk officials uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic flights bound for the united states with liquid explosives . but according to wolfgang mayrhuber , chief executive of german carrier lufthansa , more needs to be done .
mayrhuber said that safety measures at airport controls should be modernized . " we need more intelligent approaches , " mayrhuber told the german daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" we ca n't catch terrorists by rummaging through handbags .
that is a completely illusory notion . " biometric data for better security mayrhuber said he recommended the introduction of biometric features , such as fingerprints , facial measurements and iris controls .
these patterns are reduced to mathematical algorithms and can be stored on a chip in a passenger 's passport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has begun testing biometric systems he said this data could be added to the information airlines already receive from customers . " with this , we could effectively shorten the check-in time at the airports , " he said .
" we could achieve higher security and higher comfort . " lufthansa has begun tests with a biometric system , in which passengers are issued tickets encoded with their thumbprint data .
they can then check themselves in by placing their thumbs on a machine . mayrhuber said any systems used to identify passengers would have to be internationally recognized and comparable , though not identical . " those are acceptable tools , " he said .
" then a passenger flying to the united states does n't have to fill out any forms anymore . "
currently , travelers heading to a us destination are required to fill out several forms for us entry . higher technology does n't infringe on individual privacy mayrhuber said he did n't think such measures would violate the privacy of individuals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scan systems can identify people by their eye patterns " this data is already collected today , " he said .
" in bangkok , my face is automatically photographed when i enter and leave the country . " manually recording such data has a larger danger for error than if an integrated system is created and determines when the data is to be destroyed , he said . the current system of hand-checking passengers ' bags was not suitable , mayrhuber said .

these days , though , the international star is causing discontent in german music circles for his novel approach to music . " welcome sir simon , " read some of the hundreds of placards hanging around berlin four years ago in anticipation of the new british conductor 's first concert with the world-renowned berlin philharmonic orchestra . at the time , musicians , critics and the public hailed the hiring as step in a new direction for the storied and conservative orchestra , one that would breathe new life into the institution and move it forward . these days , though , there is increasing discontent in and out of the orchestra , with calls for rattle to leave .
critics say he is the cause of decline at the institution with his more open and more modern approach to music at the expense of german standards . others say this latest cultural controversy is typical of germany , a country famous for its ability to attract artistic talent from around the world .
germans , the theory goes , want something fresh and new , but once they get it , they 'd rather revert back to the evergreens . " it is good what -lrb- rattle -rrb- is doing , because the orchestra needs to move along , not linger in the old traditions , " said one berlin classical musician .
" people are just upset because it is a lot of change at one time . " a new direction it was not seen as just a new direction for music at the orchestra when rattle was appointed conductor in 2002 , but also a new way of doing business in the arts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle is known for his frizzy locks and electric style bankrupt berlin , with its three major orchestras , transformed the public philharmonic into a quasi-private foundation with increased autonomy in artistic and business matters .
that was a first in germany , where the performing arts are mainly financed - and controlled - by the state . it was also anticipated that the 51-year-old liverpool native , who is credited with revamping birmingham 's orchestra , would shake things up at the berlin philharmonic with his youthful style and willingness to eschew 19th century german romantic standards for more modern and experimental music as well as reach out to the young through school programs . rattle , who is nicknamed feuerkopf or fire-head , has shattered the stereotype of the aloof german conductor .
instead , with a mop of curly hair , an energetic style and an ever-present grin , he has won over audiences with his communicative personality and his trademark mantra that " music is for everyone . " " the thrill is gone " still , in early summer , what was simmering among music circles hit the public after a well-known german music critic called for rattle 's ouster and said he was the cause of the decline at the berlin philharmonic . " we 've grown used to him - the thrill is gone , has yielded to more pedestrian charms , " wrote manuel brug , chief music critic of die welt newspaper .
" we are well-acquainted with his dashing gestures , we 've seen through his permanent expression of ecstasy , which has curdled into a mask in the meantime . " brug also accused rattle of betraying the german sound . " in working with this venerable orchestra , he neglects the great german symphonic tradition ... nor does he set out for distant lands , " he wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rattle beat out conductor daniel barenboim for the job in the german classical music scene , the philharmonic 's trademark , the " german " sound is one that is rich , dark and romantic in its renditions of the standards from bach , beethoven , bruckner , wagner and strauss . rattle , on the other hand , is bringing in works from the past 80 years such as berg and schönberg .
that prompted one reporter at a may press conference to tell rattle that he is defiling the trademark of the orchestra . the conductor , who once said that he would not return " time and again to the same old war horses " replied , " i 'm sorry if that is the case . " meanwhile , rattle 's home papers are defending him in articles and editorials . " the berlin philharmonic is in superlative shape , " wrote pianist alfred brendel in the british newspaper , the guardian .
" while it has fully retained its richness in romantic symphonies , it has opened itself up to contemporary as well as to 18th-century music in a novel way . " the old and the new the fight over rattle is really a fight between tradition and the new , many say .
it is has impacted a number of artists in germany trying to turn things around , most notably american choreographer william forsythe , who headed the frankfurt ballet from 1984 to 2004 .
the city declined to renew forsythe 's contract after officials decided they wanted a return to more classical ballet productions instead of his modern interpretations . some say that flexibility and variety in the arts is exactly what is needed to bring in younger and more cosmopolitan audiences , but they warn that such efforts might come at the expense of an institution 's prestige . " the berlin philharmonic under simon rattle has not lost its sound , " wrote musicologist christiane tewinkel in berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper . " someone like sir simon rattle , who says that if he believes in anything , it 's that ' this music is for everyone ' , is right on one hand , " she wrote .
" on the other , however , he is mistaken about the extent to which classical music continues to thrive on distinction and on the concept of elitism .
all this threatens its brand essence : is the philharmonic really an everyman 's orchestra ?

for women , it is 81.6 years , and 76 years for men - up nearly three and four years , respectively , since 1990 . germans are healthier and living longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , remained in parliament until his death at 91 germans are healthier than ever , according to the 220-page report , but german health minister ulla schmidt warned , " they are still much too fat , exercise too little , smoke excessively , and drink too much alcohol . " in europe , north america and japan longevity has steadily increased since 1840 , climbing 2.5 years every decade , and shows no signs of stopping , according to james vaupel , head of the max planck institute for longevity in rostock . " if the present trend continues , half of infants who were born in the year 2000 will live to see 2100 , compared to less than 1 percent at the turn of the last century , who lived to 100 , " vaupel said . lifestyle factors more important than genes longevity can not be chalked up to what genes children inherit , and has renewed the nature vs. nurture debate over which influences are predominant , vaupel added .
the prevailing view among scientists is that how long one 's parents or even identical twin has lived , has generally little to do with one 's own life expectancy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even identical twins die more than 10 years apart " identical twins on average die within 10 or 11 years of each other .
the gap between siblings , who share half their genes , is 12 years , and for non-related individuals from the same community , it is 14 years .
that 's not a whole lot more , " vaupel said . furthermore , the genetic component for two of the leading natural causes of death - heart disease and cancer - is almost negligible .
over 90 percent of all cancers have environmental , not hereditary , causes , including radiation , chemicals and pollution , while medical advances have been made in treating heart disease over the last few decades . " maybe you 're unfortunate enough to inherit the apoe4 gene , which predisposes you to heart disease and alzheimer 's , but you can do something about it , " vaupel said .
" proper diet and exercise can suppress the bad effects of certain genes .
the bottom line is that lifestyle factors are far more important in determining longevity than genes . " gap between eastern and western germany shrinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the longevity of those who grew up in the east has now reached the level of the west german reunification in 1990 provided a natural laboratory for determining the impact of better nutrition , medical care and living conditions on the longevity of former east germans . the life spans of men and women , who grew up in the german democratic republic jumped by nearly five years to reach west german levels between 1990 and 2002 , whereas west germans experienced gains of 2.5 years over the same period of time . impact of aging society on labor policy the demographic implications of a graying society , where the elderly are living longer and healthier lives , compounded by the low fertility rate of 1.36 per woman in germany , is already having an impact on the government 's labor policies , as the working population ages and gradually declines . this month , " initiative 50plus " was launched by german labor minister franz müntefering , who at 66 is past the retirement age for public servants .
the initiative attempts to counteract age discrimination and encourages employers to give older unemployed workers a chance to re-enter the job market , to be re-trained and to stay employed longer . nearly three-quarters of all employers in germany no longer hire people over the age of 50 , according to the institute for employment research . redistribution of work among broader age range bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister franz müntefering 's " initiative 50plus " was launched this month " policies of the last few decades have strongly encouraged older workers to go into early retirement with generous financial incentives , in order to make room for a younger generation , " said bernd katzenstein , spokesman for the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- .
" but this has n't done anything to reduce unemployment among the young . " with better health and longevity , many of those above 60 , want to continue working , " he said . work needs to be redistributed among all age brackets , including those over 60 , and more part-time work options need to be made available , vaupel added . " this way it 's possible to balance work , leisure and family in varying amounts in each phase of life , without so much of the burden falling on 30-50 year olds , who are in the prime of their working lives and raising younger children , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

using the mathematical equation , australian scientists could calculate a woman 's risk with 75 % accuracy .
the researchers , writing in the journal radiology , said the formula could help inform treatment for women with the bone disease .
osteoporosis sufferers are more likely to suffer fractures because their bones are less dense than healthy people 's . "

wrists , hips and the spine are the most common sites for fractures in people with osteoporosis .
a range of treatments exist , including hormone replacement therapy , vitamin d and calcium supplements , and non-hormonal medicines .
the team from the university of melbourne looked at 231 women with osteoporosis who had suffered bone fractures and 448 women who had not .
the scientists discovered that factors such as bone density levels in the spine and hip , weight , and the number of previous fractures sustained were related to the likelihood of breaking a bone .
by taking these measurements into account , the team was able to develop a predictive formula .
fractures to increase the study 's lead author , margaret henry , a statistician at the university of melbourne , said : " we have derived an equation that successfully predicted 75 % of fractures in women , two years after their initial measurements were taken .
" as the average age of the population increases , the number of fractures attributable to osteoporosis is set to increase dramatically .
" the ability to predict fracture risk , based on simple clinical measurements , will assist in targeting treatment for people at highest risk , thus helping reduce the burden of this disease . "
the group now plan to develop a similar equation for men with osteoporosis .
a spokeswoman for the national osteoporosis society said : " there is a lot of work being done in this area because we know that measuring bone density is not the perfect predictor of who will go on to break bones because of osteoporosis .
" the world health organization is due to publish an international report drawing together all the other risk factors that play a part in assessing how likely it is that someone will break a bone over a 10 year period .
" in this way we should have a much more accurate way of trying to prevent the broken bones that generally affect the hip and spine and which can have such a major impact on people 's quality of life . "

using the mathematical equation , australian scientists could calculate a woman 's risk with 75 % accuracy .
the researchers , writing in the journal radiology , said the formula could help inform treatment for women with the bone disease .
osteoporosis sufferers are more likely to suffer fractures because their bones are less dense than healthy people 's .
we have derived an equation that successfully predicted 75 % of fractures in women margaret henry , university of melbourne it mainly affects women after the menopause , but men and younger people can get osteoporosis too .
wrists , hips and the spine are the most common sites for fractures in people with osteoporosis .
a range of treatments exist , including hormone replacement therapy , vitamin d and calcium supplements , and non-hormonal medicines .
the team from the university of melbourne looked at 231 women with osteoporosis who had suffered bone fractures and 448 women who had not .
the scientists discovered that factors such as bone density levels in the spine and hip , weight , and the number of previous fractures sustained were related to the likelihood of breaking a bone .
by taking these measurements into account , the team was able to develop a predictive formula .
fractures to increase the study 's lead author , margaret henry , a statistician at the university of melbourne , said : " we have derived an equation that successfully predicted 75 % of fractures in women , two years after their initial measurements were taken .
" as the average age of the population increases , the number of fractures attributable to osteoporosis is set to increase dramatically .
" the ability to predict fracture risk , based on simple clinical measurements , will assist in targeting treatment for people at highest risk , thus helping reduce the burden of this disease . "
the group now plan to develop a similar equation for men with osteoporosis .
a spokeswoman for the national osteoporosis society said : " there is a lot of work being done in this area because we know that measuring bone density is not the perfect predictor of who will go on to break bones because of osteoporosis .
" the world health organization is due to publish an international report drawing together all the other risk factors that play a part in assessing how likely it is that someone will break a bone over a 10 year period .
" in this way we should have a much more accurate way of trying to prevent the broken bones that generally affect the hip and spine and which can have such a major impact on people 's quality of life . "

atc lasham , at the aerospace wales park at raf st athan , has begun a 30-day consultation period with its 30 staff .
last october , the firm was part of plans to create hundreds of jobs at the site .
it now blames uncertainty over the future of the site for its cuts .
the assembly government says it has been working with the firm on an offer for long-term occupancy at st athan .
atc lasham , which maintains boeing aircraft , moved into one of the main hangars at st athan last year .
at the time , the decision by atc lasham and another firm was heralded as a major development which could create up to 300 new jobs .
it came after the axing of hundreds of jobs at the base , which houses the defence aviation repair agency , following the loss of a repairs contract .
atc lasham said it was to use the 100,000 sq ft -lrb- 9,300 sq m -rrb- " twin peaks " building , which has the capacity to house up to four boeing 737 or two boeing 757/767 aircraft at the same time .
the firm said it would create 50 new aircraft maintenance jobs initially , building up to 250-300 jobs over the following 18 months .

the number of call-outs during june , july and august rose by more than 100 to almost 700 this year , says the rnli .
rhyl was the uk 's busiest coastal lifeboat station , with 78 launches .
the rescue charity said regular hot days played a part in its rising workload .
rnli sea safety manager nicola davies said : " we are certainly seeing more people down on the beaches . "
across the uk , the rnli reported a 4 % rise in callouts over the summer compared to the same three months in 2005 .
in wales the corresponding figure is an 18 % increase .
busiest stations in summer 2006 rhyl : 78 launches tenby : 57 launches mumbles : 35 launches beaumaris : 32 launches porthcawl : 30 launches about 70 % of the summer launches were by inshore lifeboats , fast and rapid response vessels better suited to dealing with incidents close to the shore .
the charity said this reflected the fact that more people than ever are using the sea for a range of leisure pursuits such as kite-surfing , water-biking , kayaking , and coasteering , in addition to more traditional activities such as sailing and angling .
in wales , tenby , mumbles and beaumaris were the next busiest stations , while llandudno 's inshore lifeboat crew saw their number of call-outs rise from seven last year to 26 last summer .
' seaside resorts ' on the south coast , porthcawl and burry port both saw their number of inshore lifeboat call-outs almost double from 17 and 8 respectively in 2005 , to 30 and 15 respectively this year .
the rise in shoreline-based emergencies reflected the growing popularity of using the sea for pleasure , said ms davies , a co-ordinator of the rnli 's education campaigns in wales and the west of england .
she said : " we 've had some really good weather and we 're certainly seeing more people using the water .
" there is a much easier access to water-based activities and to cheaper or pre-owned equipment more and more people now use the sea for leisure .
" the majority of people enjoy their water sports without getting into trouble but our busiest coastal stations are located in the busiest seaside resorts . "
the number of call-outs in wales during june , july and august rose from 583 in 2005 to 686 in 2006 .

the number of call-outs during june , july and august rose by more than 100 to almost 700 this year , says the rnli .
rhyl was the uk 's busiest coastal lifeboat station , with 78 launches .
the rescue charity said regular hot days played a part in its rising workload .
rnli sea safety manager nicola davies said : " we are certainly seeing more people down on the beaches . "
across the uk , the rnli reported a 4 % rise in callouts over the summer compared to the same three months in 2005 .
in wales the corresponding figure is an 18 % increase .
busiest stations in summer 2006 rhyl : 78 launches tenby : 57 launches mumbles : 35 launches beaumaris : 32 launches porthcawl : 30 launches about 70 % of the summer launches were by inshore lifeboats , fast and rapid response vessels better suited to dealing with incidents close to the shore .
the charity said this reflected the fact that more people than ever are using the sea for a range of leisure pursuits such as kite-surfing , water-biking , kayaking , and coasteering , in addition to more traditional activities such as sailing and angling .
in wales , tenby , mumbles and beaumaris were the next busiest stations , while llandudno 's inshore lifeboat crew saw their number of call-outs rise from seven last year to 26 last summer .
' seaside resorts ' on the south coast , porthcawl and burry port both saw their number of inshore lifeboat call-outs almost double from 17 and 8 respectively in 2005 , to 30 and 15 respectively this year .
the rise in shoreline-based emergencies reflected the growing popularity of using the sea for pleasure , said ms davies , a co-ordinator of the rnli 's education campaigns in wales and the west of england .
she said : " we 've had some really good weather and we 're certainly seeing more people using the water .
" there is a much easier access to water-based activities and to cheaper or pre-owned equipment more and more people now use the sea for leisure .

lt gen winai phattiyakul said the army intervened because of the likelihood of clashes between supporters and opponents of the former prime minister .
he described the army as being badly divided before last week 's coup .
and he accused ousted pm thaksin shinawatra of planning to use elements of the military against the opposition .
while last week 's coup has been widely welcomed in thailand , it has been condemned by most western governments as a step backwards .
' could not wait ' the generals who seized power have so far made their case for intervention mainly through official statements read out on national television .
but , in an exclusive interview with the bbc , lt gen winai phattiyakul described the overthrow of mr thaksin as more of a political change than a coup .
he said the army could not afford to wait for elections scheduled for later this year because that would not have solved the crisis .
he painted an alarming picture of violent clashes between pro- and anti-thaksin demonstrators and he said the army had been badly divided over the crisis .
" there would be more clashes between pro-thaksin and anti-thaksin demonstrators .
if we let that happen again , we do n't know how many lives we would lose , " he said .
he promised that existing curbs on civil liberties would only be for a short time , and insisted the military had acted reluctantly and would not view this coup as a precedent for interventions in the future .
" mr thaksin has been in power for many years and has a lot of influence ...
we did n't want to take any risks .
restrictions on some reports in the media are just for a very short space of time , " he said .

bloomberg news agency reported that she said " well , that 's a lie " when she heard the chancellor saying it had been a privilege to work with tony blair .
however mrs blair told reporters : " honestly , guys , i hate to spoil your story , but i did n't say it and i do n't believe it either . "
but bloomberg says it stands by the story and has refused to retract it .
downing street earlier described the report that mrs blair had accused mr brown of lying as " untrue and rubbish " .
no 10 said she was accompanied by four people , none of whom heard her say anything .
' not even there ' the alleged incident reportedly took place as mr brown addressed labour 's annual conference in manchester on monday , in what was billed as his pitch for the party leadership .
bloomberg said mrs blair 's comments came as she walked through the conference exhibition area , past televisions playing mr brown 's speech .
bloomberg said she appeared unaware that one of its reporters was within earshot .
carolin lotter , a producer with bloomberg , told bbc news she had been " not more than a metre or two " away from mrs blair and that she " literally had to step out of the way " .
" everybody was watching , everybody could listen to it , and she was just walking by one of the screens when i heard her say ' well , that 's a lie ' , " ms lotter said . "
the fact is that no version of this story is true and bloomberg should withdraw it immediately " downing street spokeswoman a downing street spokeswoman said : " this story is totally untrue .
" bloomberg first claimed mrs blair stormed out of the hall and flashed that story on their screens .
" when the story was totally denied on mrs blair 's behalf and it was pointed out that she had not at any time been in the hall , bloomberg conveniently changed their story .
" the fact is that no version of this story is true and bloomberg should withdraw it immediately .
" mrs blair was accompanied by four people , two of whom were protection officers , none of whom heard her say anything . "
but a spokeswoman for bloomberg insisted the story would not be retracted .
" we stand by our reporting , " she said .
" the story speaks for itself . "
the incident has threatened the attempted united front attempted by the labour leadership this week .
angela eagle , a labour mp seen as a supporter of gordon brown , said it was " tittle-tattle " which had been denied .
she told bbc radio 4 's today she preferred to talk about the substance of what was in mr brown 's speech rather than indulge in " gossip " .

on 11 september all second life users were asked to change their password following a successful attack on one of the virtual world 's core databases .
second lifers contacted the bbc saying they had not been given enough detail about what was exposed to hackers .
but second life 's bosses said they had done everything to keep users informed .
life lessons the malicious hackers got into a database holding the names , addresses , personal information and scrambled credit card numbers of about 650,000 users of the virtual world .
they reportedly broke in via a third-party web program .
linden lab , creators of second life , said it took the precaution of making all users change their password because it only knew the total size of the data stolen rather than its specifics .
some second life users who contacted the bbc took linden to task over its handling of the breach .
" to say i 'm unhappy with the way linden labs have dealt with it is an understatement , " said one second life member who asked to remain anonymous .
she criticised the fact that linden lab even maintained a database that kept scrambled credit card numbers alongside the names and addresses of second lifers .
the loss of the personal details would also likely prove useful to criminals , she said .
" almost all the information you need for budding identity theft , " she said .
there were fears that details for credit cards used to pay for second life accounts have been grabbed by criminals .
linden had also proved " unhelpful " when she tried to get more details about what had happened and how the credit card data was scrambled .
second life is a fantastical take on the real world regular second lifer jo twist also said there was widespread agreement that linden had handled the incident badly rather than the fact it happened .
" generally , people are expecting these kinds of breaches to happen in this day and age despite best efforts to protect systems , " she said .
on many second life discussion boards members asked for far more details about what had been compromised and what could be done with the information .
some feared that the loss of personal information would be used to link second life avatars with real people - a situation that could have serious consequences for many .
philip rosedale , chief executive and founder of linden lab , defended the way that the aftermath of the security breach had been handled .
he said linden told users about its fears that data had been lost on the same day it discovered that the information may have gone astray .
" we do n't have any positive proof that anything was taken , only proof that someone was logged into our system , " he said .
" we erred on the side of caution in informing users as soon as possible . "
following the breach , he said , linden was changing procedures so far less personal data on second life members was kept .
sensitive data was being protected with stronger encryption .
he added that so far there was no evidence that credit cards used to pay for second life or personal information about its members was being abused .
he concluded : " we would compare our performance on this with anyone who has suffered a similar security breach . "

on 11 september all second life users were asked to change their password following a successful attack on one of the virtual world 's core databases .
second lifers contacted the bbc saying they had not been given enough detail about what was exposed to hackers .
but second life 's bosses said they had done everything to keep users informed .
life lessons the malicious hackers got into a database holding the names , addresses , personal information and scrambled credit card numbers of about 650,000 users of the virtual world .
they reportedly broke in via a third-party web program .
linden lab , creators of second life , said it took the precaution of making all users change their password because it only knew the total size of the data stolen rather than its specifics .
some second life users who contacted the bbc took linden to task over its handling of the breach .
" to say i 'm unhappy with the way linden labs have dealt with it is an understatement , " said one second life member who asked to remain anonymous .
she criticised the fact that linden lab even maintained a database that kept scrambled credit card numbers alongside the names and addresses of second lifers .
the loss of the personal details would also likely prove useful to criminals , she said .

" generally , people are expecting these kinds of breaches to happen in this day and age despite best efforts to protect systems , " she said .
on many second life discussion boards members asked for far more details about what had been compromised and what could be done with the information .
some feared that the loss of personal information would be used to link second life avatars with real people - a situation that could have serious consequences for many .
