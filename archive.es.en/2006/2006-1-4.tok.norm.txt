the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

gazprom has argued that the price hike is necessary to keep up with international market rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom chief alexei miller speaking in moscow , alexei miller , head of gazprom , told a news conference the deal was effective from jan 1 .

" this agreement will ensure stable supplies to europe . " ivchenko said the deal would settle all sticking points . " we have reached an initially acceptable agreement which gives us the possibility to meet the gas needs of ukraine and the transit of russian gas to europe , " ivchenko said . deal to ukraine 's advantage ? after bitter wrangling over the gas prices for months , the final deal actually seems to have worked out in ukraine 's favor . ivchenko told the news conference that - after mixing in supplies from turkmenistan and kazakhstan - kiev would actually pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters at the russian border . the russian-ukrainian agreement also foresees an increase in fees for gas transit rights that russia pays ukraine for its pipelines bringing gas to european countries .
about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute . " russia apparently developed cold feet in the face of a looming " europe-ization " and hit the emergency brake , " said jilge . " the russians could just about save face .
ukraine realized how to represent its interests through the clever intervention of the eu , " jilge said , adding that kiev 's stance was an indication that it was n't just symbolic policy , but rather substantial progress and results that mattered to kiev on its much-touted " way to europe .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .
shortly before my departure i film the outside of camp delta .
ambulances drive repeatedly into the camp .
as i arrive back in washington the pentagon announces new facts regarding guantanamo : the number of prisoners on hunger strike has increased to 84 . stephan bachenheimer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops allegedly posed as journalists for interview the german ministry of defense has admitted that it is carrying out an internal inquiry into the possible extracting of information on suspected terrorists by bundeswehr operatives posing as journalists in bosnia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 search for causes of ice rink disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions have arised whether the heavy snowfall was solely to blame rescue workers continue looking for a missing woman in the debris of a collapsed ice rink in the german alps , as the search for the tragedy 's cause intensifies .
the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .
a supermarket collapsed in the czech republic tuesday evening , injuring one person . also on tuesday , the roof of a warehouse in aying near munich collapsed under the weight of the snow .
no one was injured .
in salzburg , austria , the roof of a bowling alley caved in .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .
shortly before my departure i film the outside of camp delta .
ambulances drive repeatedly into the camp .
as i arrive back in washington the pentagon announces new facts regarding guantanamo : the number of prisoners on hunger strike has increased to 84 . stephan bachenheimer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops allegedly posed as journalists for interview the german ministry of defense has admitted that it is carrying out an internal inquiry into the possible extracting of information on suspected terrorists by bundeswehr operatives posing as journalists in bosnia .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .

" even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .

constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .

we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .

then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "

" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate europe -pipe- 04.01.2006 moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas supplies can now flow unhindered to both ukraine and europe russia and ukraine struck a five-year gas supply deal wednesday , ending a long-standing fractious dispute over pricing and designed to guarantee supplies to kiev as well as to europe . officials from russian energy giant gazprom and its ukraine counterpart naftogaz said wednesday they had agreed on a five-year deal under which kiev will buy gas at the russian border at a rate of $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . the new price amounts to a huge rise from the $ 50 that ukraine had been paying until now , a remnant of the subsidized soviet-era pricing system .
gazprom has argued that the price hike is necessary to keep up with international market rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom chief alexei miller speaking in moscow , alexei miller , head of gazprom , told a news conference the deal was effective from jan 1 . " we have reached a final agreement , it is successful for gazprom and we are satisfied , " miller told reporters after talks with oleksiy ivchenko , head of naftogaz .
" this agreement will ensure stable supplies to europe . " ivchenko said the deal would settle all sticking points . " we have reached an initially acceptable agreement which gives us the possibility to meet the gas needs of ukraine and the transit of russian gas to europe , " ivchenko said . deal to ukraine 's advantage ? after bitter wrangling over the gas prices for months , the final deal actually seems to have worked out in ukraine 's favor . ivchenko told the news conference that - after mixing in supplies from turkmenistan and kazakhstan - kiev would actually pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters at the russian border . the russian-ukrainian agreement also foresees an increase in fees for gas transit rights that russia pays ukraine for its pipelines bringing gas to european countries .
about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute . " russia apparently developed cold feet in the face of a looming " europe-ization " and hit the emergency brake , " said jilge . " the russians could just about save face .
ukraine realized how to represent its interests through the clever intervention of the eu , " jilge said , adding that kiev 's stance was an indication that it was n't just symbolic policy , but rather substantial progress and results that mattered to kiev on its much-touted " way to europe .

gazprom has argued that the price hike is necessary to keep up with international market rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom chief alexei miller speaking in moscow , alexei miller , head of gazprom , told a news conference the deal was effective from jan 1 . " we have reached a final agreement , it is successful for gazprom and we are satisfied , " miller told reporters after talks with oleksiy ivchenko , head of naftogaz .
" this agreement will ensure stable supplies to europe . " ivchenko said the deal would settle all sticking points . " we have reached an initially acceptable agreement which gives us the possibility to meet the gas needs of ukraine and the transit of russian gas to europe , " ivchenko said . deal to ukraine 's advantage ? after bitter wrangling over the gas prices for months , the final deal actually seems to have worked out in ukraine 's favor . ivchenko told the news conference that - after mixing in supplies from turkmenistan and kazakhstan - kiev would actually pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters at the russian border . the russian-ukrainian agreement also foresees an increase in fees for gas transit rights that russia pays ukraine for its pipelines bringing gas to european countries .
about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute . " russia apparently developed cold feet in the face of a looming " europe-ization " and hit the emergency brake , " said jilge . " the russians could just about save face .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi . " these terrorists are considered to be extremely dangerous , especially when returning from iraq , " said german terrorism expert , elmar thevessen .

according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .
" the fact that germany trains iraqi police is an issue which has consequences for the country ’ s security . " european intelligence experts say that in the last two years , at least 300 western european muslims have gone to iraq to pursue " jihad " or holy war against the west .
if they are n't killed , their radical beliefs are often strengthened , raising the risk that they will seek to carry on their struggle in europe . meanwhile , the intelligence community is grappling to cope with this threat .
according to the former anti-terrorism advisor to the us government , richard clarke , monitoring the activities of returning insurgents is difficult . " you ca n't follow them around the clock , " clark said .

in 2010 , a hungarian and a german town are supposed to fill the spot .
european capital of culture is a coveted title .
those towns lucky enough to win it cash in on eu funds they can use to restore city centers and finance cultural programs .
in germany , the winners also receive state and federal funds .
the german candidates , the industrial city of essen and the medieval town of görlitz , could both a financial influx to good use .
three countries meet three cultures , languages and nations - germany , poland and the czech republic - meet near görlitz .
the city 's leaders see the town as a model for the process of european integration .
görlitz applied to be a capital of culture in conjunction with its sister city zgorzelec , across the neisse river in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essen is a monument to germany 's industrial past " trans-nationalism , multiculturalism and bilingualism , " said markus josten , spokesman for the görlitz 2010 campaign .
" that is , we value bilingualism ; we want to build bridges , bridges to the east , bridges to our neighbors .
and where if not here do we have the opportunity to become a laboratory of european cultural integration . "
ruhr metropolis essen plans to represent the entire industrial ruhr valley basin , and the area 's 53 communities are all part of the application .
the ruhr basin is the third-biggest urban agglomeration in europe , and around 5.3 million people from 140 countries live there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantokratoras church in patras , greece swiss author adolf muschg , who was on the german jury , expressed surprise at how the city exudes optimism for the future instead of just the dust of its industrial past .
dormant coal mines have become cultural venues .
bicycle paths run past old industrial complexes that have been converted into museums .
" change through culture - culture through change " is essen 's slogan . hungary has already named the town of pecs as its choice for 2010 .
but germany could n't decide between the top contenders , so the committees from essen and görlitz have to wait for an independent jury to make the choice in brussels in april . meanwhile , the greek port city of patras is this year 's european capital of culture .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .
shortly before my departure i film the outside of camp delta .
ambulances drive repeatedly into the camp .
as i arrive back in washington the pentagon announces new facts regarding guantanamo : the number of prisoners on hunger strike has increased to 84 . stephan bachenheimer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops allegedly posed as journalists for interview the german ministry of defense has admitted that it is carrying out an internal inquiry into the possible extracting of information on suspected terrorists by bundeswehr operatives posing as journalists in bosnia .

in 2010 , a hungarian and a german town are supposed to fill the spot .
european capital of culture is a coveted title .
those towns lucky enough to win it cash in on eu funds they can use to restore city centers and finance cultural programs .
in germany , the winners also receive state and federal funds .
the german candidates , the industrial city of essen and the medieval town of görlitz , could both a financial influx to good use .
three countries meet three cultures , languages and nations - germany , poland and the czech republic - meet near görlitz .
the city 's leaders see the town as a model for the process of european integration .
görlitz applied to be a capital of culture in conjunction with its sister city zgorzelec , across the neisse river in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essen is a monument to germany 's industrial past " trans-nationalism , multiculturalism and bilingualism , " said markus josten , spokesman for the görlitz 2010 campaign .
" that is , we value bilingualism ; we want to build bridges , bridges to the east , bridges to our neighbors .
and where if not here do we have the opportunity to become a laboratory of european cultural integration . "
ruhr metropolis essen plans to represent the entire industrial ruhr valley basin , and the area 's 53 communities are all part of the application .
the ruhr basin is the third-biggest urban agglomeration in europe , and around 5.3 million people from 140 countries live there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantokratoras church in patras , greece swiss author adolf muschg , who was on the german jury , expressed surprise at how the city exudes optimism for the future instead of just the dust of its industrial past .
dormant coal mines have become cultural venues .
bicycle paths run past old industrial complexes that have been converted into museums .
" change through culture - culture through change " is essen 's slogan . hungary has already named the town of pecs as its choice for 2010 .
but germany could n't decide between the top contenders , so the committees from essen and görlitz have to wait for an independent jury to make the choice in brussels in april . meanwhile , the greek port city of patras is this year 's european capital of culture .
the festivities begin with an exhibition about leonardo da vinci on jan .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi . " these terrorists are considered to be extremely dangerous , especially when returning from iraq , " said german terrorism expert , elmar thevessen .
" the london bombings have shown that they can attack targets that are next to impossible to effectively protect . " germany a target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings were carried out by british-born islamic extremists the mainly young muslim men in question were either born , or grew up in europe , can speak one or more european languages , and are capable of blending in with their western surroundings . although germany is not directly involved in the fighting in iraq and also risked a serious breach in relations with the united states over the iraq war , it is actively involved with the international stabilization forces in afghanistan and also helps train iraqi police outside of iraq .
according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .
" the fact that germany trains iraqi police is an issue which has consequences for the country ’ s security . " european intelligence experts say that in the last two years , at least 300 western european muslims have gone to iraq to pursue " jihad " or holy war against the west .
if they are n't killed , their radical beliefs are often strengthened , raising the risk that they will seek to carry on their struggle in europe . meanwhile , the intelligence community is grappling to cope with this threat .
according to the former anti-terrorism advisor to the us government , richard clarke , monitoring the activities of returning insurgents is difficult . " you ca n't follow them around the clock , " clark said .
" you can keep on coming back to them , maybe listen in to their phone calls .
but it 's always possible that they 're building sleeper cells that intelligence officers know nothing about .

earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind .

at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .

" the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty .

instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .
and when it does happen , it usually ends well , " said ipsen . " we should consider ourselves lucky .

what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .

they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .

most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .

" their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident .

" the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 german unemployment spurs debate about solutions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : what is the best strategy for fighting unemployment in germany ?
in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi .

according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .
" the fact that germany trains iraqi police is an issue which has consequences for the country ’ s security . " european intelligence experts say that in the last two years , at least 300 western european muslims have gone to iraq to pursue " jihad " or holy war against the west .
if they are n't killed , their radical beliefs are often strengthened , raising the risk that they will seek to carry on their struggle in europe . meanwhile , the intelligence community is grappling to cope with this threat .
according to the former anti-terrorism advisor to the us government , richard clarke , monitoring the activities of returning insurgents is difficult . " you ca n't follow them around the clock , " clark said .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi . " these terrorists are considered to be extremely dangerous , especially when returning from iraq , " said german terrorism expert , elmar thevessen .
" the london bombings have shown that they can attack targets that are next to impossible to effectively protect . " germany a target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings were carried out by british-born islamic extremists the mainly young muslim men in question were either born , or grew up in europe , can speak one or more european languages , and are capable of blending in with their western surroundings . although germany is not directly involved in the fighting in iraq and also risked a serious breach in relations with the united states over the iraq war , it is actively involved with the international stabilization forces in afghanistan and also helps train iraqi police outside of iraq .
according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .
" the fact that germany trains iraqi police is an issue which has consequences for the country ’ s security . " european intelligence experts say that in the last two years , at least 300 western european muslims have gone to iraq to pursue " jihad " or holy war against the west .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate europe -pipe- 04.01.2006 moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas supplies can now flow unhindered to both ukraine and europe russia and ukraine struck a five-year gas supply deal wednesday , ending a long-standing fractious dispute over pricing and designed to guarantee supplies to kiev as well as to europe . officials from russian energy giant gazprom and its ukraine counterpart naftogaz said wednesday they had agreed on a five-year deal under which kiev will buy gas at the russian border at a rate of $ 230 -lrb- 191 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . the new price amounts to a huge rise from the $ 50 that ukraine had been paying until now , a remnant of the subsidized soviet-era pricing system .
gazprom has argued that the price hike is necessary to keep up with international market rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom chief alexei miller speaking in moscow , alexei miller , head of gazprom , told a news conference the deal was effective from jan 1 . " we have reached a final agreement , it is successful for gazprom and we are satisfied , " miller told reporters after talks with oleksiy ivchenko , head of naftogaz .
" this agreement will ensure stable supplies to europe . " ivchenko said the deal would settle all sticking points . " we have reached an initially acceptable agreement which gives us the possibility to meet the gas needs of ukraine and the transit of russian gas to europe , " ivchenko said . deal to ukraine 's advantage ? after bitter wrangling over the gas prices for months , the final deal actually seems to have worked out in ukraine 's favor . ivchenko told the news conference that - after mixing in supplies from turkmenistan and kazakhstan - kiev would actually pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters at the russian border . the russian-ukrainian agreement also foresees an increase in fees for gas transit rights that russia pays ukraine for its pipelines bringing gas to european countries .
about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute . " russia apparently developed cold feet in the face of a looming " europe-ization " and hit the emergency brake , " said jilge . " the russians could just about save face .
ukraine realized how to represent its interests through the clever intervention of the eu , " jilge said , adding that kiev 's stance was an indication that it was n't just symbolic policy , but rather substantial progress and results that mattered to kiev on its much-touted " way to europe . " europe 's heavy reliance on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia turned off the taps earlier this week the accord settles a rancorous dispute between moscow and kiev that saw deliveries to ukraine cut off sunday , a move which had the knock-on effect of reducing supplies to the key european market which relies on russia for a quarter of its gas needs . the dispute has also highlighted europe 's growing reliance on russian gas . gazprom is the world 's largest gas company and controls a third of all global natural gas reserves , and the vast majority of deliveries to europe - where germany is the biggest importer and france , poland and italy also heavily reliant on it - pass through ukraine . the face-saving deal also comes hours before an eu emergency meeting in brussels in response to the supply crisis and how to deal with potential future supply threats . the european commission , the bloc 's executive arm , had called on both ukraine and russia to return to the negotiating table . " we expect to also establish some form of community solidarity mechanism in the case if there is a gas disruption .
i do n't mean in this particular case , but in general , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told reuters . us concerned by dispute the united states also expressed its concern over the dispute and said us officials were in contact with moscow on the crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the gas dispute has to do with yushchenko 's pro-western stance state department spokesman sean mccormack said that the situation raised questions not only about european energy security but whether russia was using supplies as a political sledgehammer with ukraine 's pro-western president , viktor yushchenko , who was swept to power in the popular " orange revolution " of 2004 . " it 's something that we have raised with the russian government , " mccormack told reporters at the state department 's daily briefing . " it ... raises concerns about the use of energy to exert political pressure .

gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

gazprom has argued that the price hike is necessary to keep up with international market rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom chief alexei miller speaking in moscow , alexei miller , head of gazprom , told a news conference the deal was effective from jan 1 .

about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute . " russia apparently developed cold feet in the face of a looming " europe-ization " and hit the emergency brake , " said jilge . " the russians could just about save face .
ukraine realized how to represent its interests through the clever intervention of the eu , " jilge said , adding that kiev 's stance was an indication that it was n't just symbolic policy , but rather substantial progress and results that mattered to kiev on its much-touted " way to europe .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .
a supermarket collapsed in the czech republic tuesday evening , injuring one person . also on tuesday , the roof of a warehouse in aying near munich collapsed under the weight of the snow .
no one was injured .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .
shortly before my departure i film the outside of camp delta .
ambulances drive repeatedly into the camp .
as i arrive back in washington the pentagon announces new facts regarding guantanamo : the number of prisoners on hunger strike has increased to 84 . stephan bachenheimer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops allegedly posed as journalists for interview the german ministry of defense has admitted that it is carrying out an internal inquiry into the possible extracting of information on suspected terrorists by bundeswehr operatives posing as journalists in bosnia .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi . " these terrorists are considered to be extremely dangerous , especially when returning from iraq , " said german terrorism expert , elmar thevessen .
" the london bombings have shown that they can attack targets that are next to impossible to effectively protect . " germany a target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings were carried out by british-born islamic extremists the mainly young muslim men in question were either born , or grew up in europe , can speak one or more european languages , and are capable of blending in with their western surroundings . although germany is not directly involved in the fighting in iraq and also risked a serious breach in relations with the united states over the iraq war , it is actively involved with the international stabilization forces in afghanistan and also helps train iraqi police outside of iraq .
according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .
" the fact that germany trains iraqi police is an issue which has consequences for the country ’ s security . " european intelligence experts say that in the last two years , at least 300 western european muslims have gone to iraq to pursue " jihad " or holy war against the west .
if they are n't killed , their radical beliefs are often strengthened , raising the risk that they will seek to carry on their struggle in europe . meanwhile , the intelligence community is grappling to cope with this threat .
according to the former anti-terrorism advisor to the us government , richard clarke , monitoring the activities of returning insurgents is difficult . " you ca n't follow them around the clock , " clark said .
" you can keep on coming back to them , maybe listen in to their phone calls .
but it 's always possible that they 're building sleeper cells that intelligence officers know nothing about .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .
it reckons that this shot in the arm will be strong enough to drag the country out of its lethargy . modest growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , germany has one of the lowest growth rates the berlin-based german institute for economic research predicts a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2006 - a somewhat more optimistic view than that of other leading economic think tanks .
most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .
and europe is not a growth powerhouse . " because of gains from a higher value-added tax due to come into force in 2007 , steinherr reckons that germany might finally manage to stick to the eu 's deficit criteria under which member countries are not allowed to borrow more than three percent of gdp annually . possible solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu secretary general ronald pofalla in her new year 's address to the german people , chancellor angela merkel promised to make hiring people cheaper and more attractive to german businesses .
now the conservative chancellor has pledged to put money toward a plan aimed at giving wage subsidies to people who would otherwise be unlikely to ever find a job again . " in our view , it is necessary to support especially long-term unemployed people with little or no qualification , " ronald pofalla , secretary general of merkel 's cdu party said . " their prospects for a job would improve if the state paid part of their wages , " he said . the social democrats , however , are reluctant to share the optimism of their conservative coalition partners in government and are pushing for their own concept of minimum wages to create new jobs . " it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .

most analysts would agree , however , that even 1.7 percent is not enough . " even within the modest european framework , we are at the bottom of the rankings , " said alfred stienherr of the german institute for economic research . " only italy and portugal will have less growth than germany in 2006 .

" it 's important that we produce solutions for work that people can live on , " said spd secretary general hubertus heil . " that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government .

the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "

i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .
a supermarket collapsed in the czech republic tuesday evening , injuring one person . also on tuesday , the roof of a warehouse in aying near munich collapsed under the weight of the snow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 kidnappings raise tough questions about role of state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen : the site of germany 's most recent hostage ordeal following the recent kidnappings and subsequent releases of nationals in iraq and yemen , germany is grappling with a pressing issue - should the state rush to rescue its citizens abroad when their lives are in danger ? it should have been heralded as a happy start to the new year .
instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .
and when it does happen , it usually ends well , " said ipsen . " we should consider ourselves lucky .

instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .
and when it does happen , it usually ends well , " said ipsen . " we should consider ourselves lucky .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

" the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .
shortly before my departure i film the outside of camp delta .
ambulances drive repeatedly into the camp .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .

they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 german unemployment spurs debate about solutions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question remains : what is the best strategy for fighting unemployment in germany ?

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies .

in view of the newly released unemployment figures , which showed a 0.2 percent drop in the adjusted jobless rate , the german government is optimistic about 2006 .
economic pundits , however , would beg to differ . in december 2005 , the german unemployment rate fell to 11.2 percent from 11.4 percent in november , according to seasonally adjusted figures released on tuesday by the german central bank , the bundesbank . the bundesbank - the only institution to calculate the unemployment rate taking into account the effect of seasonal factors on raw economic figures - said that 110,000 fewer people were unemployed in december than in november , bringing the total number of unemployed to 4.638 million . unadjusted raw data released earlier by the federal employment agency showed that the number of unemployed people had risen by 75,000 in the last month of 2005 - less than many analysts had expected . the adjusted data is more closely watched by economists , but the unofficial figures are often cited in the heated debate in germany about unemployment , one of the main weak spots in the economy . the art of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is already claiming improvements on the labor market social democrat and christian democrat lawmakers from the german coalition government have been trying to put a positive spin on the latest job figures . they point out that the 75,000 more jobless people in december 2005 are a major improvement compared with the same period in 2004 , when unemployment figures rose more sharply in december due to a spell of cold weather and seasonally motivated layoffs . figure juggling is common practice whenever new jobless statistics are released .
but this time around the german government is really confident that a turnaround on the job market can be achieved with the economic measures to be taken in the course of this year . berlin is poised to launch a 25-billion euro -lrb- $ 29.6 billion -rrb- investment program to fuel the domestic economy and boost consumer spending .

" that 's why we want a minimum wage to be introduced in the economy that enables all employees to make a decent living . " according to many economists , wage subsidies are better suited to achieve that and could create more than 2 million jobs for low and unskilled workers . skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd secretary general hubertus heil some analysts , however , believe that a subsidized low-wage sector is a bad idea for a deficit-ridden government . " such subsidies must then be paid not only to new employees but also to those who are already earning very small wages , " said economist rolf peffekoven . " this would then come to be extremely expensive for the state , " he said . over the past decade or so , successive german governments have been unable to overcome chronic unemployment here , which reached a post-world war ii record in march 2005 , despite the fact that they 've cut benefits for the jobless and forced them to take on nearly any job offered . many experts believe that perhaps the only way to deal with germany 's unemployment rate is robust economic growth above two percent , which germany has n't seen in years . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth . -lrb- jan 2 , 2006 -rrb- new year holds promise of upswing for germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .
a supermarket collapsed in the czech republic tuesday evening , injuring one person . also on tuesday , the roof of a warehouse in aying near munich collapsed under the weight of the snow .
no one was injured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 kidnappings raise tough questions about role of state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen : the site of germany 's most recent hostage ordeal following the recent kidnappings and subsequent releases of nationals in iraq and yemen , germany is grappling with a pressing issue - should the state rush to rescue its citizens abroad when their lives are in danger ? it should have been heralded as a happy start to the new year .
instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .
and when it does happen , it usually ends well , " said ipsen . " we should consider ourselves lucky .

instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .
and when it does happen , it usually ends well , " said ipsen . " we should consider ourselves lucky .

gazprom has argued that the price hike is necessary to keep up with international market rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom chief alexei miller speaking in moscow , alexei miller , head of gazprom , told a news conference the deal was effective from jan 1 . " we have reached a final agreement , it is successful for gazprom and we are satisfied , " miller told reporters after talks with oleksiy ivchenko , head of naftogaz .
" this agreement will ensure stable supplies to europe . " ivchenko said the deal would settle all sticking points . " we have reached an initially acceptable agreement which gives us the possibility to meet the gas needs of ukraine and the transit of russian gas to europe , " ivchenko said . deal to ukraine 's advantage ? after bitter wrangling over the gas prices for months , the final deal actually seems to have worked out in ukraine 's favor . ivchenko told the news conference that - after mixing in supplies from turkmenistan and kazakhstan - kiev would actually pay $ 95 per 1,000 cubic meters at the russian border . the russian-ukrainian agreement also foresees an increase in fees for gas transit rights that russia pays ukraine for its pipelines bringing gas to european countries .
about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute . " russia apparently developed cold feet in the face of a looming " europe-ization " and hit the emergency brake , " said jilge . " the russians could just about save face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 kidnappings raise tough questions about role of state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen : the site of germany 's most recent hostage ordeal following the recent kidnappings and subsequent releases of nationals in iraq and yemen , germany is grappling with a pressing issue - should the state rush to rescue its citizens abroad when their lives are in danger ? it should have been heralded as a happy start to the new year .
instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media . " what use are travel warnings when deputy foreign ministers themselves consider them superfluous as soon as they quit their posts ? " asked the daily berliner zeitung , implying , like many other papers , that the retired chrobog had acted rashly by traveling to yemen . how long should the state care ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and family after arrival in germany on jan .
1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind . " a good state must take care of its citizens , even if they don ’ t think much of it .
but for how long ? " asked an editorial in the weekly die zeit last week . legal duty to protect citizens , but with limits even as the debate , with all its moral underpinnings , continues this week , experts say the law books provide some answers .
though the state does have a duty to protect its citizens , according to the german constitution , there are limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer was kidnapped and killed after a month and a half in captivity martin kotzur , a leipzig-based expert on international law said the notorious kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer , head of the german employers ' association , by the left-wing terrorist group raf in 1977 , provided a crucial point of reference in the matter .
at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .
" thus there is no legal basis for giving in to the demands of terrorists and kidnappers . " schleyer was eventually murdered by his kidnappers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of susanne osthoff 's release are shrouded in mystery though experts are n't ruling out that the german government may have paid a ransom in certain cases , most recently in osthoff ’ s , the state is in no way legally bound , they say , to exhaust all the resources it has in order to rescue an endangered national . " the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .
chrobog has vehemently denied such accusations . " though there are no direct laws , both the german constitution and the consular law of 1974 make it clear that the government has to help its citizens in need abroad , " said knut ipsen , former president of the german red cross and an expert on international law . " even when citizens travel to countries despite official warnings or consciously court danger , the government ca n't just sit back and ignore them .
it has to intervene . "
however , the government can make citizens pay for their rashness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists kidnapped in the sahara in 2003 were made to pay for their rescue by the government " in such a case , the citizen can be asked to shoulder a higher proportion of the considerable amount of money involved in freeing the person , " said kotzer . " the state has room for some legal maneuvering here . " but he added that since the whole rescue operation usually costs millions of euros , that seldom happens .
" the bill that the individual usually gets just has symbolic value . " “ we are lucky ” notwithstanding the current debate about how far the state should go in bailing out its citizens when they get into danger abroad and how much the process costs the taxpayer , ipsen said germans should be thankful that germany is among the few countries which try everything in their means to secure the release of a citizen . " germany does enjoy a degree of authority and political goodwill abroad .
that 's one of the reasons why kidnapping german nationals is n't a frequent occurrence .
and when it does happen , it usually ends well , " said ipsen . " we should consider ourselves lucky .

instead , reports that jürgen chrobog , a former top diplomat , and his family who were kidnapped in yemen by local tribesmen , were free and had landed safely on german soil , sparked angry reproach in germany ’ s media .

1 , 2006 the chrobogs were the second group of german nationals to be abducted abroad in less than two months .
earlier in november , 43-year-old archaeologist susanne osthoff was seized in iraq and held by an unknown group for three weeks before being released . in both cases , extensive media coverage zoomed in on the kidnapping ordeals , particularly the government 's efforts to secure the hostages ' release .
rumors that berlin may have paid a ransom to kidnappers persist . that in turn has raised some hard-hitting questions about how far the state should go to bail out its citizens in danger abroad , especially when they may have knowingly thrown caution to the wind .

at the time , schleyer 's wife moved the federal constitutional court to ensure that the german government was obliged to fulfill the demands of the terrorists in order to save schleyer 's life . " the court however concluded that although the state had a fundamental duty to protect its citizens , it can not , in any way , be allowed to be blackmailed , particularly when it comes to political blackmail , " said kotzur .

" the decision to help is often taken politically in such a case and is in no way legally-binding , " said kotzur , adding that berlin 's intensive efforts to secure osthoff 's release had more to do with a political and moral necessity rather than a sense of legal duty . " the state has to intervene " the law is also unambiguous , according to experts , on whether the state should still rush to rescue its nationals abroad even when they consciously court danger despite explicit warnings - an issue that has emotions running high at present . both osthoff and chrobog are believed to have taken security warnings too lightly and compromised their personal safety .

in 2010 , a hungarian and a german town are supposed to fill the spot .
european capital of culture is a coveted title .
those towns lucky enough to win it cash in on eu funds they can use to restore city centers and finance cultural programs .
in germany , the winners also receive state and federal funds .
the german candidates , the industrial city of essen and the medieval town of görlitz , could both a financial influx to good use .
three countries meet three cultures , languages and nations - germany , poland and the czech republic - meet near görlitz .
the city 's leaders see the town as a model for the process of european integration .
görlitz applied to be a capital of culture in conjunction with its sister city zgorzelec , across the neisse river in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essen is a monument to germany 's industrial past " trans-nationalism , multiculturalism and bilingualism , " said markus josten , spokesman for the görlitz 2010 campaign .
" that is , we value bilingualism ; we want to build bridges , bridges to the east , bridges to our neighbors .
and where if not here do we have the opportunity to become a laboratory of european cultural integration . "
ruhr metropolis essen plans to represent the entire industrial ruhr valley basin , and the area 's 53 communities are all part of the application .
the ruhr basin is the third-biggest urban agglomeration in europe , and around 5.3 million people from 140 countries live there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantokratoras church in patras , greece swiss author adolf muschg , who was on the german jury , expressed surprise at how the city exudes optimism for the future instead of just the dust of its industrial past .
dormant coal mines have become cultural venues .
bicycle paths run past old industrial complexes that have been converted into museums .
" change through culture - culture through change " is essen 's slogan . hungary has already named the town of pecs as its choice for 2010 .
but germany could n't decide between the top contenders , so the committees from essen and görlitz have to wait for an independent jury to make the choice in brussels in april . meanwhile , the greek port city of patras is this year 's european capital of culture .
the festivities begin with an exhibition about leonardo da vinci on jan .
10 .
luxemburg and sibiu , romania have been chosen for 2007 , liverpool and stavanger , norway for 2008 , and linz , austria and vilnius , lithuania for 2009 . gaby reucher -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .
but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city .
-lrb- march 2 , 2005 -rrb- essen : a changing industrial landscape essen 's motto for the european cultural capital bid is “ change through culture - culture through change . ”
for a city that has undergone many changes in its history , it is an apt slogan .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi . " these terrorists are considered to be extremely dangerous , especially when returning from iraq , " said german terrorism expert , elmar thevessen .
" the london bombings have shown that they can attack targets that are next to impossible to effectively protect . " germany a target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings were carried out by british-born islamic extremists the mainly young muslim men in question were either born , or grew up in europe , can speak one or more european languages , and are capable of blending in with their western surroundings . although germany is not directly involved in the fighting in iraq and also risked a serious breach in relations with the united states over the iraq war , it is actively involved with the international stabilization forces in afghanistan and also helps train iraqi police outside of iraq .
according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .
" the fact that germany trains iraqi police is an issue which has consequences for the country ’ s security . " european intelligence experts say that in the last two years , at least 300 western european muslims have gone to iraq to pursue " jihad " or holy war against the west .
if they are n't killed , their radical beliefs are often strengthened , raising the risk that they will seek to carry on their struggle in europe . meanwhile , the intelligence community is grappling to cope with this threat .
according to the former anti-terrorism advisor to the us government , richard clarke , monitoring the activities of returning insurgents is difficult . " you ca n't follow them around the clock , " clark said .
" you can keep on coming back to them , maybe listen in to their phone calls .
but it 's always possible that they 're building sleeper cells that intelligence officers know nothing about .

" flight 505 , paradise island , departure 2:30 , " reads the monitor in the airport in fort lauderdale , florida .
the line below gives details for a flight with " lynx " airlines .
flight 510 , guantanamo , departure 3:00 .
the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .
six to eight percent of the prisoners are treated for mental illness .
some fashion weapons from things they collect .
once a noose made of the remains of food packaging was found .
a photo shows the proof next to a ruler to illustrate its size .
they tell me about the curiosities of guantanamo .
and about the chinese .
constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .
a woman from " operative security " is continually present , and my interview partner 's eyes keep wandering back and forth to make sure the censor approves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maximum security and isolation cells line a hallway at camp delta eye contact to prisoners the prison gates at camp delta , the high security prison at guantanamo bay , opened twice for me .
delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .
he has to continually assure her that there 's no torture in guantanamo .
but even her teacher treats her unfairly because her father works in guantanamo , the gi said .
grotesque procedure they let me into camp delta the second time , to attend a taliban 's hearing .
a pentagon official briefs me on the most important charges : the prisoner was a trade minister under the taliban and is accused of involvement in the murder of an ecuadorian red cross worker .
i 'm assigned a table in the hearing room and have to sign a paper that says i agree to the rules , which include not crossing my legs , since muslims consider that an affront . " please all rise . "
the three officers who lead the hearing enter the room in which the afghani prisoner is already sitting with his interpreter .
three more soldiers responsible for formalities are there too .
" you can testify under oath , if you prefer .
we 've prepared an islamic oath , " the prisoner is told .
" repeat after me : in the name of allah … " the pseudo-trial decides whether the man will remain in prison .
no lawyer is present .
the greater part of the charges is kept secret .
the officers ' criteria in the trial also remain unclear . the bearded prisoner in white and cream-colored camp uniform speaks with polite restraint : " i 'm already old and weak .
i 've been here three years .
that 's enough for having been taliban trade minister . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghani is carried on a stretcher before being interrogated at camp x-ray in 2002 " in 2003 , mullah omar and osama bin laden decided to join forces , " comes the reply . " that has nothing to do with me , sir .
i was already under arrest .
you gave me that information , " he says . " then why are you here ? " an officer asks him . " the americans blindly threw a stone and i was hit , " he answers and smiles again at the perplexed-looking officers .
shortly before my departure i film the outside of camp delta .
ambulances drive repeatedly into the camp .

the caribbean - and tropical paradise - is only a few hours away from fort lauderdale by plane - as is the nightmare that is guantanamo .
what else can you call a barbed wire prison camp in which detainees have been held for years without charges ?
a gulag of our times , amnesty international says .
the best recruiting tool for al qaeda , says the new york times .
what happens in the camp at guantanamo bay ? the us military gave deutsche welle permission to visit the camp and to film there for three days .
the rules were clear : we can film , but the military reserves the right to view all of our material and - for " security " reasons - censor it . a military escort awaits me when i land in cuba .
from now on i 'm in the care of soldiers from the press office from morning until night .
i do n't leave their sight until i get on the plane back to fort lauderdale .
small-town america in cuba my accommodation is a generous guest house on a street that hardly differs from residential streets anywhere in the us - outside the prison camp the base looks like a small american town .
it 's virtually impossible to pick up a cuban radio station .
instead , i have 45 us cable tv channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guantanamo basics before going to the prison camp , i 'm presented with the most important facts and numbers : the intelligence services view 16 percent of the prisoners as very important , and they are held in a special high security facility .

constant censor the us arrested some chinese men , and now they 'd like to get rid of them .
only , they do n't know how .
the men are ethnic uighurs , a muslim minority from china 's far northwest which does brisk trade in the region bordering on pakistan .
they were picked up in the war against terror and brought to guantanamo .
the men pose no threat to the us .
but they ca n't be deported , because china is afraid of uighur separatists , and guantanamo is a problematic point on a person 's resume .
" china would make organ donors out of them , " said my escort .
the uighurs still live at guantanamo .
the introduction to everyday life in the camp includes talking to prison guards .
we meet in club survivor , a café right next to the camp .
there 's starbucks coffee .
the prisoners throw what the soldiers call cocktails of urine and feces at the guards , i am told .
the guards profess to know nothing about prisoners being tortured or abused here .
the so-called manchester document is used to counter such accusations .
the al qaeda manual that the police found in manchester , england , recommends that if imprisoned you should accuse guards of torture .
there 's no way to investigate whether people were tortured here .
i 'm not allowed to talk to prisoners .
even the talks with the guards take place under supervision .

delta is made up of five individual camps , three of which i 'm allowed to visit .
there 's a concrete and steel prison building for the inmates who the intelligence services consider particularly valuable .
then there are two open camps for prisoners who are cooperative and two stricter camps for prisoners who cause trouble .
i can see prisoners in one of the camps where they 're allowed to move freely within fenced-in areas .
some of the men hide from the camera , others ignore me , and others stare at me penetratingly .
but no one gestures or calls to me . the prison areas that i 'm shown are similar to prisons in the us .
even kitchens and pantries are opened for the camera , to show that guantanamo has high standards .
why , some soldiers ask , does the media try to manipulate the image of guantanamo ?
why does the tv media still show pictures of prisoners at camp x-ray - the first camp which has been closed since then - where the conditions were catastrophic ?
another gi , who was recently sent from giessen , germany to guantanamo , tells me about his daughter who 's going to school in germany .

the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .
a supermarket collapsed in the czech republic tuesday evening , injuring one person . also on tuesday , the roof of a warehouse in aying near munich collapsed under the weight of the snow .
no one was injured .

about 80 percent of russian gas pumped to european consumers takes that route . thus , ukraine will receive $ 1.60 instead of the current $ 1.09 for 1,000 cubic meters per 100 kilometers for gas transportation to western and central europe . wilfried jilge , an expert on central and eastern europe at the university of leipzig told deutsche welle the deal showed that the european union , which had invited both gazprom and naftogaz for talks on wednesday , had played a positive role in the dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2006 search for causes of ice rink disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions have arised whether the heavy snowfall was solely to blame rescue workers continue looking for a missing woman in the debris of a collapsed ice rink in the german alps , as the search for the tragedy 's cause intensifies .
the local prosecutor has begun investigating the incident . about 200 rescuers resumed their work on clearing the debris of the caved ice rink in bad reichenhall on wednesday , with the aid of cranes and excavators .
but hopes were fading of finding the remaining woman trapped under its collapsed roof alive . the district attorney 's office has meanwhile begun an investigation into negligent manslaughter .
but the criminal investigation department in traunstein responsible for the case declined to release any details of the reasons behind the tragedy , which has killed 14 people , mostly children and youth . " it would be pure speculation at this point to say anything about the cause of the accident , " said police chief hubertus andrä .
state prosecutor helmut vordermayer said evidence was being collected and a probe into the accident had been opened . was it just the snow ? many people , both in the region and across the country , are asking themselves how such an accident could have happened .
germany is , after all , well known for its precision engineering and strict regulations . it is currently not clear what caused the flat roof of the building , which dates from the 1970s , to cave in on monday afternoon .
the region is accustomed to heavy snowfall , which some say possibly triggered the roof 's collapse . but there are also reports of inadequate maintenance of the facility and the authorities ' delayed decision to evacuate the rink , just minutes before the roof collapsed . the rink was operated by the city .
bad reichenhall 's mayor wolfgang heitmeier has rejected allegations of negligence for allowing the rink to remain open .
he said the roof had been examined late monday morning to determine whether it could withstand the weight of the snow . heitmeier told reporters the amount of snow was far below the specified limit .
he rejected speculation that the authorities knew of structural problems .
heitmeier said he " could not explain " what caused the collapse . roof 's construction possibly faulty structural engineer hubert widmann from the examination office for structural analysis in munich said the snow alone could not have triggered the accident . " the 30 to 40 centimeters of snow that was on the roof before the collapse could not have caused these catastrophic results alone , " widmann told bavarian radio bayern 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the instability of the remaining structure has hindered rescue efforts engineer markus rapolder told sister station bayern 1 that the roof should have been able to hold the snow masses . " the amount of snow only plays a role when a roof 's construction is defective , " rapolder said .
he said that the weight of the snow was more critical than the amount . " there is light powder snow and heavy sticky snow , " rapolder said .
" if i know that a roof is defective , you should calculate the actual weight of the snow . " " the problem is that there is no legal obligation to control public buildings for damage in the roof construction , " said rapolder .
this was only the case for bridges .
" so you can only hope that owners are informed about possible defects . " further buildings cave in from snow the ongoing snowfall has caused further damage in other parts of the region .

last year 's london bombings , they say , are proof of the homegrown terrorist threat . in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence service said that the highly unstable situation in iraq poses a threat to european countries , including germany . fromm warned that the hundreds of european muslims who have gone to iraq to support iraqi insurgents , and who then return to europe , are a great concern to european security agencies . " these are people who embrace the jihad ideology , " fromm said .
" they can operate weapons and explosives professionally and they have no qualms about killing people .
we would be well advised to keep a very close watch on these people if they should come to germany . " german intelligence officials have been concerned for some time that returning insurgents would consider it an honor to carry out attacks in western europe in the name of the iraqi al qaeda leader , abu musab al zarqawi . " these terrorists are considered to be extremely dangerous , especially when returning from iraq , " said german terrorism expert , elmar thevessen .
" the london bombings have shown that they can attack targets that are next to impossible to effectively protect . " germany a target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings were carried out by british-born islamic extremists the mainly young muslim men in question were either born , or grew up in europe , can speak one or more european languages , and are capable of blending in with their western surroundings . although germany is not directly involved in the fighting in iraq and also risked a serious breach in relations with the united states over the iraq war , it is actively involved with the international stabilization forces in afghanistan and also helps train iraqi police outside of iraq .
according to fromm , this makes germany a potential target . " the threat to germany is very high , " fromm said .

britain 's only native crayfish have been found in meanwood beck at sheepscar , an area usually more noted for traffic congestion than wildlife .
the crustaceans had been restricted to rural areas of the beck due to the poor quality of water downstream .

endangered species biodiversity specialist for the environment agency , martin christmas , said the crayfish , which are protected under european and uk legislation , were discovered at sheepscar during routine checks .

crayfish can be found in a wide range of aquatic habitats , although they are currently under threat from the larger american signal crayfish .

the average temperature was 22.89 c - a rise of more than 1 c from the average in previous years and the highest since records began in 1910 .
environment minister ian campbell admitted the change was " alarming " .
but he defended australia 's decision not to sign the kyoto pledge to cut greenhouse gases .
the annual mean temperature in 2005 was 1.09 c -lrb- 1.96 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- higher than the average between 1961 and 1990 , according to data released on wednesday by the bureau of meteorology .
" while these temperature departures may seem relatively small , a 1c increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern australian towns shifting northward by about 100 km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- , " the bureau said in its annual climate summary .
temperatures in northern australia are usually warmer than in the south .
environment minister ian campbell said climate change was the world 's " number one environmental challenge " .
" these figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real , and it 's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve , " mr campbell told abc news .
but he defended the government 's decision not to sign the kyoto protocol - saying it was inadequate because it failed to include developing countries .
" we need something that includes all countries , " he said .
australia and the us are the only two major industrialised nations to refuse to join the agreement , which calls for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 .

shelter cymru is to appoint a panel of experts to combat housing problems .
the charity 's recent campaigns have claim homelessness in wales has reached new record levels .
the panel of eight commissioners will be announced later this month shelter cymru director john puzey said they would " not be the usual suspects " for the task .
the group will tour wales to hear people 's experiences of how they ended up on a homeless register .
quality of lives mr puzey said the panel members would come from industry , the media , the church and education .
he said : " the commissioners will each bring particular skills and experience in their field , which i hope will help them draw up some innovative ideas on how we can tackle homelessness . "
last month the charity 's christmas campaign estimated 240 families with children would be housed in bed and breakfast accommodation because local authorities could not find suitable alternatives .
john puzey is putting together shelter cymru 's ' commission ' " there 's plenty of evidence that accommodation of this type has a real effect on the quality of children 's lives , " said mr puzey .
" they are something like four times more likely to end up in an accident and emergency department , perhaps because they have been scalded by kettles that have to been put on the floor because there is no kitchen .
" the experience of bed and breakfast accommodation on families with children is that those children are more likely to end up homeless themselves . "
the charity said more than 8,000 children were members of homeless families in wales last year and more than 20,000 children lived in poor housing or overcrowded conditions .
he said : " poor housing , homeless and overcrowding have a devastating effect on children 's lives affecting their health , education and life chances .

the development spanning 40 miles from east and south-east london to kent and essex aims to attract people on a range of incomes to create mixed communities .
but findings by the institute for public policy research show priorities varied dramatically between groups .
current thinking is to build 120,000 new homes in the area by 2016 .
transport connections this would also include new schools , sports facilities , businesses , health centres , parks , and transport links , in an attempt to meet the south 's long-term housing needs .
but jim bennett , author of the report , said : " although people want to be able to live in housing which is affordable , they certainly do n't want to live in something called " affordable housing " .
higher income groups want fast transport connections with central london and places with a cultural heritage , he said .
he added that people wanted schools and surgeries within walking distance and good transport links , but attracting a social mix of people remained a big challenge because of negative perceptions .
it is not the first time the multi-million development , said to be western europe 's biggest regeneration scheme , has come under fire .
concerns over the quality of housing planned , investment pledged , urban sprawl and the risk of flooding have already been voiced .

the development spanning 40 miles from east and south-east london to kent and essex aims to attract people on a range of incomes to create mixed communities .
but findings by the institute for public policy research show priorities varied dramatically between groups .
current thinking is to build 120,000 new homes in the area by 2016 .
transport connections this would also include new schools , sports facilities , businesses , health centres , parks , and transport links , in an attempt to meet the south 's long-term housing needs .
but jim bennett , author of the report , said : " although people want to be able to live in housing which is affordable , they certainly do n't want to live in something called " affordable housing " .
higher income groups want fast transport connections with central london and places with a cultural heritage , he said .
he added that people wanted schools and surgeries within walking distance and good transport links , but attracting a social mix of people remained a big challenge because of negative perceptions .
it is not the first time the multi-million development , said to be western europe 's biggest regeneration scheme , has come under fire .
concerns over the quality of housing planned , investment pledged , urban sprawl and the risk of flooding have already been voiced .

the loudspeakers are being used to tell people they can not smoke anywhere on the queen 's medical centre -lrb- qmc -rrb- site .
anyone wanting to light up has to go to the gates of the hospital grounds on derby road regardless of their medical condition , officials said .
managers have taken the step ahead of new legislation to make the whole of the nhs smoke free by january 2007 .
smoke free phil walmsley , assistant director of nursing at the qmc said : " we have increased security staff for the first couple of weeks so they can get around and ask people to stop smoking .
" it is a difficult phase because obviously it is a new policy and it wo n't be popular with a small group of people , particularly smokers .
" it would be nice to think people would automatically recognise that in a hospital environment smoking is not really seen as permissible - we all recognise the dangers of passive smoking . "
patients told bbc news they found the situation confusing , as some patients and visitors were being asked to move on if they were smoking but others were not .
ashtrays are also still in place at the hospital 's entrance .
one patient who smoked said : " i do n't see why we should walk up derby road when there 's people smoking and they 're not moving them on .
" i think it 's rubbish as long as you 're not smoking in the main entrance there - i mean it does waft in the building . "
the ban was introduced on 1 january .
