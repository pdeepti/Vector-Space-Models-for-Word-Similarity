in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

" the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city . " the bode museum opens to the general public on thursday . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city . " the bode museum opens to the general public on thursday . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism . " wolfgang bosbach from the cdu rejected the idea of a summit , saying he believed that solution was a combination of stringent sentencing and political education . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin culture -pipe- 17.10.2006 after expensive facelift , berlin reopens kaiser-era museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is lit up at night the latest addition to berlin 's cultural landscape , the bode museum , is to reopen its doors after a six-year makeover .
the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.10.2006 corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colleges are discovering the benefits of corporate sponsorship for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .
for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

" the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.10.2006 corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colleges are discovering the benefits of corporate sponsorship for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .
for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

us investigators claimed he was an islamist " enemy combatant " with links to al qaeda . in 2001 , german authorities launched their own investigation to probe whether kurnaz was a member of a terrorist group , a crime that carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years . kurnaz has insisted throughout that he was innocent .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

the figures were compiled from corporate accounts published in annual reports . ackermann still on top deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann was again the highest-paid german ceo , grossing 8.4 million euros in basic salary alone last year , up from 6.2 million euros in 2004 . in second and third places were the chief executives of daimlerchrysler , with 5.2 million euros and sap , with 4.7 million euros , dsw estimated . the ceos of airline lufthansa and postbank , wolfgang mayrhuber and wulf von schimmelmann were among the " lowest " paid , pocketing 1.3 million euros and 1.8 million euros respectively . reluctant to divulge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann is still the highest paid boss meanwhile , a number of top german companies are still reluctant to publish the salaries of their chief executives and board members , even though they will be legally obliged to do so from next year , the study showed . car makers such as daimlerchrysler and bmw or reinsurance giant munich re have yet to publish a detailed breakdown of the salaries paid to their chief executives . as many as seven of the 30 companies listed in the blue-chip dax index have not published the individual salaries of their board members , hocker said . in addition to daimlerchryler , bmw and munich re , detergents maker henkel , chemicals giant basf , health care group fresenius medical care and industrial conglomerate linde refused to publish their executives ' salaries . but under a law passed by the previous government of former chancellor gerhard schröder , companies listed in germany will be obliged to publish such information from next year . only if 75 percent of shareholders at a company 's annual meeting vote against publication can an exemption be made . but for those companies that do publish , a comparison is still difficult because there are as yet no standard rules as to what must be included in salaries , particularly with regard to share option schemes and other performance-related bonuses , according to dsw . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens outrages politicians with executive pay hikes siemens ' plan to raise executives ' pay has led to indignation among german politicians and analysts as the company prepares to begin collective negotiations with trade unions .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism . " wolfgang bosbach from the cdu rejected the idea of a summit , saying he believed that solution was a combination of stringent sentencing and political education . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles to explain far-right election success politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.10.2006 study : european energy usage pushes the limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shortages could become more common in europe europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .
energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.10.2006 corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colleges are discovering the benefits of corporate sponsorship for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .
for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.10.2006 corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colleges are discovering the benefits of corporate sponsorship for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .
for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.10.2006 germany 's far-right rolls up its sleeves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real and present danger the federal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- has revealed that the far-right threat is a very real one , with the number of violent offenses committed by neo-nazis climbing steeply . neo-nazi brutality is rarely out of germany 's newspapers . in january , a 12-year-old boy with an ethiopian father was beaten and humiliated by a gang of four far-right youths in a small town in eastern germany .
in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .

in april , a german man of east-african origin was left fighting for his life after being attacked in potsdam .
in the run-up to the world cup , a former government spokesman felt compelled to warn visitors to avoid certain areas or " they might not make it out alive . " is the country witnessing a revival of xenophobic violence and racism , or are these incidents blown out of proportion by a media all too aware that headlines about nazis sell newspapers ? while many dismiss the regular reports of xenophobic violence as scare-mongering , statistics revealed by the german interior ministry this week prove that the far-right 's gloves are indeed off . statistics that speak for themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was beaten up in potsdam between january and august , some 8,000 offenses perpetrated by right-wing radicals were reported to the bka - 20 percent more than the previous year and 50 percent more than in 2004 . while the number of incidents is increasing , the degree of violence is also swelling .
in 2006 , 325 people had been injured by far-right violence by august , compared to 302 in 2005 . the issue has been catapulted back into public consciousness after the success of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in regional elections in september . appearing one day after round table discussions focused on the npd 's encroaching influence were held in berlin , the figures published by the daily newspaper tagesspiegel unleashed a wave of calls for the government to clamp down on the country 's far-right movement . the specter of the third reich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch compared the situation today to hitler 's germany " anyone who still talks in terms of unfortunate one-off incidents is failing to grasp a danger facing the whole of society , " said charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews .
" the aggression has become reminiscent of 1933 . " she also accused both politicians and society of deliberately neglecting the spiraling anti-semitism and right-wing radicalism of recent years despite warnings , saying that these attributes were " firmly anchored in certain sections of the population . " meanwhile , sebastian edathy of the junior coalition partner spd suggested what he called a " democracy summit , " which would bring together representatives from political parties , religious communities , unions and grass-roots associations to flesh out a strategy to tackle right-wing extremism . petra pau , head of the left party 's parliamentary group , proposed the government introduce " an independent watchdog to monitor right-wing extremism .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.10.2006 corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colleges are discovering the benefits of corporate sponsorship for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .
for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.10.2006 corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german colleges are discovering the benefits of corporate sponsorship for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .
for the firms , it means enhancing their profile among potential job seekers . up until now the bland , concrete lecture hall at the würzburg-schweinfurt university of applied sciences in bavaria , had a purely functional name : " z-o9 . "
the winter semester has just begun , and the room will soon get a facelift and a new name , courtesy of aldi süd , the ubiquitous discount supermarket chain , whose familiar geometric logo in southern germany is royal blue , turquoise and bright orange . the door to " z-09 " will be painted orange , and one wall in the lecture hall , which has a seating capacity for 290 engineering and business students , will bear an enlarged corporate logo in blue and white stripes against a silver-grey background .
the only other visible sign of the technical university 's sponsor will be a small plaque at the entrance that says " aldi süd . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small , discreet plaque with the aldi logo will be displayed at the entrance " they wanted it to be totally discreet , " said katja klein , a spokeswoman for the college .
not surprisingly , even klein has no idea how much aldi paid for the privilege of having its name branded in the halls of academia .
even the renovation costs remain a closely guarded secret . the owners of aldi , brothers karl and theo albrecht , who have carved up the supermarket empire between them along a north / south divide in germany , are known for being reclusive , publicity shy billionaires . this week the brothers topped manager magazin 's list of germany 's wealthiest individuals , with a net worth of 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- apiece .
corporate sponsorships new to germany " aldi has been involved with the college for years , and the idea to sponsor the lecture hall was theirs , " was all that klein could say . the bavarian state ministry sees no conflict in corporate sponsorships for schools and universities .
" we welcome business involvement in the educational sphere .
companies benefit from academic research , and the colleges gain a practical business perspective , " said a press release . " state financed trade schools and vocational colleges have complete autonomy in seeking private sources of funding .
there is no government oversight , as long as private companies do n't advertise their wares .
but they know their limits , " said markus gnad , a spokesman for bavaria 's ministry for science , research and the arts . although corporate sponsors and private patrons for the arts and education are common practice in the united states , with donations that can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars , the trend is relatively new to germany , and so far , with few , if any strings attached . win-win situation in march this year , lecture hall d-001 at the georg simon ohm fachhochschule , a technical university in nuremberg , was renamed the staedtler hall after the locally based staedtler mars gmbh , a leading manufacturer of writing instruments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staedtler , a nuremberg manufacturer of writing instruments sponsored a lecture hall at a local college " they were our first sponsor ever .
now we have two more .
there 's only a small plaque at the entrance with the company name , nothing more , " said elke zapf , spokeswoman for the school , who declined to disclose the amount the sponsors paid for the right to hang their shingle at the door . the school is state supported , with the private funds earmarked for general educational purposes decided on by the college , not the sponsor , said zapf , who added that the exposure for the company enhances their profile among potential job seekers . at würzburg-schweinfurt , which also has a second sponsor for another lecture hall , the sparkasse mainfranken savings bank , the proceeds from the sponsorships will go towards modernizing and upgrading the school 's facilities . " for the companies and the school , it is a win-win situation .
with increasing international and domestic competition among companies to recruit the best graduates , it pays for the companies to increase their profile .
our long term goal is to attract even more firms for such lecture hall sponsorships , " said klein . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

this would include preventing offenders released from jail from owning a car . wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , has called for new restrictions on the rehabilitation of sex offenders who have served their sentences . given that cars help most sex offenders identify , reach and get away from their victims , the new law would bar convicted sex offenders from owning a vehicle . " vehicles play a major role in the crime , " bosbach told reporters , according to reuters news service .
" by banning offenders from owning one , we can make it considerably harder for them to re-offend . " if they are going to be released from jail , then we need to set the bar as high as possible in order to reduce their threat level and prevent repeat crimes , " he said , adding that a legal framework needs to be put in place as soon as possible . controversial move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ban would infringe professional freedom but this might prove tricky . " in principle we would welcome any new initiative which would improve victim protection , " said veit schiemann from the weisser ring association for crime victims . " but any change to legislation needs to be thoroughly looked into from both a political and a legal point of view , and bosbach 's proposal would have far-reaching repercussions , " schiemann added .
" it might be in breach of an offender 's right to choose a job - were he barred from owning a car he would inevitably be barred from work in certain professions , which would be unconstitutional . " further initiatives would include closer monitoring of offenders upon their release from jail , while calls to post the names of convicted offenders in an internet registry were rejected by bosbach on the grounds the move could have " irrational consequences .

energy conservation and investments in alternatives are urgent , the authors concluded . will the lights go out soon ?
the authors of a new study on the european energy market believe so - and that bottlenecks in the delivery of energy in europe can be expected in the near future . entitled " european energy markets observatory , " the annual study by capgemini , a business and it consultancy headquartered in france , said that the capacity limits of generators averaged at only about 4.8 percent higher than usage at peak times .
that was a drop of a percentage point over 2004 and the lowest level in at least 10 years . though the high usage wo n't likely mean far-reaching power failures , such as occurred in the united states three years ago , the situation in some countries has become critical , the study 's authors said .
during the extremely hot summer in spain last year and the resulting surge in the use of air conditioners , for example , energy use and its price rose to record levels .
a cold wave in europe in november 2005 also pushed up usage while five atomic energy plants in france and two in germany were out of commission , the report said . in some countries , such as slovenia , consumers are already dealing with falling capacity .
there , the excess capacity available is far lower than 5 percent , said philippe coquet of capgemini . " in germany , the excess capacity is around 6 percent and is at a relatively safe level , " he said . more investment please the report 's authors said that plans to reduce energy consumption by around 20 percent by the year 2020 , as proposed by the eu in march , will be helpful but must begin earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new sources of energy and new plants are urgently needed " investments in new plants and the delivery network are especially urgent , " said coquet .
he estimated that about 700 billion euros -lrb- $ 950 billion -rrb- need to be put toward the effort over the next 25 years , with about 150 euros earmarked for the building of new energy plants in the next five years . the european energy market is expected to be a priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
whether that will mean progress in the discussion over the further liberalization of the energy market , more competition or cross-border cooperation on production and emissions is not yet clear . heatwave and bottlenecks but there are few united voices in germany , with politicians giving mixed signals . energy policies are currently " absolute chaos , " according to claudia kemfert , who heads the energy research department at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
as a result , energy companies feel insecure and put off long-term investments in new power plants , she said .
without the security to plan for the future , the competition could become even more intense due to the pressure on prices , kemfert added . but the energy companies would be unlikely be suffer much since high oil prices and production close to capacity limits meant that electricity prices - and profits - had risen sharply . " it 's in the concerns ' interests to keep capacities limits relatively low , " said kemfert that means that even a small increase in demand would likely lead to power shortages in the future .

the museum 's domed building , which juts out into the spree river , is a work of art in itself . when on oct .
18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day . " after 67 years , after the years of war , evacuation , destruction and the long years of division , we can finally display the richness of our treasures , " said lehmann . collections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reliquary , german , from around 1300 while the museum 's collections may be less spectacular than the neighboring pergamon museum , with its greek and babylonian star attractions , the bode does contain important collections of christian art , including one of the world 's best collections of coptic art . the museum 's sculpture collection comprises some 1,700 pieces , dating from the early medieval period to the end of the 18th century .
according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .
but a host of new technological features have also been added , such as ultraviolet filters to screen out the damaging effects of the sun 's rays and computer touch-screen terminals that provide detailed information on the collection and indicate how to navigate the museum . nameplates besides the artworks include english translations of the works ' titles , although other information is only in german . part of museum island " master plan " the museum was damaged in world war ii and , after the war , was located in the communist sector .
the east berlin government considered demolishing the building at one time .
although some repairs were made over the years , this is the first major modernization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is directly on the spree river the restoration is part of the overall revamp of berlin 's museum island complex - named a world heritage site by unesco - estimated to cost 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- .
the first step was the renovation of the alte nationalgalerie in 2001 .
the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .
the altes museum and neues museum will also be refurbished and the project will climax with the renovation of the pergamon , with its one-of-a-kind collection of greek and babylonian structures . some have criticized the fact that so much money is being poured into berlin 's museums while other collections around the country are struggling for funding .
but germany 's culture minister has defended the decision to invest heavily in culture for the capital . " the support of the cultural representation of berlin is and will remain one of the most important missions of federal cultural policy , " he said in a statement .
" this support is more than a recognition of tradition and history , it is a commitment to germany as a nation of culture and to the global cultural heritage of the museum island in the heart of the -lrb- capital -rrb- city .

18 , 102 years ago , emperor wilhelm ii officially opened the bode museum - then called the kaiser friedrich museum - it was a grey , rainy day in berlin . " the color on that day came from the uniforms , cassocks and medals , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian culture foundation . on tuesday , however , when journalists were invited into the freshly refurbished neoclassical structure on the tip of berlin 's famous museum island , sunshine poured through the building 's windows and skylights - perfect illumination for the painstaking , 162-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- renovation that has created a new home for berlin 's sculpture collection , along with treasures of the byzantine era and coins from antiquity to the present day .

according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .

according to the bode 's chief sculpture restorer , bodo buczynski , the museum has one of the best collections of 16th - 18th century italian sculpture north of the alps . the museum 's byzantine era -lrb- 330 - 1453 ce -rrb- collection , the only of its kind in germany , has some 300 objects which originate largely from constantinople -lrb- present-day istanbul -rrb- as well as egypt , russia , greece and the balkans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode 's coin collection the numismatics collection has a total of 500,000 objects , recording a history of coinage from the 6th century bce to the common european currency , the euro , of the 21st century .
some 4,000 coins and medals will be on display . " palace " on the island while the museum island 's other treasure houses are designed to look like greek temples , the bode museum is neoclassical , with two dramatic cupolas , looking more like a prussian palace than a home for art .
that came in for some criticism at its first opening . entering the museum , one is indeed struck by its grandeur , which evokes an era of emperors and kings with its huge statue of emperor friedrich i on horseback under a large cupola and amid marble columns and grand , sweeping staircases . bildunterschrift : founding curator wilhelm von bode , after whom the museum was renamed in 1956 , designed a series of " period rooms , " which were conceived to show the artwork from different eras in their contexts .
today 's curators have stayed with that idea , although they have pared down the presentation , made it less decorative and " given the sculptures a chance to breathe , " according to lehmann . with the exhibition rooms ' high ceilings , more modest ornamentation , simplified layout , and skylights and windows -lrb- some of which look out onto the spree river -rrb- , the curators have succeeded in giving the visitor a sense of space and calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists look at paintings as they walk in the museum 's gobelin hall many of the museum 's original features have been left intact , including wall fountains , moldings and reliefs .

the bode is the second museum on the island to get a new lease on life .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- japan agrees to halve tuna quota bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 17 october 2006 , 04:49 gmt 05:49 uk japan agrees to halve tuna quota by chris hogg bbc news , tokyo environmentalists have welcomed a rare admission from japan that its fishing vessels have exceeded quotas .
the country has also agreed to halve its annual catch of the popular southern blue-fin tuna .
japan imports about 10,000 tonnes of the fish , which is popular for use in sushi or sashimi dishes .
despite welcoming the news from tokyo , scientists say stocks of the fish are shrinking rapidly , and more still needs to be done .
prized delicacy the fatty parts of the tuna fish are known as " toro " in japan .
they are popular with japanese diners and command a high price on the open market .
the southern blue-fin tuna have more fatty parts than other species , which is why they are highly prized .
for years japan has been accused of breaking international agreements and catching more of the species than it was supposed to .
now it has acknowledged that its fleet has over-fished , catching a third more of the tuna than it was meant to last year .
it has agreed to cut its quota by 50 % for the next five years as a result .
but the environmental group wwf fears that will still not be enough to give the southern blue-fin tuna a chance to recover .
the fund welcomed japan 's decision to accept a reduction in its quota , part of an overall cut of around 20 % in the allowed catch in this part of the world .
but it said other countries should have agreed greater cuts in their quotas , in particular australia , where the quota remains intact .

the agreement will also make bbc wales programmes available on s4c 's broadband and on-demand services .

it has supplied programmes like the soap pobol y cwm ever since the channel was launched in 1982 , and also makes the news programme newyddion .

bbc chairman michael grade said : " we are delighted that this new partnership will strengthen and extend the bbc 's contribution .
i 'm certain welsh-language audiences will reap the benefits . "
s4c chairman john walter jones said : " the new partnership provides a welcome new chapter in the relationship between s4c and the bbc .

the men and women were held at the nuclear base on monday morning .
a scottish protester is also thought to have been arrested at the base on the clyde .
all the protesters were aged between 18 and 38 .
a group spokesman said they were held at a police station overnight and plan to travel home later this week .
faslane is home to the uk 's trident nuclear weapons system and has seen frequent protests by anti-nuclear campaigners .
we believe that nuclear weapons should not be on this earth as they are a threat to humanity martin smedjeback the protesters - 23 from sweden and 19 from finland - had travelled to scotland from their respective countries late last week and arrived at faslane at about 0400 bst on monday .
several members of the protest group sat down on the road in front of the gates , some chained together , while others erected a large tripod to act as an obstruction .
group spokesman martin smedjeback , 33 , from stockholm in sweden , said the protesters were due to be released on tuesday .
mr smedjeback added that his group felt compelled to travel to faslane as the nuclear weapons at the base were the closest to sweden and finland .
" we believe that nuclear weapons should not be on this earth as they are a threat to humanity , " he said .
" that goes for all nuclear weapons , and these ones here are the closest to us . "

at the awards ceremony , the founder of london-based children 's charity kids company , who has become known as the " angel of peckham " for her work , spoke about her story .
at the tender age of nine , camila batmanghelidjh made the decision to dedicate her life to helping children less fortunate than herself .
at the time her own home life and that of the 11,000 troubled boys and girls across the uk who now benefit from her unique blend of psychotherapy , practical assistance and unwavering emotional support could not have been further apart .
far from being neglected herself , camila spent much of her formative years being chauffeur driven between her palatial home and her father 's luxury resort-hotel by police bodyguards .
my brother and i used to lie on our stomachs down the staircase and see all these people with their amazing crowns and jewels come and go born in 1963 in tehran to a " very wealthy " iranian entrepreneur and his belgian wife , camila grew up in an " unbelievably sheltered environment " .
" i had one of the most privileged childhoods , " she says .
" my father owned a massive hotel with ice-skating rinks and swimming pools .
i never went into a shop .
" every night there would be these amazing parties at our house and my brother and i used to lie on our stomachs down the staircase and see all these people with their amazing crowns and jewels come and go , and the waiters run around in their black outfits . "
it was in the midst of this affluence that camila first became aware of a " powerful drive " to care for less privileged children , which she describes as a " gift " .
" it was very powerful , fully formed and i have ended up living it , " she says .
i was left with no money and no status at the age of 12 , camila was sent to the uk to be privately educated .
but after just two years at sherborne school for girls , in dorset , her own childhood suddenly turned as turbulent as that of many of the troubled teenagers who today turn up on the doorstep of her charity , kids company .
with iran in the grip of an islamic revolution , her father was arrested and all his assets seized .
fearing he would be executed , camila 's older sister , who was studying at manchester university , killed herself .
i wanted to set up a structure where the children could ask for help directly camila has never been able to return home .
all her childhood possessions were burned by iran 's revolutionary guards .
her " entire personal history was wiped out " , she says .
" it was terrifying .
my life changed dramatically .
and i was left with no money and no status . "
camila 's teachers helped her to apply for political asylum and the manager of the british bank where her father had an overseas account agreed to cover her outstanding school fees .
but she had to take a job to cover her living expenses .
driven by the powerful " gift " she had first become aware of as a nine-year-old girl living in the lap of luxury , she chose to work as a nursery nurse and has worked with children ever since .
she went on to study psychotherapy and was soon counselling children referred to her by local authorities .
but camila rapidly became frustrated by the number of her clients who failed to attend more than a few therapy sessions .
" i very quickly realised the system was flawed because it assumed there was always a responsible adult to take the children to sessions , " she says .
" i wanted to set up a structure where the children could ask for help directly ... to develop something that would meet these children 's needs where they were . "
determined to realise her vision , camila , at the age of 25 , stopped her mortgage repayments to finance the foundation of her own charity , the place2be , which today provides therapy for 20,000 children every year in schools throughout the country .
taken to court by her building society , she was only saved from having her flat repossessed by a sympathetic judge .
the same two-bedroom £ 70,000 north london flat has since been re-mortgaged twice to help finance camila 's second charity , kids company .
i had to decide whether i was going to deliver this level of emotional commitment to my own children or other children these days most of camila 's time is taken up by fundraising .
she has raised more than £ 20m for kids company and won the 2006 woman of the year award , from the women of the year lunch and assembly - a charity which was created in 1955 to celebrate the achievements of women .
she was also named ernst & young 's social entrepreneur of the year in 2005 .
" i come from a very wealthy entrepreneurial background , " she says .
" i was around entrepreneurs all of my childhood and if i was interested in business i would make a lot of money - but i just want to work with the children . "
the drive that helped camila cope with her own turbulent childhood has since benefited thousands of children from much less privileged backgrounds .
but she says it has also cost her the chance to have children of her own .
" i had to decide whether i was going to deliver this level of emotional commitment to my own children or other children - i was very clear i would not be able to do both , " she says .
camila works 12 hours a day , seven days a week at the kids company centre in peckham , london , and has not taken a holiday for 11 years .
it was set up in 1996 and offers emotional , practical and educational support to vulnerable young people whose carers are often unable to provide for them .
" i have not forgotten what it feels like to be child , " camila says .
" i have an intense memory of being a child , so i have a real ability to see the world from the perspective of a child and meet their needs . "

" i very quickly realised the system was flawed because it assumed there was always a responsible adult to take the children to sessions , " she says .
" i wanted to set up a structure where the children could ask for help directly ... to develop something that would meet these children 's needs where they were . "
determined to realise her vision , camila , at the age of 25 , stopped her mortgage repayments to finance the foundation of her own charity , the place2be , which today provides therapy for 20,000 children every year in schools throughout the country .
taken to court by her building society , she was only saved from having her flat repossessed by a sympathetic judge .
the same two-bedroom £ 70,000 north london flat has since been re-mortgaged twice to help finance camila 's second charity , kids company .
i had to decide whether i was going to deliver this level of emotional commitment to my own children or other children these days most of camila 's time is taken up by fundraising .
she has raised more than £ 20m for kids company and won the 2006 woman of the year award , from the women of the year lunch and assembly - a charity which was created in 1955 to celebrate the achievements of women .
she was also named ernst & young 's social entrepreneur of the year in 2005 .
" i come from a very wealthy entrepreneurial background , " she says .
" i was around entrepreneurs all of my childhood and if i was interested in business i would make a lot of money - but i just want to work with the children . "
the drive that helped camila cope with her own turbulent childhood has since benefited thousands of children from much less privileged backgrounds .
but she says it has also cost her the chance to have children of her own .
" i had to decide whether i was going to deliver this level of emotional commitment to my own children or other children - i was very clear i would not be able to do both , " she says .
camila works 12 hours a day , seven days a week at the kids company centre in peckham , london , and has not taken a holiday for 11 years .
it was set up in 1996 and offers emotional , practical and educational support to vulnerable young people whose carers are often unable to provide for them .
" i have not forgotten what it feels like to be child , " camila says .
" i have an intense memory of being a child , so i have a real ability to see the world from the perspective of a child and meet their needs . "

at the awards ceremony , the founder of london-based children 's charity kids company , who has become known as the " angel of peckham " for her work , spoke about her story .
at the tender age of nine , camila batmanghelidjh made the decision to dedicate her life to helping children less fortunate than herself .
at the time her own home life and that of the 11,000 troubled boys and girls across the uk who now benefit from her unique blend of psychotherapy , practical assistance and unwavering emotional support could not have been further apart .
far from being neglected herself , camila spent much of her formative years being chauffeur driven between her palatial home and her father 's luxury resort-hotel by police bodyguards .
my brother and i used to lie on our stomachs down the staircase and see all these people with their amazing crowns and jewels come and go born in 1963 in tehran to a " very wealthy " iranian entrepreneur and his belgian wife , camila grew up in an " unbelievably sheltered environment " .
" i had one of the most privileged childhoods , " she says .
" my father owned a massive hotel with ice-skating rinks and swimming pools .
i never went into a shop .
" every night there would be these amazing parties at our house and my brother and i used to lie on our stomachs down the staircase and see all these people with their amazing crowns and jewels come and go , and the waiters run around in their black outfits . "
it was in the midst of this affluence that camila first became aware of a " powerful drive " to care for less privileged children , which she describes as a " gift " .
" it was very powerful , fully formed and i have ended up living it , " she says .
i was left with no money and no status at the age of 12 , camila was sent to the uk to be privately educated .
but after just two years at sherborne school for girls , in dorset , her own childhood suddenly turned as turbulent as that of many of the troubled teenagers who today turn up on the doorstep of her charity , kids company .
with iran in the grip of an islamic revolution , her father was arrested and all his assets seized .
fearing he would be executed , camila 's older sister , who was studying at manchester university , killed herself .
i wanted to set up a structure where the children could ask for help directly camila has never been able to return home .
all her childhood possessions were burned by iran 's revolutionary guards .
her " entire personal history was wiped out " , she says .
" it was terrifying .
my life changed dramatically .
and i was left with no money and no status . "
camila 's teachers helped her to apply for political asylum and the manager of the british bank where her father had an overseas account agreed to cover her outstanding school fees .
but she had to take a job to cover her living expenses .
driven by the powerful " gift " she had first become aware of as a nine-year-old girl living in the lap of luxury , she chose to work as a nursery nurse and has worked with children ever since .
she went on to study psychotherapy and was soon counselling children referred to her by local authorities .

at the awards ceremony , the founder of london-based children 's charity kids company , who has become known as the " angel of peckham " for her work , spoke about her story .
at the tender age of nine , camila batmanghelidjh made the decision to dedicate her life to helping children less fortunate than herself .
at the time her own home life and that of the 11,000 troubled boys and girls across the uk who now benefit from her unique blend of psychotherapy , practical assistance and unwavering emotional support could not have been further apart .
far from being neglected herself , camila spent much of her formative years being chauffeur driven between her palatial home and her father 's luxury resort-hotel by police bodyguards .
my brother and i used to lie on our stomachs down the staircase and see all these people with their amazing crowns and jewels come and go born in 1963 in tehran to a " very wealthy " iranian entrepreneur and his belgian wife , camila grew up in an " unbelievably sheltered environment " .
" i had one of the most privileged childhoods , " she says .
" my father owned a massive hotel with ice-skating rinks and swimming pools .
i never went into a shop .
" every night there would be these amazing parties at our house and my brother and i used to lie on our stomachs down the staircase and see all these people with their amazing crowns and jewels come and go , and the waiters run around in their black outfits . "
it was in the midst of this affluence that camila first became aware of a " powerful drive " to care for less privileged children , which she describes as a " gift " .
" it was very powerful , fully formed and i have ended up living it , " she says .
i was left with no money and no status at the age of 12 , camila was sent to the uk to be privately educated .
but after just two years at sherborne school for girls , in dorset , her own childhood suddenly turned as turbulent as that of many of the troubled teenagers who today turn up on the doorstep of her charity , kids company .
with iran in the grip of an islamic revolution , her father was arrested and all his assets seized .
fearing he would be executed , camila 's older sister , who was studying at manchester university , killed herself .
i wanted to set up a structure where the children could ask for help directly camila has never been able to return home .
all her childhood possessions were burned by iran 's revolutionary guards .
her " entire personal history was wiped out " , she says .
" it was terrifying .
my life changed dramatically .
and i was left with no money and no status . "
camila 's teachers helped her to apply for political asylum and the manager of the british bank where her father had an overseas account agreed to cover her outstanding school fees .
but she had to take a job to cover her living expenses .
driven by the powerful " gift " she had first become aware of as a nine-year-old girl living in the lap of luxury , she chose to work as a nursery nurse and has worked with children ever since .
she went on to study psychotherapy and was soon counselling children referred to her by local authorities .
but camila rapidly became frustrated by the number of her clients who failed to attend more than a few therapy sessions .
" i very quickly realised the system was flawed because it assumed there was always a responsible adult to take the children to sessions , " she says .
" i wanted to set up a structure where the children could ask for help directly ... to develop something that would meet these children 's needs where they were . "
determined to realise her vision , camila , at the age of 25 , stopped her mortgage repayments to finance the foundation of her own charity , the place2be , which today provides therapy for 20,000 children every year in schools throughout the country .
taken to court by her building society , she was only saved from having her flat repossessed by a sympathetic judge .
the same two-bedroom £ 70,000 north london flat has since been re-mortgaged twice to help finance camila 's second charity , kids company .
i had to decide whether i was going to deliver this level of emotional commitment to my own children or other children these days most of camila 's time is taken up by fundraising .
she has raised more than £ 20m for kids company and won the 2006 woman of the year award , from the women of the year lunch and assembly - a charity which was created in 1955 to celebrate the achievements of women .
she was also named ernst & young 's social entrepreneur of the year in 2005 .
" i come from a very wealthy entrepreneurial background , " she says .
" i was around entrepreneurs all of my childhood and if i was interested in business i would make a lot of money - but i just want to work with the children . "
the drive that helped camila cope with her own turbulent childhood has since benefited thousands of children from much less privileged backgrounds .
but she says it has also cost her the chance to have children of her own .
" i had to decide whether i was going to deliver this level of emotional commitment to my own children or other children - i was very clear i would not be able to do both , " she says .
camila works 12 hours a day , seven days a week at the kids company centre in peckham , london , and has not taken a holiday for 11 years .
it was set up in 1996 and offers emotional , practical and educational support to vulnerable young people whose carers are often unable to provide for them .
" i have not forgotten what it feels like to be child , " camila says .
" i have an intense memory of being a child , so i have a real ability to see the world from the perspective of a child and meet their needs . "

" it really took off last year , " says saudi journalist rasheed abou-alsamh .
there are now between 500 and 600 saudi blogs - in english as well as arabic - and the bloggers are women as well as men .
" i think young people see the internet as a way of expressing themselves easily and in an uncensored fashion , " says mr abou-alsamh .
the saudi kingdom is still in many ways a closed society .
" the media here are controlled , " says blogger fouad al-farhan , who is 31 and runs an it company in jeddah .
" we ca n't express our thoughts on tv or in newspapers or magazines . "
unusually , he includes his mobile phone number , as well as his full name , on his arabic blog -lrb- www.smartinfo.com.sa / fouad / -rrb- .
he uses the blog to comment on political and religious issues .
others call him a conservative - a term he dislikes .
his views are certainly very different from those of liberal young bloggers who attack the religious police - or discuss their love lives .
fictional love story one young woman blogs under the name mystique .
mystique 's blog " i am born - a man chooses my name , i am taught - to appreciate that he did not bury me alive , i learn - what he wants me to know , i marry - who he wants me to marry , i eat - what he wants me to eat , if he dies - another man controls my life a father , a brother , a husband , a son , a man " extract from poem : rantings of an arabian woman " i want to remain anonymous , " she says , adding that only a small group of friends know her real identity .
her english blog -lrb- www.mystiquesa.blogspot.com -rrb- is , by saudi standards , outspoken .
" i have this fictional series , a love story between a man and a woman .
and i get into the most intimate details of the relationship - like sexual details . "
not surprisingly in such a conservative society , she gets hate mail - as well as support from like-minded young saudis .
another anonymous woman blogger , saudi eve , had her site blocked after she had written freely about sex and religion .
global discussion there is a cyber-battle under way , says journalist rasheed abou-alsamh , between liberals and conservatives .
ahmed al-omran found his site -lrb- www.saudijeans.blogspot.com -rrb- blocked earlier this year .
he is a student in riyadh who blogs in english .
" most of the other bloggers supported me - even those who normally disagree with me , " he says .
his blog was soon back on-line .
" i started blogging over two years ago , " ahmed says .
" it has become an integral part of my life . "
outsiders , he says , tend to have a one-dimensional view of saudi arabia .
" i can have a discussion with the rest of the world , and we can show them how we live . "

" it really took off last year , " says saudi journalist rasheed abou-alsamh .
there are now between 500 and 600 saudi blogs - in english as well as arabic - and the bloggers are women as well as men .
" i think young people see the internet as a way of expressing themselves easily and in an uncensored fashion , " says mr abou-alsamh .
the saudi kingdom is still in many ways a closed society .
" the media here are controlled , " says blogger fouad al-farhan , who is 31 and runs an it company in jeddah .
" we ca n't express our thoughts on tv or in newspapers or magazines . "
unusually , he includes his mobile phone number , as well as his full name , on his arabic blog -lrb- www.smartinfo.com.sa / fouad / -rrb- .
he uses the blog to comment on political and religious issues .
others call him a conservative - a term he dislikes .
his views are certainly very different from those of liberal young bloggers who attack the religious police - or discuss their love lives .
fictional love story one young woman blogs under the name mystique .
mystique 's blog i am born - a man chooses my name , i am taught - to appreciate that he did not bury me alive , i learn - what he wants me to know , i marry - who he wants me to marry , i eat - what he wants me to eat , if he dies - another man controls my life a father , a brother , a husband , a son , a man extract from poem : rantings of an arabian woman " i want to remain anonymous , " she says , adding that only a small group of friends know her real identity .
her english blog -lrb- www.mystiquesa.blogspot.com -rrb- is , by saudi standards , outspoken .
" i have this fictional series , a love story between a man and a woman .
and i get into the most intimate details of the relationship - like sexual details . "
not surprisingly in such a conservative society , she gets hate mail - as well as support from like-minded young saudis .
another anonymous woman blogger , saudi eve , had her site blocked after she had written freely about sex and religion .
global discussion there is a cyber-battle under way , says journalist rasheed abou-alsamh , between liberals and conservatives .
ahmed al-omran found his site -lrb- www.saudijeans.blogspot.com -rrb- blocked earlier this year .
he is a student in riyadh who blogs in english .
" most of the other bloggers supported me - even those who normally disagree with me , " he says .
his blog was soon back on-line .
" i started blogging over two years ago , " ahmed says .
" it has become an integral part of my life . "
outsiders , he says , tend to have a one-dimensional view of saudi arabia .
" i can have a discussion with the rest of the world , and we can show them how we live . "

last month 's consumer prices index figure was 2.4 % , said the office for national statistics - a reduction from the 2.5 % seen in august .
prices are still rising faster than the government 's 2 % target , however , leading economists generally to expect a rise in interest rates in november .
the rpi rate , which includes mortgage payments , rose from 3.4 % to 3.6 % .
pensions increase the increase to the september rate of headline rpi is however good news for pensioners .
this is because the government uses the september rpi rate to determine increases to state pensions each april .
as a result , pensioners are set to receive their biggest increase since 1997 , more than £ 3 per week .
if the rise is given the go-ahead by parliament , the state pension for a single person will increase by £ 3.05 per week to £ 87.30 from next april .
' upward trajectory ' bank of england governor mervyn king warned earlier this month that september 's expected dip in inflation was likely to be only temporary .
the bank kept interest rates on hold at 4.75 % in both september and october , after raising them by one quarter of a percentage point in august .
analysts said that while petrol prices may have fallen , other costs were going up significantly .
" while we expect petrol price falls to continue in the next couple of months , the mammoth increase in university tuition fees and continued utility bill hikes will ensure inflation remains on an upward trajectory beyond september , " said alan clarke , economist at bnp paribas .

last month 's consumer prices index figure was 2.4 % , said the office for national statistics - a reduction from the 2.5 % seen in august .
prices are still rising faster than the government 's 2 % target , however , leading economists generally to expect a rise in interest rates in november .
the rpi rate , which includes mortgage payments , rose from 3.4 % to 3.6 % .
pensions increase the increase to the september rate of headline rpi is however good news for pensioners .
this is because the government uses the september rpi rate to determine increases to state pensions each april .
as a result , pensioners are set to receive their biggest increase since 1997 , more than £ 3 per week .
if the rise is given the go-ahead by parliament , the state pension for a single person will increase by £ 3.05 per week to £ 87.30 from next april .
' upward trajectory ' bank of england governor mervyn king warned earlier this month that september 's expected dip in inflation was likely to be only temporary .
the bank kept interest rates on hold at 4.75 % in both september and october , after raising them by one quarter of a percentage point in august .
analysts said that while petrol prices may have fallen , other costs were going up significantly .
" while we expect petrol price falls to continue in the next couple of months , the mammoth increase in university tuition fees and continued utility bill hikes will ensure inflation remains on an upward trajectory beyond september , " said alan clarke , economist at bnp paribas .

karen cross - school run mum karen cross drops off her 11-year-old daughter vicky at school daily , just 10 minutes ' drive from her home in solihull - and sometimes takes three-year-old nathan to nursery in the car .
she does not think it is an option for vicky to walk as it is too far and it is a very busy road .
however , she does give a lift to some of vicky 's classmates .
on road charging she says : " in some ways i do n't like the idea .
at the back of my mind i think it would be just another way of getting more money out of motorists .
" but on the other hand i do n't drive very far so it might benefit me if taxes are reduced for motorists who drive less . "
she adds that the privacy issue would also worry her : " it would concern me that it was an extension of big brother , with the authorities knowing exactly where you are and when " .
margaret walsh - the florist margaret walsh owns the emilie duclos florist in the staffordshire market town of uttoxeter .
she is worried that road charging could put her out of business : " i do love my work and i do love my shop .
but we are only a small business and any more pressure the government puts on us , then we wo n't be able to survive . "
neither is she in favour of weighting the charges to benefit people like herself who use country roads - at the expense of those who use busy roads in big cities at peak hours .
" i feel it would be unfair to anyone who has got a business in a big town or city .
a small business person already has to pay enough taxes .
you do n't realise until you start one . "
margaret estimates that she travels up to 200 miles a day throughout staffordshire and into derbyshire .
" you really clock up the miles , especially as people often only give you a vague address and in the country people only have house names not streets .
you can be driving round and around before you find a delivery address . "
nick waddington - the commuter nick waddington is a partner with knight frank chartered surveyors .
he recently moved his family out of london for the " good life " in worcestershire , so he already has experience of the congestion charge in the capital .
his daily commute by company car into birmingham takes an hour .
but it would take half an hour longer each way by public transport and would probably also involve taxi journeys to and from the station because of a lack of buses where he now lives .
he said : " i would definitely like the advantages of less congested journeys .
but i ca n't dictate when clients want me to look round their buildings so i ca n't plan my journeys to make them cheaper . "
he would be prepared to tolerate a slight invasion of his privacy in exchange for the benefits of quicker journeys and joked : " my wife might be glad to know where i am , too ! "
steve coape-arnold - white van man some people might not have a good word to say for " white van man " in general .
but steve coape-arnold appears to break the mould - with customers clamouring for him to deliver new kitchens or undertake home removals to anywhere in the uk .
he probably clocks up the highest and most unpredictable mileage of our four motorists , and he is concerned about the possible effects on his business of any charge on mileage .
" it 's quite a competitive business and although we would all be in the same boat , it would be just another thing to worry about , " he said .
" it would be nice to think that it would reduce traffic and i would get to places more easily , but i 'm not sure that will happen . "
the privacy issue also worries him .
he is prepared to tolerate this for the length of the experiment , but otherwise he does not like the idea of " constantly being watched " .

karen cross : school run mum she does not think it is an option for vicky to walk as it is too far and it is a very busy road .
however , she does give a lift to some of vicky 's classmates .
on road charging she says : " in some ways i do n't like the idea .
at the back of my mind i think it would be just another way of getting more money out of motorists .
" but on the other hand i do n't drive very far so it might benefit me if taxes are reduced for motorists who drive less . "

a bbc experiment intends to find out what it would be like .
meet our test drivers .
karen cross - school run mum karen cross drops off her 11-year-old daughter vicky at school daily , just 10 minutes ' drive from her home in solihull - and sometimes takes three-year-old nathan to nursery in the car .
karen cross : school run mum she does not think it is an option for vicky to walk as it is too far and it is a very busy road .
however , she does give a lift to some of vicky 's classmates .
on road charging she says : " in some ways i do n't like the idea .
at the back of my mind i think it would be just another way of getting more money out of motorists .
" but on the other hand i do n't drive very far so it might benefit me if taxes are reduced for motorists who drive less . "
she adds that the privacy issue would also worry her : " it would concern me that it was an extension of big brother , with the authorities knowing exactly where you are and when " .
margaret walsh - the florist margaret walsh owns the emilie duclos florist in the staffordshire market town of uttoxeter .
margaret walsh : the florist she is worried that road charging could put her out of business : " i do love my work and i do love my shop .
but we are only a small business and any more pressure the government puts on us , then we wo n't be able to survive . "
neither is she in favour of weighting the charges to benefit people like herself who use country roads - at the expense of those who use busy roads in big cities at peak hours .
" i feel it would be unfair to anyone who has got a business in a big town or city .
a small business person already has to pay enough taxes .
you do n't realise until you start one . "
margaret estimates that she travels up to 200 miles a day throughout staffordshire and into derbyshire .
" you really clock up the miles , especially as people often only give you a vague address and in the country people only have house names not streets .
