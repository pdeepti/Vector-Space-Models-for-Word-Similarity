former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .
that 's why the world cup actually offers germans a unique chance as hosts to work on their image - as long as nothing happens .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action . " several months are likely to be needed before the eu regulators decide to lodge formal charges against the companies targeted by the raids . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels could act against spain over takeover block spain could face punitive measures from the eu over its attempts to block the takeover of spanish energy company endesa by germany 's e.on.

his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go .
they might not make it out alive , " uwe-karsten heye told deutschlandradio kultur . heye was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government spokesman from 1998 to 2002 .
he now runs an anti-racist action group called gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- . his remarks provoked angry reactions .
in brandenburg , state premier matthias platzeck , a fellow social democrat , called the comments an " absurd slur of a whole region that is no way justifiable . "
brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said heye should resign from his position at gesicht zeigen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye while extremism and xenophobia should n't be minimized , said wolfgang bosback , a leading cdu parliamentarian , " you ca n't stamp broad areas of the new german states or of the state of brandenburg suspicious and at least indirectly declare them so-called no-go areas . "
he added that it would be " fatal " if comments such as heye 's would cause people not to come to the world cup .
no-go areas but heye also received backing from other quarters .
" the reality is that school classes with many migrant children ask whether it 's safe to go camping in brandenburg or mecklenburg-western pomerania , " said daniel-cohn bendit , green party leader in the european parliament . social democratic parliamentarian sebastian edathy said heye 's warning was fully comprehensible .
" here the message is not the messenger 's fault , " he said .
edathy , whose father comes from india , added that there were certain areas of berlin , such as the eastern treptow district , where he would n't take the train at night .
berlin political scientist yonas endrias , a member of the africa council , an umbrella organization of african community groups and activists in germany which plans to publish a guide to " no-go " areas for black visitors to germany , agreed , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are a problem in western germany as well " none of us blacks would take our families on an outing to brandenburg , " he told the neue presse newspaper .
" in western germany there 's also racism , but in an eastern german place you 're much more likely to be attacked as a black . " later in the day , heye said he had n't wanted to stigmatize brandenburg .
he pointed out that the africa council had already declared some parts of germany , including brandenburg , dangerous for black people . the state of brandenburg , which surrounds berlin , was the scene of a brutal attack on a 37-year-old man of ethiopian origin in april . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup guide highlights germany 's racist hotspots a guide to potential racial hot spots in germany will go live on the internet and be published in brochure form in time to warn visitors to the world cup of areas known for far-right extremism .

in its annual corruption report , transparency international estimates that corruption costs germany 's healthcare system between 8 and 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 and 30 billion -rrb- a year . in its latest yearbook , the german chapter of the non-profit , non-governmental organization working to counter corrupt international business and government practices warned against the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on doctors and researchers and called for tougher action against those who abuse the system . it alleged that the most serious aspect of corruption in the german health system is the influence exerted by the pharmaceuticals industry on the licensing , medical and therapeutic assessment and marketing of products .
ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .
" " we also have about 250 separate statutory insurance companies , while in other countries the health system is handled much more centrally .
it goes without saying that under such circumstances the power of the functionaries has got rather out of control . " pharmaceuticals-fixing according to transparency international , the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry is particularly critical . ti pharmacologist peter schönhofer says the industry has adapted its products to marketing possibilities and not the other way round : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much do doctors know ?
" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .
these included inviting doctors to further education seminars , which schönhofer dismissed as a means to advertise a company 's products . that 's not all .
" faking medical research has also become considerably more common , " added schönhofer . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between companies and clients need to be made public calling for more effective measures to combat corruption , transparency international said insurance companies , organizations of doctors who treat non-privately insured patients and medical associations should work more professionally . it also proposed treating leading functionaries in professional corporations as office-bearers who would face punishment in cases of corruption , making ties between sponsors and experts more transparent , and finally , introducing forgery-proof pharmaceutical packaging to curb illegal trading in medicines . brian pickering -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .
that 's why the world cup actually offers germans a unique chance as hosts to work on their image - as long as nothing happens .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .

" the da vinci code " might be one of the most talked-about films of the year , but the critics have crucified it . based on author dan brown 's 2003 thriller which has been translated into 44 languages and sold over 50 million copies , " the da vinci code " opened the cannes film festival wednesday amid the usual glitz , glamor and hype . but the movie about " the greatest conspiracy of the last 2000 years " looks set to be one of the greatest flops of 2006 . in it , a renowned harvard symbologist is summoned to the louvre museum in paris to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to da vinci 's artwork . when he breaks the code , he uncovers the key to one of the most baffling mysteries of all time and becomes a hunted man . hollywood expected it to be a guaranteed crowd-pleaser - but audiences in cannes begged to differ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the da vinci code " opened the cannes film festival despite the major buildup , expensive marketing campaign and a-list stars , the premiere ended up producing more snickers than gasps from the assembled journalists and movie critics .
the general public might have been a little more forgiving , but few reviewers had anything good to say about what 's been billed as the most eagerly-awaited movie of the year . controversy both the book and the film version of " the da vinci code " have been fuelled by controversy right from the start . as the film 's publicity engine gathered momentum in recent months , religious groups began calling for a ban , or at least a disclaimer explaining that the plot was purely fictional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the last supper " by leonardo da vinci many were insulted by the central concept , which revolves around the theory that the catholic church covered up the fact that jesus married mary magdalene , creating a lineage that still exists today . most of the criticism was n't even ideological .
others took offense simply because brown 's book is so , well , bad . " it 's a truly awful book riddled with mistakes , " said german publisher michael krüger .
" it 's neither a well-told story , interesting , nor anything at all . " confusing fact and fiction but after wednesday 's debacle , the churches at least are breathing a sigh of relief .
they 're confident that viewers wo n't confuse fact with fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has divided the critics " the jesus portrayed -lrb- in the movie -rrb- has nothing to do with the historical jesus , " said georg schöllgen , a professor of religious history in bonn , germany .
" the fictional one is sexually active , married , and pioneered women 's emancipation by making his wife a priest .
sure it 's fascinating , but it 's a bit too simplified . " experts have also argued that brown has n't checked his facts , especially regarding the relationship between jesus and mary magdalene .
" it 's complete fabrication , " said schöllgen .
" there is no mention of this at all in the new testament .
dan brown cites his source as the gospel of philip from the 2nd century ad , but even then the theory is unsubstantiated .
it 's definitely a stretch . " brown himself , meanwhile , has defended the novel and said the churches should be happy because after all , his book sparked a renewed interest in christian history and promoted spiritual discussion . winning formula the success of his book appeared to happen almost overnight , but in fact , brown worked hard to become one of time magazine 's most influential people in the world .
after aborting a career as a pop star , he turned his hand to writing , only to be turned down by publisher after publisher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan brown , one of the world 's most successful writers but with " the da vinci code , " he knew he was on to a winner .
with all the successful ingredients for a bestseller , it was a pot-boiler about secret societies steeped in controversy and conspiracy .
now that he 's found his formula , brown is working on a new novel set in washington .
his fans will be eager to see if he can do it again , but hollywood might not be so keen to see it turned into a film . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de church breaks silence on " da vinci code " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .

the general public might have been a little more forgiving , but few reviewers had anything good to say about what 's been billed as the most eagerly-awaited movie of the year . controversy both the book and the film version of " the da vinci code " have been fuelled by controversy right from the start . as the film 's publicity engine gathered momentum in recent months , religious groups began calling for a ban , or at least a disclaimer explaining that the plot was purely fictional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the last supper " by leonardo da vinci many were insulted by the central concept , which revolves around the theory that the catholic church covered up the fact that jesus married mary magdalene , creating a lineage that still exists today . most of the criticism was n't even ideological .
others took offense simply because brown 's book is so , well , bad . " it 's a truly awful book riddled with mistakes , " said german publisher michael krüger .
" it 's neither a well-told story , interesting , nor anything at all . " confusing fact and fiction but after wednesday 's debacle , the churches at least are breathing a sigh of relief .
they 're confident that viewers wo n't confuse fact with fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has divided the critics " the jesus portrayed -lrb- in the movie -rrb- has nothing to do with the historical jesus , " said georg schöllgen , a professor of religious history in bonn , germany .
" the fictional one is sexually active , married , and pioneered women 's emancipation by making his wife a priest .
sure it 's fascinating , but it 's a bit too simplified . " experts have also argued that brown has n't checked his facts , especially regarding the relationship between jesus and mary magdalene .
" it 's complete fabrication , " said schöllgen .
" there is no mention of this at all in the new testament .
dan brown cites his source as the gospel of philip from the 2nd century ad , but even then the theory is unsubstantiated .
it 's definitely a stretch . " brown himself , meanwhile , has defended the novel and said the churches should be happy because after all , his book sparked a renewed interest in christian history and promoted spiritual discussion . winning formula the success of his book appeared to happen almost overnight , but in fact , brown worked hard to become one of time magazine 's most influential people in the world .
after aborting a career as a pop star , he turned his hand to writing , only to be turned down by publisher after publisher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan brown , one of the world 's most successful writers but with " the da vinci code , " he knew he was on to a winner .
with all the successful ingredients for a bestseller , it was a pot-boiler about secret societies steeped in controversy and conspiracy .
now that he 's found his formula , brown is working on a new novel set in washington .
his fans will be eager to see if he can do it again , but hollywood might not be so keen to see it turned into a film . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de church breaks silence on " da vinci code " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?

ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .

" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .
these included inviting doctors to further education seminars , which schönhofer dismissed as a means to advertise a company 's products . that 's not all .
" faking medical research has also become considerably more common , " added schönhofer . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between companies and clients need to be made public calling for more effective measures to combat corruption , transparency international said insurance companies , organizations of doctors who treat non-privately insured patients and medical associations should work more professionally . it also proposed treating leading functionaries in professional corporations as office-bearers who would face punishment in cases of corruption , making ties between sponsors and experts more transparent , and finally , introducing forgery-proof pharmaceutical packaging to curb illegal trading in medicines . brian pickering -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .
the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- said the government was allowing deutsche telekom to establish a new monopoly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plays catch-up in the it world germany 's it branch is showing signs of recovery just as the government kicks off a year-long program focused on promoting information technology .

the struggle between pragmatists and fundamentalists is part of the party ’ s tradition , but will it tear them apart ? it could be described as a watershed event for the greens .
in frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , the party had signed what was for fundis - the party 's fundamental ideologists - a deal with the devil .
the greens now govern in frankfurt with the very party that used to represent the antithesis of their beliefs , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in the process , they resigned themselves to accepting projects that went against the grain of their traditional politics - the building of an autobahn tunnel and the expansion of frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has been a battleground for grassroots greens for decades the emotional debate during the greens ' frankfurt party caucus at the beginning of may , and the cool ending of it by the realos - the party 's pragmatic wing whose name comes from realpolitik - was just a microcosm of the greens ' ideological battle since its birth in 1980 .
eco-freaks against power-hungry " traitors . "
forests given up for economic goals .
it has been a balancing act that has generated ceaseless debates within the party .
still a protest party people usually associate the greens with the environment and the peace movement .
protests and demonstrations were once the order of the day .
yet gone are the times when tens of thousands gathered for anti-nuclear protests .
after all , germany has committed itself to closing down all its atomic power stations by 2021 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato air strikes on belgrade were reason enough to leave the party and war ?
the greens decided it can not be avoided sometimes when they supported nato air strikes against belgrade in 1999 .
indeed , that military operation left such a bitter aftertaste that strongly pacifistic green members , if they still are members , cringe when the subject is brought up .
" for fundis , the main issues are environment and the peace movement .
the green leadership had difficulty getting the point across that other issues , such as civil and human rights , or immigration play a major role in the party , " said hajo funke of the freie university in berlin .
nevertheless , the greens are a " protest " party , and remain so , according to funke .
it 's just that the protest touch is not as dominant as in the past .
one could say that the greens have exited the rebelliousness of political puberty and are entering young adulthood .
less glamor , more competence a look at the party 's web site reveals this clearly .
the top item is the poor chances for immigrant children in german schools , followed by the party 's position on germany 's intelligence service having spied on journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after joschka fischer 's departure , renate künast -lrb- r . -rrb- became a prominent party leader " the greens have an obvious voter base , one that is concerned about the environment .
but the party 's new co-chairwoman , renate künast , is very pragmatic , well-organized and has found new problems to concentrate on .
one part of the party 's profile is civil rights , " said funke .
furthermore , humanitarian missions , such as one that could send un troops to darfur , are acceptable as long as peace is the intention .
the topics are less glamorous , but funke believes the party leadership - even without its pr figure no. 1 , former foreign minister joschka fischer - is highly competent .
governing with the cdu deemed anti-social pragmatism is prevalent at all levels of the party .
coalitions solely with the social democrats as an option now appear hardly realistic .
daniel cohn-bendit , head of the greens in the european parliament , has said that governing with the conservative christian democrats offers " good political perspectives . "

" two factions are joining up that have very clear messages in frankfurt .
they are against the underprivileged , the poor and welfare recipients .
the greens handed the social welfare office to the cdu due to sheer incompetence , " ditfurth said .
for her , the greens have exhausted their effectiveness , no matter who they govern with .
when petra kelly founded what she called " the anti-party party , " ditfurth thought that a decade was the maximum it should remain in politics .

it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .

" the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .

in its annual corruption report , transparency international estimates that corruption costs germany 's healthcare system between 8 and 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 and 30 billion -rrb- a year . in its latest yearbook , the german chapter of the non-profit , non-governmental organization working to counter corrupt international business and government practices warned against the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on doctors and researchers and called for tougher action against those who abuse the system . it alleged that the most serious aspect of corruption in the german health system is the influence exerted by the pharmaceuticals industry on the licensing , medical and therapeutic assessment and marketing of products .
ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .
" " we also have about 250 separate statutory insurance companies , while in other countries the health system is handled much more centrally .
it goes without saying that under such circumstances the power of the functionaries has got rather out of control . " pharmaceuticals-fixing according to transparency international , the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry is particularly critical . ti pharmacologist peter schönhofer says the industry has adapted its products to marketing possibilities and not the other way round : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much do doctors know ?
" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .
these included inviting doctors to further education seminars , which schönhofer dismissed as a means to advertise a company 's products . that 's not all .
" faking medical research has also become considerably more common , " added schönhofer . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between companies and clients need to be made public calling for more effective measures to combat corruption , transparency international said insurance companies , organizations of doctors who treat non-privately insured patients and medical associations should work more professionally . it also proposed treating leading functionaries in professional corporations as office-bearers who would face punishment in cases of corruption , making ties between sponsors and experts more transparent , and finally , introducing forgery-proof pharmaceutical packaging to curb illegal trading in medicines . brian pickering -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go .
they might not make it out alive , " uwe-karsten heye told deutschlandradio kultur . heye was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government spokesman from 1998 to 2002 .
he now runs an anti-racist action group called gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- . his remarks provoked angry reactions .
in brandenburg , state premier matthias platzeck , a fellow social democrat , called the comments an " absurd slur of a whole region that is no way justifiable . "

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2006 it 's eurotrash all over again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly for disco queens : this year 's finnish entry is called ' hard rock hallelujah ' the 51st eurovision song contest opens in athens on thursday with 37 countries and more than 200 artists participating in a quintessentially european festival famed for elevating trash to the level of glamor . what is europe anyway ?
it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .
because eurovision is as whimsical and unpredictable as it is loud and flashy . because , sometimes , europeans like to surprise themselves . because eurovision is europe . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany last as voters " run and hide " germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .

it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .
because eurovision is as whimsical and unpredictable as it is loud and flashy . because , sometimes , europeans like to surprise themselves . because eurovision is europe . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany last as voters " run and hide " germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action .

"
police in bavaria are in hot pursuit of a motorist who avoids paying to fill up at the gas station by leaving a " friend " as collateral and failing to reappear . ok , gas prices are prohibitively high , but some people will stop at nothing to get out of paying to fill up . one young woman from saxony told a cashier at a gas station in münchberg , bavaria , that , oops , she did n't seem to have any cash on her .
in a display of forbearance unusual in a country where people like to stick to the rules , the girl allowed her to head off to the nearest bank , accepting the motorist 's friend as surety . no show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a jungle out there but two hours later , she 'd failed to return .
her faith in human nature no doubt dashed forever , the luckless cashier called the cops . as for the " friend " - police investigations suggest she was probably an unwitting victim of a mean-minded hoax rather than a willing accomplice .
apparently , it was n't the first time this tight-fisted trickster had pulled off the stunt - she 's been bamboozling gas stations and girl-friends across the country . and while she drove off into the sunset , her long-suffering human deposit had no choice but to take the train home . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .

" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .
the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- said the government was allowing deutsche telekom to establish a new monopoly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plays catch-up in the it world germany 's it branch is showing signs of recovery just as the government kicks off a year-long program focused on promoting information technology .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .
the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- said the government was allowing deutsche telekom to establish a new monopoly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plays catch-up in the it world germany 's it branch is showing signs of recovery just as the government kicks off a year-long program focused on promoting information technology .

in its annual corruption report , transparency international estimates that corruption costs germany 's healthcare system between 8 and 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 and 30 billion -rrb- a year . in its latest yearbook , the german chapter of the non-profit , non-governmental organization working to counter corrupt international business and government practices warned against the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on doctors and researchers and called for tougher action against those who abuse the system . it alleged that the most serious aspect of corruption in the german health system is the influence exerted by the pharmaceuticals industry on the licensing , medical and therapeutic assessment and marketing of products .
ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .
" " we also have about 250 separate statutory insurance companies , while in other countries the health system is handled much more centrally .
it goes without saying that under such circumstances the power of the functionaries has got rather out of control . " pharmaceuticals-fixing according to transparency international , the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry is particularly critical . ti pharmacologist peter schönhofer says the industry has adapted its products to marketing possibilities and not the other way round : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much do doctors know ?
" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .
these included inviting doctors to further education seminars , which schönhofer dismissed as a means to advertise a company 's products . that 's not all .
" faking medical research has also become considerably more common , " added schönhofer . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between companies and clients need to be made public calling for more effective measures to combat corruption , transparency international said insurance companies , organizations of doctors who treat non-privately insured patients and medical associations should work more professionally . it also proposed treating leading functionaries in professional corporations as office-bearers who would face punishment in cases of corruption , making ties between sponsors and experts more transparent , and finally , introducing forgery-proof pharmaceutical packaging to curb illegal trading in medicines . brian pickering -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .
-lrb- may 4 , 2005 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .

in its annual corruption report , transparency international estimates that corruption costs germany 's healthcare system between 8 and 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 and 30 billion -rrb- a year . in its latest yearbook , the german chapter of the non-profit , non-governmental organization working to counter corrupt international business and government practices warned against the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on doctors and researchers and called for tougher action against those who abuse the system . it alleged that the most serious aspect of corruption in the german health system is the influence exerted by the pharmaceuticals industry on the licensing , medical and therapeutic assessment and marketing of products .
ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .
" " we also have about 250 separate statutory insurance companies , while in other countries the health system is handled much more centrally .
it goes without saying that under such circumstances the power of the functionaries has got rather out of control . " pharmaceuticals-fixing according to transparency international , the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry is particularly critical . ti pharmacologist peter schönhofer says the industry has adapted its products to marketing possibilities and not the other way round : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much do doctors know ?
" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .
these included inviting doctors to further education seminars , which schönhofer dismissed as a means to advertise a company 's products . that 's not all .
" faking medical research has also become considerably more common , " added schönhofer . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between companies and clients need to be made public calling for more effective measures to combat corruption , transparency international said insurance companies , organizations of doctors who treat non-privately insured patients and medical associations should work more professionally . it also proposed treating leading functionaries in professional corporations as office-bearers who would face punishment in cases of corruption , making ties between sponsors and experts more transparent , and finally , introducing forgery-proof pharmaceutical packaging to curb illegal trading in medicines . brian pickering -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .
that 's why the world cup actually offers germans a unique chance as hosts to work on their image - as long as nothing happens .

"
police in bavaria are in hot pursuit of a motorist who avoids paying to fill up at the gas station by leaving a " friend " as collateral and failing to reappear . ok , gas prices are prohibitively high , but some people will stop at nothing to get out of paying to fill up . one young woman from saxony told a cashier at a gas station in münchberg , bavaria , that , oops , she did n't seem to have any cash on her .
in a display of forbearance unusual in a country where people like to stick to the rules , the girl allowed her to head off to the nearest bank , accepting the motorist 's friend as surety . no show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a jungle out there but two hours later , she 'd failed to return .
her faith in human nature no doubt dashed forever , the luckless cashier called the cops . as for the " friend " - police investigations suggest she was probably an unwitting victim of a mean-minded hoax rather than a willing accomplice .
apparently , it was n't the first time this tight-fisted trickster had pulled off the stunt - she 's been bamboozling gas stations and girl-friends across the country . and while she drove off into the sunset , her long-suffering human deposit had no choice but to take the train home . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .
the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- said the government was allowing deutsche telekom to establish a new monopoly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plays catch-up in the it world germany 's it branch is showing signs of recovery just as the government kicks off a year-long program focused on promoting information technology .

ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .
" " we also have about 250 separate statutory insurance companies , while in other countries the health system is handled much more centrally .
it goes without saying that under such circumstances the power of the functionaries has got rather out of control . " pharmaceuticals-fixing according to transparency international , the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry is particularly critical . ti pharmacologist peter schönhofer says the industry has adapted its products to marketing possibilities and not the other way round : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much do doctors know ?
" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .
these included inviting doctors to further education seminars , which schönhofer dismissed as a means to advertise a company 's products . that 's not all .
" faking medical research has also become considerably more common , " added schönhofer . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ties between companies and clients need to be made public calling for more effective measures to combat corruption , transparency international said insurance companies , organizations of doctors who treat non-privately insured patients and medical associations should work more professionally . it also proposed treating leading functionaries in professional corporations as office-bearers who would face punishment in cases of corruption , making ties between sponsors and experts more transparent , and finally , introducing forgery-proof pharmaceutical packaging to curb illegal trading in medicines . brian pickering -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2006 it 's eurotrash all over again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly for disco queens : this year 's finnish entry is called ' hard rock hallelujah ' the 51st eurovision song contest opens in athens on thursday with 37 countries and more than 200 artists participating in a quintessentially european festival famed for elevating trash to the level of glamor . what is europe anyway ?
it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2006 it 's eurotrash all over again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly for disco queens : this year 's finnish entry is called ' hard rock hallelujah ' the 51st eurovision song contest opens in athens on thursday with 37 countries and more than 200 artists participating in a quintessentially european festival famed for elevating trash to the level of glamor . what is europe anyway ?
it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .
because eurovision is as whimsical and unpredictable as it is loud and flashy . because , sometimes , europeans like to surprise themselves . because eurovision is europe . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany last as voters " run and hide " germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .

"
police in bavaria are in hot pursuit of a motorist who avoids paying to fill up at the gas station by leaving a " friend " as collateral and failing to reappear . ok , gas prices are prohibitively high , but some people will stop at nothing to get out of paying to fill up . one young woman from saxony told a cashier at a gas station in münchberg , bavaria , that , oops , she did n't seem to have any cash on her .
in a display of forbearance unusual in a country where people like to stick to the rules , the girl allowed her to head off to the nearest bank , accepting the motorist 's friend as surety . no show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a jungle out there but two hours later , she 'd failed to return .

apparently , it was n't the first time this tight-fisted trickster had pulled off the stunt - she 's been bamboozling gas stations and girl-friends across the country . and while she drove off into the sunset , her long-suffering human deposit had no choice but to take the train home . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?

he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .
that 's why the world cup actually offers germans a unique chance as hosts to work on their image - as long as nothing happens . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .
-lrb- may 18 , 2006 -rrb- former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots a guide to potential racial hot spots in germany will go live on the internet and be published in brochure form in time to warn visitors to the world cup of areas known for far-right extremism .

a national friendliness campaign is pumping millions into putting the smile on every german face .

it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .
because eurovision is as whimsical and unpredictable as it is loud and flashy . because , sometimes , europeans like to surprise themselves . because eurovision is europe . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany last as voters " run and hide " germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .

" it 's complete fabrication , " said schöllgen .
" there is no mention of this at all in the new testament .
dan brown cites his source as the gospel of philip from the 2nd century ad , but even then the theory is unsubstantiated .
it 's definitely a stretch . " brown himself , meanwhile , has defended the novel and said the churches should be happy because after all , his book sparked a renewed interest in christian history and promoted spiritual discussion . winning formula the success of his book appeared to happen almost overnight , but in fact , brown worked hard to become one of time magazine 's most influential people in the world .

" the da vinci code " might be one of the most talked-about films of the year , but the critics have crucified it . based on author dan brown 's 2003 thriller which has been translated into 44 languages and sold over 50 million copies , " the da vinci code " opened the cannes film festival wednesday amid the usual glitz , glamor and hype . but the movie about " the greatest conspiracy of the last 2000 years " looks set to be one of the greatest flops of 2006 . in it , a renowned harvard symbologist is summoned to the louvre museum in paris to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to da vinci 's artwork . when he breaks the code , he uncovers the key to one of the most baffling mysteries of all time and becomes a hunted man . hollywood expected it to be a guaranteed crowd-pleaser - but audiences in cannes begged to differ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the da vinci code " opened the cannes film festival despite the major buildup , expensive marketing campaign and a-list stars , the premiere ended up producing more snickers than gasps from the assembled journalists and movie critics .
the general public might have been a little more forgiving , but few reviewers had anything good to say about what 's been billed as the most eagerly-awaited movie of the year . controversy both the book and the film version of " the da vinci code " have been fuelled by controversy right from the start . as the film 's publicity engine gathered momentum in recent months , religious groups began calling for a ban , or at least a disclaimer explaining that the plot was purely fictional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the last supper " by leonardo da vinci many were insulted by the central concept , which revolves around the theory that the catholic church covered up the fact that jesus married mary magdalene , creating a lineage that still exists today . most of the criticism was n't even ideological .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .
the association of telecommunications and value-added service providers -lrb- vatm -rrb- said the government was allowing deutsche telekom to establish a new monopoly . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plays catch-up in the it world germany 's it branch is showing signs of recovery just as the government kicks off a year-long program focused on promoting information technology .

in its annual corruption report , transparency international estimates that corruption costs germany 's healthcare system between 8 and 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 10 and 30 billion -rrb- a year . in its latest yearbook , the german chapter of the non-profit , non-governmental organization working to counter corrupt international business and government practices warned against the increasing influence of the pharmaceutical industry on doctors and researchers and called for tougher action against those who abuse the system . it alleged that the most serious aspect of corruption in the german health system is the influence exerted by the pharmaceuticals industry on the licensing , medical and therapeutic assessment and marketing of products .
ti accused companies of paying doctors to prescribe their products , infiltrating self-help groups and using dubious studies in their marketing strategies . state-by-state system creates complexity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal differences make health care a complex business transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- said that over the past few decades , fraud , waste and corruption had well and truly eaten into the structures of germany 's health system , which is organized on a state-by-state basis .
in its " yearbook corruption 2006 , " it said that owing to the market power of the pharmaceutical industry and its associations , the system 's obscure structures could hardly be understood . " one of the main problems for our susceptibility to corruption in germany is linked to the fact that whereas other countries have one health minister , we have 17 – 16 state ministers and one federal minister , " said ti board member anke martiny .
" " we also have about 250 separate statutory insurance companies , while in other countries the health system is handled much more centrally .
it goes without saying that under such circumstances the power of the functionaries has got rather out of control . " pharmaceuticals-fixing according to transparency international , the behavior of the pharmaceutical industry is particularly critical . ti pharmacologist peter schönhofer says the industry has adapted its products to marketing possibilities and not the other way round : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much do doctors know ?
" since 1990 , about 460 new substances have come onto the market , but only seven of them are genuine innovations , " he said .
" another 25 offered improvements .
pseudo-innovations are produced with the sole purpose of raising the price . " schönhofer also pointed out that none of the other 460 products improved patients ' chances of being cured and would only be marketed by employing corruption strategies .

the struggle between pragmatists and fundamentalists is part of the party ’ s tradition , but will it tear them apart ? it could be described as a watershed event for the greens .
in frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , the party had signed what was for fundis - the party 's fundamental ideologists - a deal with the devil .
the greens now govern in frankfurt with the very party that used to represent the antithesis of their beliefs , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in the process , they resigned themselves to accepting projects that went against the grain of their traditional politics - the building of an autobahn tunnel and the expansion of frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has been a battleground for grassroots greens for decades the emotional debate during the greens ' frankfurt party caucus at the beginning of may , and the cool ending of it by the realos - the party 's pragmatic wing whose name comes from realpolitik - was just a microcosm of the greens ' ideological battle since its birth in 1980 .
eco-freaks against power-hungry " traitors . "
forests given up for economic goals .
it has been a balancing act that has generated ceaseless debates within the party .
still a protest party people usually associate the greens with the environment and the peace movement .
protests and demonstrations were once the order of the day .
yet gone are the times when tens of thousands gathered for anti-nuclear protests .
after all , germany has committed itself to closing down all its atomic power stations by 2021 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato air strikes on belgrade were reason enough to leave the party and war ?
the greens decided it can not be avoided sometimes when they supported nato air strikes against belgrade in 1999 .
indeed , that military operation left such a bitter aftertaste that strongly pacifistic green members , if they still are members , cringe when the subject is brought up .
" for fundis , the main issues are environment and the peace movement .
the green leadership had difficulty getting the point across that other issues , such as civil and human rights , or immigration play a major role in the party , " said hajo funke of the freie university in berlin .
nevertheless , the greens are a " protest " party , and remain so , according to funke .
it 's just that the protest touch is not as dominant as in the past .
one could say that the greens have exited the rebelliousness of political puberty and are entering young adulthood .
less glamor , more competence a look at the party 's web site reveals this clearly .
the top item is the poor chances for immigrant children in german schools , followed by the party 's position on germany 's intelligence service having spied on journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after joschka fischer 's departure , renate künast -lrb- r . -rrb- became a prominent party leader " the greens have an obvious voter base , one that is concerned about the environment .
but the party 's new co-chairwoman , renate künast , is very pragmatic , well-organized and has found new problems to concentrate on .
one part of the party 's profile is civil rights , " said funke .
furthermore , humanitarian missions , such as one that could send un troops to darfur , are acceptable as long as peace is the intention .
the topics are less glamorous , but funke believes the party leadership - even without its pr figure no. 1 , former foreign minister joschka fischer - is highly competent .
governing with the cdu deemed anti-social pragmatism is prevalent at all levels of the party .
coalitions solely with the social democrats as an option now appear hardly realistic .
daniel cohn-bendit , head of the greens in the european parliament , has said that governing with the conservative christian democrats offers " good political perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra kelly was a founder of the green party jutta ditfurth , a prominent leader during the party 's infancy who left it in 1991 , viewed the greens as a party in decline .
the far-left author called the cdu-green coalition in her city a " pact . "
" two factions are joining up that have very clear messages in frankfurt .
they are against the underprivileged , the poor and welfare recipients .
the greens handed the social welfare office to the cdu due to sheer incompetence , " ditfurth said .
for her , the greens have exhausted their effectiveness , no matter who they govern with .
when petra kelly founded what she called " the anti-party party , " ditfurth thought that a decade was the maximum it should remain in politics .
it has been 26 now , 16 too many for her .
" we had 10 years , and during eight of those , we were able to make left-wing politics popular with slogans like ' out of nato , ' women 's emancipation , radical views against nuclear energy .
these topics were n't on people 's minds in the 1970s , " she said . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens prepare for new role after seven , sometimes turbulent , years in government , what 's next for the world 's most successful green party ?
the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication .
-lrb- sept .
28 , 2005 -rrb- an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2006 former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors with dark skin should watch where they go , heye said world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go .
they might not make it out alive , " uwe-karsten heye told deutschlandradio kultur . heye was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government spokesman from 1998 to 2002 .
he now runs an anti-racist action group called gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- . his remarks provoked angry reactions .
in brandenburg , state premier matthias platzeck , a fellow social democrat , called the comments an " absurd slur of a whole region that is no way justifiable . "
brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said heye should resign from his position at gesicht zeigen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye while extremism and xenophobia should n't be minimized , said wolfgang bosback , a leading cdu parliamentarian , " you ca n't stamp broad areas of the new german states or of the state of brandenburg suspicious and at least indirectly declare them so-called no-go areas . "
he added that it would be " fatal " if comments such as heye 's would cause people not to come to the world cup .
no-go areas but heye also received backing from other quarters .

he pointed out that the africa council had already declared some parts of germany , including brandenburg , dangerous for black people . the state of brandenburg , which surrounds berlin , was the scene of a brutal attack on a 37-year-old man of ethiopian origin in april . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup guide highlights germany 's racist hotspots a guide to potential racial hot spots in germany will go live on the internet and be published in brochure form in time to warn visitors to the world cup of areas known for far-right extremism .

police in bavaria are in hot pursuit of a motorist who avoids paying to fill up at the gas station by leaving a " friend " as collateral and failing to reappear . ok , gas prices are prohibitively high , but some people will stop at nothing to get out of paying to fill up . one young woman from saxony told a cashier at a gas station in münchberg , bavaria , that , oops , she did n't seem to have any cash on her .
in a display of forbearance unusual in a country where people like to stick to the rules , the girl allowed her to head off to the nearest bank , accepting the motorist 's friend as surety . no show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a jungle out there but two hours later , she 'd failed to return .
her faith in human nature no doubt dashed forever , the luckless cashier called the cops . as for the " friend " - police investigations suggest she was probably an unwitting victim of a mean-minded hoax rather than a willing accomplice .
apparently , it was n't the first time this tight-fisted trickster had pulled off the stunt - she 's been bamboozling gas stations and girl-friends across the country . and while she drove off into the sunset , her long-suffering human deposit had no choice but to take the train home . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.05.2006 it 's eurotrash all over again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly for disco queens : this year 's finnish entry is called ' hard rock hallelujah ' the 51st eurovision song contest opens in athens on thursday with 37 countries and more than 200 artists participating in a quintessentially european festival famed for elevating trash to the level of glamor . what is europe anyway ?
it is a big chunk of land between the ural mountains and the atlantic ocean , half of which rotted away for decades behind the iron curtain , while the other half became a pathetic periphery of the mighty fast-food empire .
in the aftermath of the fall of communism and eu expansion , the old continent is still a cacophony of real and imagined voices ; a mishmash of pretentious high culture and archaic customs ; a modern tower of babel in the landscape of self-delusions and dreams of past glory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , angelica agurbash from belarus delighted with three different outfits yet despite the books about the crisis of european transcendental phenomenology or the crisis of the european subject ; despite the stalled european constitution - or , should we say : despite the french being difficult and the dutch being stingy ? - and despite the absurd royal families and their even more absurd supporters , europe is really in no danger of disappearing from the face of the earth . that is , as long as it has its very own eurovision song contest . a continental tradition since 1956 , the grand prix de la chanson has fanatic followers and bitter foes .
the former like to point out that abba may have ended up earning their bread in a massage parlor in uppsala , if it had n't been for their phenomenal 1974 victory .
the latter like to shut the former 's mouth by pointing out that the world could 've been spared celine dion 's whining , had she not won the competition in 1988 . yet , the truth of the matter is that no other cultural institution or sporting event can unite the europeans - foes and friends alike - in such a delightful celebration of gaudiness and bad taste . did anybody say ' balkanization ' ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pop star sakis rouvas , who came third in 2004 , will be hosting the competition in athens this year take the balkan states , for example .
they 've been at each other throats for centuries .
they are responsible for the worst atrocities on the continent since the end of world war ii .
they still beat each other up regularly at soccer matches .
but as soon as you let them onto the eurovision stage , they magically transform into ambassadors of joy and international understanding . when serbia and montenegro 's medieval techno-pop funeral hymn almost won the 2004 contest - it came second only to the ukrainian lion tamer and leather domina ruslana - the balkan countries , which passionately and shadily voted for each other 's songs , swore they could n't remember what the wars were about in the first place . that is not to say that internally things are always that rosy .
serbia and montenegro , now in the last stages of final disintegration , will not participate in athens this year because the ever-shrinking country could n't get its act together and elect a song that both states would agree on .
but that does n't mean that they wo n't be friends again next year .
we fight , we make peace .
we cry together , we laugh together .
life is a cabaret . the twilight zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish entry this year is another spectacular example of eastern european sense for fashion hosted this year by greek national broadcaster ert , the eurovision song contest will consist of a semi-final on thursday and a final on saturday , with audiences in europe , turkey and israel registering their votes or sending sms messages to a central database . so , who will win this year ?
will it be the finnish rock group lordi - a hard rock quintet kitted out in monster masks and medieval armor , or severina - the croatian pamela anderson , whose videotaped sex romps delighted the balkan machos at least as much as her folk songs a couple of years ago ?
will germany 's texas lightening manage to save the country 's face after the last year 's debacle when gracia 's song - with a sadly appropriate title " run and hide " - made every german want to do exactly the same ? it 's hard to tell .
because eurovision is as whimsical and unpredictable as it is loud and flashy . because , sometimes , europeans like to surprise themselves . because eurovision is europe . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany last as voters " run and hide " germany 's entry in the 50th eurovision song contest finished last with four votes as greece took the crown at the celebration of kitsch in kiev on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.05.2006 eu threatens legal action against germany over broadband großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bone of contention : high-speed connections germany appears determined to pass a new telecommunications law that critics say would give deutsche telekom a monopoly over broadband connections .
the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .
that 's why the world cup actually offers germans a unique chance as hosts to work on their image - as long as nothing happens .

"
police in bavaria are in hot pursuit of a motorist who avoids paying to fill up at the gas station by leaving a " friend " as collateral and failing to reappear . ok , gas prices are prohibitively high , but some people will stop at nothing to get out of paying to fill up . one young woman from saxony told a cashier at a gas station in münchberg , bavaria , that , oops , she did n't seem to have any cash on her .
in a display of forbearance unusual in a country where people like to stick to the rules , the girl allowed her to head off to the nearest bank , accepting the motorist 's friend as surety . no show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a jungle out there but two hours later , she 'd failed to return .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2006 are the greens turning on their roots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the eco-party have drifted too far after being voted out of power in federal elections , the eco-friendly greens are going through changes .
the struggle between pragmatists and fundamentalists is part of the party ’ s tradition , but will it tear them apart ? it could be described as a watershed event for the greens .
in frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , the party had signed what was for fundis - the party 's fundamental ideologists - a deal with the devil .
the greens now govern in frankfurt with the very party that used to represent the antithesis of their beliefs , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in the process , they resigned themselves to accepting projects that went against the grain of their traditional politics - the building of an autobahn tunnel and the expansion of frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has been a battleground for grassroots greens for decades the emotional debate during the greens ' frankfurt party caucus at the beginning of may , and the cool ending of it by the realos - the party 's pragmatic wing whose name comes from realpolitik - was just a microcosm of the greens ' ideological battle since its birth in 1980 .
eco-freaks against power-hungry " traitors . "
forests given up for economic goals .
it has been a balancing act that has generated ceaseless debates within the party .
still a protest party people usually associate the greens with the environment and the peace movement .
protests and demonstrations were once the order of the day .
yet gone are the times when tens of thousands gathered for anti-nuclear protests .
after all , germany has committed itself to closing down all its atomic power stations by 2021 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato air strikes on belgrade were reason enough to leave the party and war ?
the greens decided it can not be avoided sometimes when they supported nato air strikes against belgrade in 1999 .
indeed , that military operation left such a bitter aftertaste that strongly pacifistic green members , if they still are members , cringe when the subject is brought up .
" for fundis , the main issues are environment and the peace movement .
the green leadership had difficulty getting the point across that other issues , such as civil and human rights , or immigration play a major role in the party , " said hajo funke of the freie university in berlin .
nevertheless , the greens are a " protest " party , and remain so , according to funke .
it 's just that the protest touch is not as dominant as in the past .
one could say that the greens have exited the rebelliousness of political puberty and are entering young adulthood .
less glamor , more competence a look at the party 's web site reveals this clearly .
the top item is the poor chances for immigrant children in german schools , followed by the party 's position on germany 's intelligence service having spied on journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after joschka fischer 's departure , renate künast -lrb- r . -rrb- became a prominent party leader " the greens have an obvious voter base , one that is concerned about the environment .
but the party 's new co-chairwoman , renate künast , is very pragmatic , well-organized and has found new problems to concentrate on .
one part of the party 's profile is civil rights , " said funke .
furthermore , humanitarian missions , such as one that could send un troops to darfur , are acceptable as long as peace is the intention .
the topics are less glamorous , but funke believes the party leadership - even without its pr figure no. 1 , former foreign minister joschka fischer - is highly competent .
governing with the cdu deemed anti-social pragmatism is prevalent at all levels of the party .
coalitions solely with the social democrats as an option now appear hardly realistic .
daniel cohn-bendit , head of the greens in the european parliament , has said that governing with the conservative christian democrats offers " good political perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra kelly was a founder of the green party jutta ditfurth , a prominent leader during the party 's infancy who left it in 1991 , viewed the greens as a party in decline .
the far-left author called the cdu-green coalition in her city a " pact . "
" two factions are joining up that have very clear messages in frankfurt .
they are against the underprivileged , the poor and welfare recipients .
the greens handed the social welfare office to the cdu due to sheer incompetence , " ditfurth said .
for her , the greens have exhausted their effectiveness , no matter who they govern with .
when petra kelly founded what she called " the anti-party party , " ditfurth thought that a decade was the maximum it should remain in politics .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action .

"
police in bavaria are in hot pursuit of a motorist who avoids paying to fill up at the gas station by leaving a " friend " as collateral and failing to reappear . ok , gas prices are prohibitively high , but some people will stop at nothing to get out of paying to fill up . one young woman from saxony told a cashier at a gas station in münchberg , bavaria , that , oops , she did n't seem to have any cash on her .
in a display of forbearance unusual in a country where people like to stick to the rules , the girl allowed her to head off to the nearest bank , accepting the motorist 's friend as surety . no show bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a jungle out there but two hours later , she 'd failed to return .

apparently , it was n't the first time this tight-fisted trickster had pulled off the stunt - she 's been bamboozling gas stations and girl-friends across the country . and while she drove off into the sunset , her long-suffering human deposit had no choice but to take the train home . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in germany , gas station attendants at your service gas stations in germany face stiff competition .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .

his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go .
they might not make it out alive , " uwe-karsten heye told deutschlandradio kultur . heye was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government spokesman from 1998 to 2002 .
he now runs an anti-racist action group called gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- . his remarks provoked angry reactions .
in brandenburg , state premier matthias platzeck , a fellow social democrat , called the comments an " absurd slur of a whole region that is no way justifiable . "

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2006 are the greens turning on their roots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the eco-party have drifted too far after being voted out of power in federal elections , the eco-friendly greens are going through changes .
the struggle between pragmatists and fundamentalists is part of the party ’ s tradition , but will it tear them apart ? it could be described as a watershed event for the greens .
in frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , the party had signed what was for fundis - the party 's fundamental ideologists - a deal with the devil .
the greens now govern in frankfurt with the very party that used to represent the antithesis of their beliefs , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in the process , they resigned themselves to accepting projects that went against the grain of their traditional politics - the building of an autobahn tunnel and the expansion of frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has been a battleground for grassroots greens for decades the emotional debate during the greens ' frankfurt party caucus at the beginning of may , and the cool ending of it by the realos - the party 's pragmatic wing whose name comes from realpolitik - was just a microcosm of the greens ' ideological battle since its birth in 1980 .
eco-freaks against power-hungry " traitors . "
forests given up for economic goals .
it has been a balancing act that has generated ceaseless debates within the party .
still a protest party people usually associate the greens with the environment and the peace movement .
protests and demonstrations were once the order of the day .
yet gone are the times when tens of thousands gathered for anti-nuclear protests .
after all , germany has committed itself to closing down all its atomic power stations by 2021 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato air strikes on belgrade were reason enough to leave the party and war ?
the greens decided it can not be avoided sometimes when they supported nato air strikes against belgrade in 1999 .
indeed , that military operation left such a bitter aftertaste that strongly pacifistic green members , if they still are members , cringe when the subject is brought up .
" for fundis , the main issues are environment and the peace movement .
the green leadership had difficulty getting the point across that other issues , such as civil and human rights , or immigration play a major role in the party , " said hajo funke of the freie university in berlin .
nevertheless , the greens are a " protest " party , and remain so , according to funke .
it 's just that the protest touch is not as dominant as in the past .
one could say that the greens have exited the rebelliousness of political puberty and are entering young adulthood .
less glamor , more competence a look at the party 's web site reveals this clearly .
the top item is the poor chances for immigrant children in german schools , followed by the party 's position on germany 's intelligence service having spied on journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after joschka fischer 's departure , renate künast -lrb- r . -rrb- became a prominent party leader " the greens have an obvious voter base , one that is concerned about the environment .
but the party 's new co-chairwoman , renate künast , is very pragmatic , well-organized and has found new problems to concentrate on .
one part of the party 's profile is civil rights , " said funke .
furthermore , humanitarian missions , such as one that could send un troops to darfur , are acceptable as long as peace is the intention .
the topics are less glamorous , but funke believes the party leadership - even without its pr figure no. 1 , former foreign minister joschka fischer - is highly competent .
governing with the cdu deemed anti-social pragmatism is prevalent at all levels of the party .
coalitions solely with the social democrats as an option now appear hardly realistic .
daniel cohn-bendit , head of the greens in the european parliament , has said that governing with the conservative christian democrats offers " good political perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra kelly was a founder of the green party jutta ditfurth , a prominent leader during the party 's infancy who left it in 1991 , viewed the greens as a party in decline .
the far-left author called the cdu-green coalition in her city a " pact . "
" two factions are joining up that have very clear messages in frankfurt .
they are against the underprivileged , the poor and welfare recipients .
the greens handed the social welfare office to the cdu due to sheer incompetence , " ditfurth said .
for her , the greens have exhausted their effectiveness , no matter who they govern with .
when petra kelly founded what she called " the anti-party party , " ditfurth thought that a decade was the maximum it should remain in politics .
it has been 26 now , 16 too many for her .
" we had 10 years , and during eight of those , we were able to make left-wing politics popular with slogans like ' out of nato , ' women 's emancipation , radical views against nuclear energy .
these topics were n't on people 's minds in the 1970s , " she said . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens prepare for new role after seven , sometimes turbulent , years in government , what 's next for the world 's most successful green party ?

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .
" there is a right-wing extremist milieu .
yes , brandenburg could certainly do with more cosmopolitanism and openness .
but you do n't get there by placing an entire state under suspicion .
to approach others without prejudice , to be open to other views is frankly not just a demand that should be addressed to us in brandenburg . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye " can he say that ? " asked der tagesspiegel , in berlin , and offered the answer .
" of course he can . "
it 's heye 's role as head of an organization that fights right-wing violence to admonish people - and he 's not saying anything that is n't true , the paper continued .
" even in liberal potsdam there are racist attacks , " it wrote , pointing to the recent beating of an ethiopian-born german as proof .
" germany is not able to rid itself of its history .
that 's why an admonisher needs to be careful not to make people think that bat-carrying skinheads are a regular sight in germany .
politicians , however , have an even greater responsibility to show that this is a cosmopolitan country that prosecutes nazis without mercy - so that heye can remain silent . " meanwhile , the kieler nachrichten in northern germany said that germans still prefer to keep quiet about xenophobic attacks .
" three weeks before the world cup , nothing and no one should dampen the good mood , " it wrote .
" that 's why heye is berated like a traitor . "
the hysterical reactions from politicians and the warnings against possible damage to germany 's image seem hypocritical , the daily continued .
" it 's society 's duty to protect foreigners against racist violence .
germany 's image abroad will become friendlier when politicians are determined to deal with right-extremists and people stand up and show courage " against racist attacks . in southwestern germany , the mannheimer morgen said it was n't surprising that international travel guides warned people of " no-go areas " in eastern german cities .
" naturally , the state politicians affected reject this criticism , " it continued .
" but the attack on german-ethiopian ermyas m. in potsdam showed what reality is like .

former government spokesman uwe-karsten heye has advised foreigners to avoid certain areas of eastern germany because of possible racist attacks .
many western papers agree with heye , but eastern editorials are outraged . the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt wrote that as a former government spokesman , heye must have known what would happen after he said what he said .
" but did he really think about the consequences ? " asked the paper .
" the debate will go as usual .
in the west , people will say : ' there you have it , the east is brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- .
and in the east , people will be so upset about such generalizations that the necessary discussion about how safe foreigners are in our cities will fall by the wayside .
instead , the right-wing extremists will know how to use the uproar to gain sympathy for their absurd ideology .
it 's easy to fight a problem with a steam hammer .
but sometimes that only increases the problem . " " yes , there are right-wing thugs , " conceded the märkische oderzeitung from frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in the eastern state of brandenburg .

the eu has threatened legal action . shortly after germany 's cabinet agreed on the new telecommunications law on wednesday , viviane reding , the european union commissioner for information society and media warned that she would not accept the legislation . " we can not afford to create new monopolies out of short-term political opportunism , " reding said .
" should the german parliament follow the proposal of the government , i am determined to open an infringement procedure against germany . " if passed by the bundestag , the legislation would exempt deutsche telekom 's planned € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- broadband network from price regulation .
competitors would not be allowed to use the network for years . " we remain convinced that the new version -lrb- of the law -rrb- complies with european regulations , " a spokesman for the german economics ministry said .
new monopoly ?
deutsche telekom has argued that it ca n't build the fiber optics network without assurances that the investment will be worthwhile for the company .
the new network is supposed to offer high-speed connections of up to 50 megabits per second in 50 german cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not smiling now : viviane reding a spokesman for deutsche telekom said that reding 's view of the german market was " screwy , " reuters reported .
he added that when it comes to broadband range , there 's more competition in germany than anywhere else in europe . reding said germany has far fewer broadband connections per capita than many other eu countries for which reason the government should encourage more competition . deutsche telekom competitors have also been critical of the new law .
the national broadband communication association breko said the expansion of the fiber optics network was an attempt to quell competition on the broadband market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2006 are the greens turning on their roots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the eco-party have drifted too far after being voted out of power in federal elections , the eco-friendly greens are going through changes .
the struggle between pragmatists and fundamentalists is part of the party ’ s tradition , but will it tear them apart ? it could be described as a watershed event for the greens .
in frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , the party had signed what was for fundis - the party 's fundamental ideologists - a deal with the devil .
the greens now govern in frankfurt with the very party that used to represent the antithesis of their beliefs , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in the process , they resigned themselves to accepting projects that went against the grain of their traditional politics - the building of an autobahn tunnel and the expansion of frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has been a battleground for grassroots greens for decades the emotional debate during the greens ' frankfurt party caucus at the beginning of may , and the cool ending of it by the realos - the party 's pragmatic wing whose name comes from realpolitik - was just a microcosm of the greens ' ideological battle since its birth in 1980 .
eco-freaks against power-hungry " traitors . "
forests given up for economic goals .
it has been a balancing act that has generated ceaseless debates within the party .
still a protest party people usually associate the greens with the environment and the peace movement .
protests and demonstrations were once the order of the day .
yet gone are the times when tens of thousands gathered for anti-nuclear protests .
after all , germany has committed itself to closing down all its atomic power stations by 2021 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato air strikes on belgrade were reason enough to leave the party and war ?
the greens decided it can not be avoided sometimes when they supported nato air strikes against belgrade in 1999 .
indeed , that military operation left such a bitter aftertaste that strongly pacifistic green members , if they still are members , cringe when the subject is brought up .
" for fundis , the main issues are environment and the peace movement .
the green leadership had difficulty getting the point across that other issues , such as civil and human rights , or immigration play a major role in the party , " said hajo funke of the freie university in berlin .
nevertheless , the greens are a " protest " party , and remain so , according to funke .
it 's just that the protest touch is not as dominant as in the past .
one could say that the greens have exited the rebelliousness of political puberty and are entering young adulthood .
less glamor , more competence a look at the party 's web site reveals this clearly .
the top item is the poor chances for immigrant children in german schools , followed by the party 's position on germany 's intelligence service having spied on journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after joschka fischer 's departure , renate künast -lrb- r . -rrb- became a prominent party leader " the greens have an obvious voter base , one that is concerned about the environment .
but the party 's new co-chairwoman , renate künast , is very pragmatic , well-organized and has found new problems to concentrate on .
one part of the party 's profile is civil rights , " said funke .
furthermore , humanitarian missions , such as one that could send un troops to darfur , are acceptable as long as peace is the intention .
the topics are less glamorous , but funke believes the party leadership - even without its pr figure no. 1 , former foreign minister joschka fischer - is highly competent .
governing with the cdu deemed anti-social pragmatism is prevalent at all levels of the party .
coalitions solely with the social democrats as an option now appear hardly realistic .
daniel cohn-bendit , head of the greens in the european parliament , has said that governing with the conservative christian democrats offers " good political perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra kelly was a founder of the green party jutta ditfurth , a prominent leader during the party 's infancy who left it in 1991 , viewed the greens as a party in decline .
the far-left author called the cdu-green coalition in her city a " pact . "
" two factions are joining up that have very clear messages in frankfurt .
they are against the underprivileged , the poor and welfare recipients .
the greens handed the social welfare office to the cdu due to sheer incompetence , " ditfurth said .
for her , the greens have exhausted their effectiveness , no matter who they govern with .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2006 are the greens turning on their roots ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the eco-party have drifted too far after being voted out of power in federal elections , the eco-friendly greens are going through changes .
the struggle between pragmatists and fundamentalists is part of the party ’ s tradition , but will it tear them apart ? it could be described as a watershed event for the greens .
in frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , the party had signed what was for fundis - the party 's fundamental ideologists - a deal with the devil .
the greens now govern in frankfurt with the very party that used to represent the antithesis of their beliefs , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in the process , they resigned themselves to accepting projects that went against the grain of their traditional politics - the building of an autobahn tunnel and the expansion of frankfurt international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has been a battleground for grassroots greens for decades the emotional debate during the greens ' frankfurt party caucus at the beginning of may , and the cool ending of it by the realos - the party 's pragmatic wing whose name comes from realpolitik - was just a microcosm of the greens ' ideological battle since its birth in 1980 .
eco-freaks against power-hungry " traitors . "
forests given up for economic goals .
it has been a balancing act that has generated ceaseless debates within the party .
still a protest party people usually associate the greens with the environment and the peace movement .
protests and demonstrations were once the order of the day .
yet gone are the times when tens of thousands gathered for anti-nuclear protests .
after all , germany has committed itself to closing down all its atomic power stations by 2021 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato air strikes on belgrade were reason enough to leave the party and war ?
the greens decided it can not be avoided sometimes when they supported nato air strikes against belgrade in 1999 .
indeed , that military operation left such a bitter aftertaste that strongly pacifistic green members , if they still are members , cringe when the subject is brought up .
" for fundis , the main issues are environment and the peace movement .
the green leadership had difficulty getting the point across that other issues , such as civil and human rights , or immigration play a major role in the party , " said hajo funke of the freie university in berlin .
nevertheless , the greens are a " protest " party , and remain so , according to funke .
it 's just that the protest touch is not as dominant as in the past .
one could say that the greens have exited the rebelliousness of political puberty and are entering young adulthood .
less glamor , more competence a look at the party 's web site reveals this clearly .
the top item is the poor chances for immigrant children in german schools , followed by the party 's position on germany 's intelligence service having spied on journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after joschka fischer 's departure , renate künast -lrb- r . -rrb- became a prominent party leader " the greens have an obvious voter base , one that is concerned about the environment .
but the party 's new co-chairwoman , renate künast , is very pragmatic , well-organized and has found new problems to concentrate on .
one part of the party 's profile is civil rights , " said funke .
furthermore , humanitarian missions , such as one that could send un troops to darfur , are acceptable as long as peace is the intention .
the topics are less glamorous , but funke believes the party leadership - even without its pr figure no. 1 , former foreign minister joschka fischer - is highly competent .
governing with the cdu deemed anti-social pragmatism is prevalent at all levels of the party .
coalitions solely with the social democrats as an option now appear hardly realistic .
daniel cohn-bendit , head of the greens in the european parliament , has said that governing with the conservative christian democrats offers " good political perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra kelly was a founder of the green party jutta ditfurth , a prominent leader during the party 's infancy who left it in 1991 , viewed the greens as a party in decline .
the far-left author called the cdu-green coalition in her city a " pact . "
" two factions are joining up that have very clear messages in frankfurt .
they are against the underprivileged , the poor and welfare recipients .
the greens handed the social welfare office to the cdu due to sheer incompetence , " ditfurth said .
for her , the greens have exhausted their effectiveness , no matter who they govern with .
when petra kelly founded what she called " the anti-party party , " ditfurth thought that a decade was the maximum it should remain in politics .
it has been 26 now , 16 too many for her .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action .

his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go .
they might not make it out alive , " uwe-karsten heye told deutschlandradio kultur . heye was former chancellor gerhard schröder 's government spokesman from 1998 to 2002 .
he now runs an anti-racist action group called gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- . his remarks provoked angry reactions .
in brandenburg , state premier matthias platzeck , a fellow social democrat , called the comments an " absurd slur of a whole region that is no way justifiable . "
brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said heye should resign from his position at gesicht zeigen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye while extremism and xenophobia should n't be minimized , said wolfgang bosback , a leading cdu parliamentarian , " you ca n't stamp broad areas of the new german states or of the state of brandenburg suspicious and at least indirectly declare them so-called no-go areas . "
he added that it would be " fatal " if comments such as heye 's would cause people not to come to the world cup .
no-go areas but heye also received backing from other quarters .
" the reality is that school classes with many migrant children ask whether it 's safe to go camping in brandenburg or mecklenburg-western pomerania , " said daniel-cohn bendit , green party leader in the european parliament . social democratic parliamentarian sebastian edathy said heye 's warning was fully comprehensible .
" here the message is not the messenger 's fault , " he said .
edathy , whose father comes from india , added that there were certain areas of berlin , such as the eastern treptow district , where he would n't take the train at night .

" the commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated -lrb- eu -rrb- antitrust rules that prohibit restrictive business practices and / or abuse of a dominant market position , " it said in a statement . inspections do not signal guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on imports about half of germany 's gas the eu executive did not name the firms that had been visited .
german utilities rwe and eon , austrian energy firm omv , belgian gas groups fluxys and distrigas , french state-controlled gaz de france , italian energy group eni and hungarian state-owned power supplier mvm , however , all confirmed they had received inspectors . spokespeople from both the german companies said they were working closing with the regulators but would not give additional details , according to the associated press .
eon-ruhrgas imports nearly half of the gas used in germany . commission spokesman jonathan todd stressed that the raids , which mark the first steps in probes into suspected anti-competitive practices , did not necessarily mean that the companies were guilty of breaking eu law . inspectors were looking for evidence that the gas companies had restricted access to pipelines and storage facilities and agreed to divide the market , he said . inspections welcomed by consumer groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an extra cold german winter boosted gas revenues " it is obvious that there is no competition in the gas market , " holger krawinkel of germany 's federal association for consumer protection told the tagesspiegel newspaper on thursday . brussels has long complained about a lack of competition among eu energy companies and earlier this year warned that it would use its antitrust powers to crack down on companies it considered to be blocking competition . " the commission has made greater competition in the energy sector a priority but it is finding that prices are n't moving , " added jean-francois bellis , of the brussels ' free university .
" so it 's normal that it takes action . " several months are likely to be needed before the eu regulators decide to lodge formal charges against the companies targeted by the raids . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brussels could act against spain over takeover block spain could face punitive measures from the eu over its attempts to block the takeover of spanish energy company endesa by germany 's e.on.

" the da vinci code " might be one of the most talked-about films of the year , but the critics have crucified it . based on author dan brown 's 2003 thriller which has been translated into 44 languages and sold over 50 million copies , " the da vinci code " opened the cannes film festival wednesday amid the usual glitz , glamor and hype . but the movie about " the greatest conspiracy of the last 2000 years " looks set to be one of the greatest flops of 2006 . in it , a renowned harvard symbologist is summoned to the louvre museum in paris to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to da vinci 's artwork . when he breaks the code , he uncovers the key to one of the most baffling mysteries of all time and becomes a hunted man . hollywood expected it to be a guaranteed crowd-pleaser - but audiences in cannes begged to differ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the da vinci code " opened the cannes film festival despite the major buildup , expensive marketing campaign and a-list stars , the premiere ended up producing more snickers than gasps from the assembled journalists and movie critics .
the general public might have been a little more forgiving , but few reviewers had anything good to say about what 's been billed as the most eagerly-awaited movie of the year . controversy both the book and the film version of " the da vinci code " have been fuelled by controversy right from the start . as the film 's publicity engine gathered momentum in recent months , religious groups began calling for a ban , or at least a disclaimer explaining that the plot was purely fictional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the last supper " by leonardo da vinci many were insulted by the central concept , which revolves around the theory that the catholic church covered up the fact that jesus married mary magdalene , creating a lineage that still exists today . most of the criticism was n't even ideological .
others took offense simply because brown 's book is so , well , bad . " it 's a truly awful book riddled with mistakes , " said german publisher michael krüger .
" it 's neither a well-told story , interesting , nor anything at all . " confusing fact and fiction but after wednesday 's debacle , the churches at least are breathing a sigh of relief .
they 're confident that viewers wo n't confuse fact with fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has divided the critics " the jesus portrayed -lrb- in the movie -rrb- has nothing to do with the historical jesus , " said georg schöllgen , a professor of religious history in bonn , germany .
" the fictional one is sexually active , married , and pioneered women 's emancipation by making his wife a priest .
sure it 's fascinating , but it 's a bit too simplified . " experts have also argued that brown has n't checked his facts , especially regarding the relationship between jesus and mary magdalene .
" it 's complete fabrication , " said schöllgen .
" there is no mention of this at all in the new testament .
dan brown cites his source as the gospel of philip from the 2nd century ad , but even then the theory is unsubstantiated .
it 's definitely a stretch . " brown himself , meanwhile , has defended the novel and said the churches should be happy because after all , his book sparked a renewed interest in christian history and promoted spiritual discussion . winning formula the success of his book appeared to happen almost overnight , but in fact , brown worked hard to become one of time magazine 's most influential people in the world .
after aborting a career as a pop star , he turned his hand to writing , only to be turned down by publisher after publisher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dan brown , one of the world 's most successful writers but with " the da vinci code , " he knew he was on to a winner .
with all the successful ingredients for a bestseller , it was a pot-boiler about secret societies steeped in controversy and conspiracy .

the march follows a statement from malian mps , calling on mr sarkozy to call off his " undesirable " visit .
mr sarkozy arrived in mali on wednesday at the start of visit to west africa .
he is to hold talks with the leaders of mali and benin , after a tough immigration bill was strongly backed by french mps on wednesday .
the bill , which must also be passed by the french senate , offers residence permits to highly qualified newcomers from outside the european union .
it requires immigrants from outside the eu to sign a contract agreeing to learn french and to respect the principles of the french republic , and makes it more difficult for them to bring their families over to join them .
mr sarkozy says he wants to reduce illegal immigration , and has been behind the deportation of many malians .
ahead of his arrival , more than 20 mps said he should not visit mali .
' provocation ' wednesday 's march to the french embassy was organised by the association of malians expelled from france , which is also calling for a sit-in on thursday in front of the hotel where mr sarkozy is staying .
french bill only the qualified get " skills and talents " residency permit foreigners only allowed in to work , not live off benefits foreign spouses to wait longer for residence cards migrants must agree to learn french migrants must sign ' contract ' respecting french way of life scraps law on workers getting citizenship after 10 years they held banners reading " sarkozy , neo-nazi " and " immediate halt to deportations " .
one of the mps who called for mr sarkozy to cancel his visit joined the march .
" we are indignant about this visit and we honestly think that the arrival of mr nicolas sarkozy in our country at this time is purely and simply a provocation , " said the mps , who come from two regions - kayes and gao .
many of the malians living in france come from the western region of kayes , while gao is at a key staging post on the migration route from west africa across the sahara desert to morocco and then europe .
" we ask malian members of parliament and all malians who love peace and justice to act so that mr sarkozy cancels his 17 may trip , " the mps said .
the french bill has also attracted controversy in france .
socialist mp serge blisko said it amounted to " the organised pillaging of brains " , and the french anti-racism organisation sos racisme has called it " dangerous " .
mr sarkozy , the son of a hungarian immigrant , has praised the contribution of skilled migrants to france but insists that those who entered illegally must be sent back .
police sources say that planes carrying deportees arrive in mali every day , some carrying 70 people expelled from france .
in the 1990s , many malians were outraged when france used charter flights to deport illegal immigrants .

many of the malians living in france come from the western region of kayes , while gao is at a key staging post on the migration route from west africa across the sahara desert to morocco and then europe .
nicolas sarkozy wants to deport more illegal immigrants " we ask malian members of parliament and all malians who love peace and justice to act so that mr sarkozy cancels his 17 may trip , " the mps said .
the french bill has also attracted controversy in france .
socialist mp serge blisko said it amounted to " the organised pillaging of brains " , and the french anti-racism organisation sos racisme has called it " dangerous " .
mr sarkozy , the son of a hungarian immigrant , has praised the contribution of skilled migrants to france but insists that those who entered illegally must be sent back .
police sources say that planes carrying deportees arrive in mali every day , some carrying 70 people expelled from france .
in the 1990s , many malians were outraged when france used charter flights to deport illegal immigrants .

" that 's why we 're so passionate about this .
we 're just hoping loads of people will come down and eat with us now . "
the director of south west tourism , malcolm bell , said although cornwall was poor in economic terms it had " massive potential " and that was what jamie oliver was supporting .
" there is a huge quality of life here , and it is a county which is going places , not just a place with problems , " he said .
the profile the fifteen restaurant gave cornwall and the interest it attracted was " critical " , mr bell said .
foundation director mark scothern said : " although our work has been going on for some months now , it is exciting to see all the training and preparation coming together .
" there are so many great aspects to this venture that will provide awesome opportunities for everyone involved , particularly young adults from communities in cornwall that want chances to develop and improve their quality of life . "
melbourne restaurant the 100-seater restaurant , which also has a 12-seater private dining area , is oliver 's latest fifteen project .
his first opened in shoreditch , east london , after the nation followed its trials in a channel 4 tv series .
since then he has opened another in amsterdam , and a fourth is due to open in melbourne , australia , in september .
cornwall is no stranger to playing host to high-profile chefs .
padstow is home to rick stein 's empire which began nearly 30 years ago with the seafood restaurant .
in recent years it has expanded to include a bistro , bed and breakfast and a fish and chip shop , leading to the town being nicknamed " padstein " .

the nikkei fell below the 16,000 mark for the first time in eight weeks and shares dipped by 2.4 % during trading .
japan 's drop was echoed in hong kong , south korea , taiwan , australia and singapore , which fell by up to 3 % .
higher-than-expected us consumer prices on wednesday also worried the markets as oil prices boosted inflation .
south asian markets followed suit , with bombay 's sensex index sliding 872 points or 7.1 % - a one-day record - to 11,346 points .
inflation and interest rates " the market is very afraid of inflation and about the possibility of -lsb- us -rsb- interest rate increases , " said kim joong-hyan , a seoul-based analyst with goodmorning shinan securities .
the higher inflation figures could force the us central bank to raise interest rates further , which could hurt the prospects for economic growth .
" rather than any domestic factor , i think the decline in us stocks is pretty much 100 % responsible for the fall in tokyo today , " said soichiro monki , at daiwa sb investment .
higher interest rates also make it more expensive for companies to borrow and thereby eat into company profits .
mining stocks were particularly affected by the falling markets , with bhp billiton losing 3.4 % in australia and the country 's overall market falling by 1.5 % .
south korean markets dropped to 7-week lows - falling almost 3 % - with lender kookmin bank , shinhan finance group and samsung electronics losing 2 % .
further turmoil falls in asia came after the us index of leading shares , the dow jones industrial average , saw its biggest one-day fall in three years , knocking off $ 64bn from the value of the top 30 firms listed in the index .
similarly britain 's ftse 100 index lost 170 points - its biggest one-day fall since october 2002 - and £ 123bn was wiped off the value of europe 's top 300 firms on wednesday .
also prompting the fall across markets wednesday was the release of eurozone inflation figures , which rose faster than expected to 2.4 % in april .
this increases the likelihood of a rate increase by the european central bank next month from its existing 2.5 % level .
some analysts are saying that recent market upheaval could be a forerunner to more serious turmoil , with a sharp turnaround in expectations about the future course of inflation and interest rates worldwide .

putty-nosed monkeys in west africa share the human ability to combine different sounds to mean different things , according to researchers .
st andrews university , uk , scientists found the creatures , in nigeria 's gashaka gumti national park , used two main call types to warn of predators .
but a particular sequence of calls also appeared to mean something else .
the scientists identified two call types - " pyows " and " hacks " - which the monkeys use to alert each other to danger ; but found a string of pyows warned of a loitering leopard , while a burst of hacks indicated a hovering eagle . "
this is the first good example of animal calls being combined in meaningful ways " dr kate arnold a sentence made up of several pyows , followed by a few hacks , told the group to move to safer ground .
' ignore meaning ' dr kate arnold , a primate psychologist , discovered the phenomena by playing variations of the calls back to the monkeys to see how they behaved .
this showed they could encode fresh information by combining two existing calls , rather than creating a new sound , she said .
" these calls were not produced randomly and a number of distinct patterns emerged , " she said .
" the pyow-hack sequence means something like ' let 's go ' , whereas the pyows by themselves have multiple functions and the hacks are generally used as alarm calls .
" this is the first good example of animal calls being combined in meaningful ways .
" the implications of this research are that primates , at least , may be able to ignore the usual relationship between an individual call and any meaning that it might convey under certain circumstances . "
the research has been carried out over the past three years , and has been published in the scientific journal nature .

putty-nosed monkeys in west africa share the human ability to combine different sounds to mean different things , according to researchers .
st andrews university , uk , scientists found the creatures , in nigeria 's gashaka gumti national park , used two main call types to warn of predators .
but a particular sequence of calls also appeared to mean something else .
the scientists identified two call types - " pyows " and " hacks " - which the monkeys use to alert each other to danger ; but found a string of pyows warned of a loitering leopard , while a burst of hacks indicated a hovering eagle .
this is the first good example of animal calls being combined in meaningful ways dr kate arnold a sentence made up of several pyows , followed by a few hacks , told the group to move to safer ground .
' ignore meaning ' dr kate arnold , a primate psychologist , discovered the phenomena by playing variations of the calls back to the monkeys to see how they behaved .
this showed they could encode fresh information by combining two existing calls , rather than creating a new sound , she said .
" these calls were not produced randomly and a number of distinct patterns emerged , " she said .
" the pyow-hack sequence means something like ' let 's go ' , whereas the pyows by themselves have multiple functions and the hacks are generally used as alarm calls .
" this is the first good example of animal calls being combined in meaningful ways .
" the implications of this research are that primates , at least , may be able to ignore the usual relationship between an individual call and any meaning that it might convey under certain circumstances . "
the research has been carried out over the past three years , and has been published in the scientific journal nature .

the soldiers ' stories are part of a new version of america 's army , a game which is part of its recruitment strategy .
the us military denies that the project is a way of selling an unpopular war to the american public .
instead the free game is designed to inspire young people by relating the real-life experiences of the troops .
" the majority of the public is not touched by the war , " said major jason amerine , who served in afghanistan and is one of the nine soldiers appearing in the game .
" it is dangerous to have an army overseas fighting and for a public to become so disconnected that they do n't realise that we are not automatons over there .
we 're real people , " he told the bbc news website .
' real heroes ' america 's army was first released in july 2002 and has gone on to become one of the top online games , with seven million registered players .
it taps into the popularity of military and war simulation titles among predominantly young men . "
it shows we are not robots , that we 're not trained killing machines .
we 're just people " matt zedwick , national guardsman it was developed by the army to simulate combat and life in the military and reach young people for whom video games are a part of everyday life .
in the latest version of the game , called america 's army : special forces -lrb- overmatch -rrb- , the military is adding the experiences of nine soldiers who served in afghanistan or iraq .
the title has a so-called real heroes section when players can learn about the real-life troops .
in a virtual recruiting room , gamers can click on a soldier to hear them tell their story .
they can also compare their achievements in the game to those of the gis .
" it gets our stories out there about what the army is doing , " said sergeant matt zedwick , who served and was wounded during a tour of duty in iraq in 2004 .
" it is a good communications device to introduce people to what is really going on , rather than what you see on the news . "
" it shows we are not robots , that we 're not trained killing machines .
we 're just people , " said the 25-year-old who is now studying graphic design at a college in oregon .
reaching the public the us military sees america 's army as an information , rather than as a recruitment , tool .
the latest version was showcased at last week 's e3 games expo in los angeles and is due to be released in the summer .
it comes at a time of growing unease in the us about the war in iraq .
and last year , an official us government study warned that the military was falling behind in its effort to recruit troops for combat operations in iraq and afghanistan .
but the people involved in the title say there is no connection between the new game and america 's troubles over its combat operations .
" we 're not talking about the war , we 're talking about people in the war , " insisted major amerine , who served in afghanistan in 2001 during the initial invasion .
" we are not attempting in any way to sell a war to the people , that has nothing to do with our agenda .
" we 're trying to create awareness about the people doing the fighting , and that is a very apolitical agenda , " said the major who now teaches at west point .
toy soldiers as part of " real heroes " campaign , figures of the soldiers featured in the game are to go on sale .
the army says these are not designed to be toys for children but items for collectors who wish to express their support for the troops .
seeing themselves as little plastic soldiers is a strange experience for the troops involved .
" it is kinda funny and a little creepy .
unbelievable in a way , " said sergeant zedwick .
" it is kind of funny to think there are going to be millions of people buying little dolls of you in the stores . "

about £ 900m will be in the form of a loan with commercial rates of interest , which must be repaid by 2013 .
the other £ 850m comes from existing royal mail reserves , which it will be allowed to use to shore up a pensions deficit now totalling £ 5.6bn.
over the past year the royal mail said it saw profits rise 17 % to £ 355m .
the profits will trigger staff bonuses of more than £ 400 per person .
huge pension scheme deficit bbc business editor robert peston said the fact that the £ 900m was being given as a loan " makes it difficult for competitors to call it a subsidy and claim that it breaches european union rules " .
have your say of course they should get the money .
they are there to offer a service to the public roy hills , eastbourne send us your comments speaking on bbc breakfast , royal mail chairman allan leighton , insisted the government was n't bailing out the company .
" we 're just like any company , we 're a commercial entity that provides a public service , " he said .
" like any company , we can go to the market - and in this case , that happens to be our shareholder , who happens to be the government - and say , ' look , we think we can give you a cracking return - five times what you put in - so why do n't you try and invest in us and we 'll deliver that sort of return for you ' . "
" so , as i say , to keep going on about all this news about rescues and bale-outs and stuff like that is wide of the mark . "
the £ 850m from reserves is essentially money that the royal mail owns , but can not use freely due to existing arrangements with the government .
as part of the investment package , the royal mail will be able to put the money into a special account for the exclusive use of the pension fund - to help reassure pensioners that their savings are safe .
in addition to the £ 5.6bn pension deficit , the royal mail badly needs money to modernise its sorting offices now that the uk postal market has been opened up to greater competition .
last year , the company 's bosses said that they would need to invest as much as £ 2bn to upgrade equipment if they were to survive .
since then the royal mail has been improving efficiency and profits .

about £ 900m will be in the form of a loan with commercial rates of interest , which must be repaid by 2013 .
the other £ 850m comes from existing royal mail reserves , which it will be allowed to use to shore up a pensions deficit now totalling £ 5.6bn.
over the past year the royal mail said it saw profits rise 17 % to £ 355m .
the profits will trigger staff bonuses of more than £ 400 per person .

the researchers , from the drug company merck , isolated platensimycin from a sample of south african soil .
if the compound passes clinical trials it will become only the third entirely new antibiotic developed in the last four decades .
details in the journal nature reveal the antibiotic works in a completely different way to all others .
we very much need new drugs in the pipeline as soon as we can professor tony maxwell it acts to block enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids , which bacteria need to construct cell membranes .
most classes of antibiotic were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s , and work by blocking synthesis of the cell wall , dna and proteins within bacteria .
most of today 's antibiotics are simply tweaks of this basic format .
the fact that they work in similar ways may be one reason why bacteria are proving so adept at developing resistance .
thus a new class of antibiotics with a different method of action could represent a major breakthrough .
natural extracts the researchers hit upon platensimycin during a project in which they screened 250,000 natural product extracts for their antibiotic potential .
it is produced by a strain of the bacteria streptomyces platensis .
in lab tests , the antibiotic cleared mice of infection with a form of bacteria related to mrsa and did not appear to cause toxic side effects .
further testing showed activity against a variety of drug-resistant organisms , including mrsa .
professor tony maxwell , who is carrying out similar work at the john innes centre -lrb- jic -rrb- at colney in norfolk , uk , said : " this sounds very promising .
" a number of big pharmaceutical firms have pulled out of antibiotic drug discovery .
" with mrsa cases increasing , and the number of new drugs on the market decreasing , we very much need new drugs in the pipeline as soon as we can . "
alan johnson , an expert at the health protection agency , said : " there is an increasing problem with antibiotic resistance .
" the agency welcomes the news that a new antibiotic has been identified that could help to treat infections , particularly those caused by organisms such as mrsa which are resistant to many currently available drugs .
" it should be stressed , however , that the drug is at a very early stage of development and it may be several years before it could be used to treat humans . "

the nuclear decommissioning authority -lrb- nda -rrb- blamed the costs involved of keeping it open , in evidence to the welsh affairs select committee .
wylfa is due to close in 2010 .
the island 's council had called for wylfa to continue in operation but has since backed the idea of anglesey having a second nuclear station .
the existing power station supplies electricity directly to the metal smelting plant anglesey aluminium in holyhead .
both plants are major employers on the island and a report has claimed the planned closure of the power station in 2010 would lead to both sites shutting , with a combined loss of 1,500 jobs .
metal casing councillors on anglesey had originally called for a two-year stay of execution for wylfa and ultimately for a new nuclear power station - wylfa b - to be built on the island , near cemaes .
the nuclear plant uses magnox fuel in january this year , enterprise minister andrew davies confirmed he had asked the uk government to look at keeping wylfa open beyond 2010 .
but giving evidence to the welsh select committee on wednesday , the nda 's regional director brian burnett said wylfa 's future was linked to operations at other sites .
he said the fuel used in the ageing magnox reactors uses a special magnesium metal casing but the factory making them had ceased production .
the body 's engineering director , richard white , responding to a question from ynys mon mp albert owen , said the nda was in the process of carrying out a feasibility study on the costs of continuing power generation at the plant beyond 2010 .
' economic arguments ' he said : " at the moment i think it would be fair to say that it 's looking unlikely that an overall positive business case would be generated .
" when you take account of the costs of a wylfa , springfield and sellafield operation extension and what all that means , against even optimistic views of the electricity pricing , it 's not looking positive at the moment . "
mr owen said : " there are strong economic arguments to keep it open but it 's always likely to be difficult and the nda 's report is likely to say that those technical difficulties are going to be a massive challenge for them . "
both wylfa and the anglesey aluminium works were developed in the early 1970s .

election officials confirmed his party won 36 seats in the 71-member parliament , while the party led by ethnic indian mahendra chaudhry won 31 .
there has been no violence reported as a result of the racially-charged poll .
however , fiji faces the prospect of political instability as its powerful military leader warned he was unhappy with mr qarase 's election victory .
fiji 's military commander has been a vocal critic of the prime minister 's plans to offer amnesties to those involved in a coup six years ago , which deposed mr chaudhry , who was then serving as the country 's first ethnic indian prime minister .
commodore frank bainimarama has in the past threatened to remove the government if such controversial legislation was passed .
mr qarase told the bbc 's world today programme on thursday that he would introduce a revised bill ordering parliament to set up a commission to investigate the coup .
he admitted a possible outcome could be an amnesty for the coup leaders .
race is a central issue in fiji , where indigenous fijians make up about 55 % of the country 's population , while most of the rest are of indian origin .
the poll pitted mr qarase 's indigenous sdl party against the fiji labour party , led by ethnic indian mr chaudhry .
support from independents mr qarase claimed victory after most of the votes had been counted on wednesday .
but official results were only available later - and even now the ballots for one seat have yet to be counted .
according to the official results , the sdl -lrb- soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua -rrb- party won 36 seats in the 71-seat parliament .
mr qarase also claims to have the support of two independents , giving him a majority of 38 seats .
mr chaudhry 's labour party won 31 seats , but is also thought to have the support of two candidates from a minor party .
mr qarase said on wednesday that he would abide by the constitution and invite his labour rivals into a new cabinet .
but he said he hoped mr chaudhry would opt instead to remain in opposition , as he did after the 2001 election .
" i do n't believe in a multi-party cabinet .
i believe that the party that wins should take it all , like in most other democracies , " mr qarase said .

biologists from the university of st andrews in fife want to work out at what frequencies and volume the orcas show signs of stress .
sound is considered as important to some marine mammals as sight is to us .
some scientists believe that military sonar - powerful sound waves - could be harming whales and dolphins .
the issues are examined on thursday in the bbc radio 4 programme costing the earth .
a few metres below the waves , sound is the only way to communicate , navigate or hunt .
yet oceans are now full of background noise from shipping , drilling and naval exercises .
cetaceans -lrb- whales , dolphins and porpoises -rrb- have to swim through what some researchers described as " acoustic fog " .
sonic stress a report released in february by the inter-agency committee on marine science and technology said research into the effects of sound in the oceans on marine mammals should be commissioned by the uk government .
the report identified 13 cases of strandings by whales and dolphins which appear to have been linked to specific sources of noise ; most of those sources involved naval vessels .
post-mortem evidence gathered after a number of whales beached themselves during military exercises in the canary islands four years ago indicated the presence of tiny gas bubbles in the animals ' internal organs , particularly the liver , which scientists believe is linked somehow to sonar .
a team from the sea mammal research unit at st andrews wants to attach transmitters to a pod of orcas off norway and study their behaviour as they turn up the sonar .
when they show signs of stress by swimming away or not feeding , the sound would be stopped .
the researchers argue this is the only way to prove exactly how sound waves affect cetaceans so they can advise navies or geologists how to avoid harming marine mammals .
but some animal welfare groups are uneasy , saying the research only yields results when the animal begins to suffer .

post-mortem evidence gathered after a number of whales beached themselves during military exercises in the canary islands four years ago indicated the presence of tiny gas bubbles in the animals ' internal organs , particularly the liver , which scientists believe is linked somehow to sonar .
a team from the sea mammal research unit at st andrews wants to attach transmitters to a pod of orcas off norway and study their behaviour as they turn up the sonar .
when they show signs of stress by swimming away or not feeding , the sound would be stopped .
the researchers argue this is the only way to prove exactly how sound waves affect cetaceans so they can advise navies or geologists how to avoid harming marine mammals .
but some animal welfare groups are uneasy , saying the research only yields results when the animal begins to suffer .
costing the earth is on bbc radio 4 on thursday at 2100 .
the programme is repeated on friday at 1500 .

election officials confirmed his party won 36 seats in the 71-member parliament , while the party led by ethnic indian mahendra chaudhry won 31 .
there has been no violence reported as a result of the racially-charged poll .
however , fiji faces the prospect of political instability as its powerful military leader warned he was unhappy with mr qarase 's election victory .
fiji 's military commander has been a vocal critic of the prime minister 's plans to offer amnesties to those involved in a coup six years ago , which deposed mr chaudhry , who was then serving as the country 's first ethnic indian prime minister .
commodore frank bainimarama has in the past threatened to remove the government if such controversial legislation was passed .
mr qarase told the bbc 's world today programme on thursday that he would introduce a revised bill ordering parliament to set up a commission to investigate the coup .
he admitted a possible outcome could be an amnesty for the coup leaders .
race is a central issue in fiji , where indigenous fijians make up about 55 % of the country 's population , while most of the rest are of indian origin .
the poll pitted mr qarase 's indigenous sdl party against the fiji labour party , led by ethnic indian mr chaudhry .
support from independents mr qarase claimed victory after most of the votes had been counted on wednesday .
but official results were only available later - and even now the ballots for one seat have yet to be counted .
according to the official results , the sdl -lrb- soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua -rrb- party won 36 seats in the 71-seat parliament .
mr qarase also claims to have the support of two independents , giving him a majority of 38 seats .
mr chaudhry 's labour party won 31 seats , but is also thought to have the support of two candidates from a minor party .
mr qarase said on wednesday that he would abide by the constitution and invite his labour rivals into a new cabinet .
but he said he hoped mr chaudhry would opt instead to remain in opposition , as he did after the 2001 election .
" i do n't believe in a multi-party cabinet .
i believe that the party that wins should take it all , like in most other democracies , " mr qarase said .

election officials confirmed his party won 36 seats in the 71-member parliament , while the party led by ethnic indian mahendra chaudhry won 31 .
there has been no violence reported as a result of the racially-charged poll .
however , fiji faces the prospect of political instability as its powerful military leader warned he was unhappy with mr qarase 's election victory .
fiji 's military commander has been a vocal critic of the prime minister 's plans to offer amnesties to those involved in a coup six years ago , which deposed mr chaudhry , who was then serving as the country 's first ethnic indian prime minister .
commodore frank bainimarama has in the past threatened to remove the government if such controversial legislation was passed .
mr qarase told the bbc 's world today programme on thursday that he would introduce a revised bill ordering parliament to set up a commission to investigate the coup .
he admitted a possible outcome could be an amnesty for the coup leaders .
race is a central issue in fiji , where indigenous fijians make up about 55 % of the country 's population , while most of the rest are of indian origin .
the poll pitted mr qarase 's indigenous sdl party against the fiji labour party , led by ethnic indian mr chaudhry .
support from independents mr qarase claimed victory after most of the votes had been counted on wednesday .
but official results were only available later - and even now the ballots for one seat have yet to be counted .
according to the official results , the sdl -lrb- soqosoqo duavata ni lewenivanua -rrb- party won 36 seats in the 71-seat parliament .
mr qarase also claims to have the support of two independents , giving him a majority of 38 seats .
mr chaudhry 's labour party won 31 seats , but is also thought to have the support of two candidates from a minor party .
mr qarase said on wednesday that he would abide by the constitution and invite his labour rivals into a new cabinet .
but he said he hoped mr chaudhry would opt instead to remain in opposition , as he did after the 2001 election .
" i do n't believe in a multi-party cabinet .
i believe that the party that wins should take it all , like in most other democracies , " mr qarase said .

west bengal police said a special team arrested mrinal hazarika , a senior leader of the united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- , early on thursday .
mr hazarika was detained at a hotel in the town of siliguri , police say .
assam 's police intelligence chief told the bbc that mr hazarika held the rank of a self-styled ulfa " major " .
khagen sarma described the ulfa leader as a " major catch " and said he was being questioned by the west bengal police .
he said that " at some point " he may be handed over to police in assam .
mr hazarika is the second top leader to be caught by the security forces in the past month .
in april , ulfa 's western zone commander , lal deka , was killed in a clash with the army .
' direct talks ' police said mr hazarika had replaced mr deka and was visiting siliguri to raise funds for the underground organisation .
ulfa is currently holding peace negotiations with the indian government through a committee of civil society leaders called the people 's consultative group -lrb- pcg -rrb- .
the pcg has twice met indian government officials but ulfa has yet to announce a formal ceasefire , although it says that it wants an end to military operations in assam .
assam chief minister tarun gogoi , after being sworn in again for a second term this week , called on ulfa leaders to announce a formal ceasefire and join " direct talks " with the government .
but the ulfa leadership is upset over what it says is the continuing police and military operation against its fighters , and says that the atmosphere for talks has been spoiled .
thousands of people have died since ulfa began fighting for independence in 1979 .

employment is not growing as fast as working age population , nor are wages rising as rapidly as per capita income .
there are many reasons for this - some to do with forces of globalisation that are beyond the indian government 's policy reach .
but much of it has to do with the ' culture ' that pervades our labour markets , which in turn is a consequence of the complicated and ill-conceived laws that govern the labour market .
the travails of calcutta 's famous great eastern hotel illustrates nicely much of what is wrong .
in india there are 45 laws at the national level and close to four times that at the level of state governments send your comments on kaushik basu 's article the hotel , founded in 1840 by a british confectioner , david wilson -lrb- and originally named auckland hotel -rrb- , prospered for a long time ; but began to flounder in the early 1970s .
worried about the many workers of the hotel , the congress government took over its management in 1975 ; and , driven by similar concerns , the communist-led left front government nationalised it in 1980 .
protected from the vicissitudes of the market , the hotel 's quality continued to decline and staff size grew .
too many laws according to some back-of-the-envelope calculations i did some time ago , it came to have such a high staff-to-rooms ratio that it was not clear why the hotel needed customers .
if it moved its staff members into the hotel , it would be a self-sufficient housing complex , if slightly over-crowded .
fortunately , the government has since taken restructuring measures and there are hopes of the hotel 's revival .
but what happened for over 30 years is a mirror to much that ails indian labour .
in india there are 45 laws at the national level and close to four times that at the level of state governments that monitor the functioning of labour markets .
less than 10 million workers are employed in the private sector some of these date almost as far back as the founding of the great eastern hotel .
they were meant to control conflict and keep the labour market efficient .
unfortunately , the experience has been to the contrary .
according to recent world bank estimates , in 2004 , there were 482 cases of major work stoppages , resulting in 15 million human days of work loss .
between 1995 and 2001 around 9 % of factory workers were involved in these stoppages .
the figure for china is close to zero .
on the other hand , the wages of chinese workers are rising much faster than that of india 's .
these facts are not unrelated .
short-sighted policy most of india 's labour laws were crafted with scant respect for ' market response . '
if x seemed bad , the presumption was that you had to simply enact a law banning x. but the fact that each law leads entrepreneurs and labourers to respond strategically , often in complicated ways , was paid no heed .
in a poor country no one with any sensitivity wants workers to lose their jobs .
so what does one do ?
india needs to employ workers under different contracts the instinct is to make it difficult for firms to layoff workers .
that is exactly what india 's industrial disputes act , 1947 , did , especially through some later amendments , for firms in the formal sector and employing more than 100 workers .
but in today 's globalised world , with volatile and shifting demand , firms have responded to this by keeping their labour forces as small as possible .
it is little wonder that in a country as large as india less than 10 million workers are employed in the formal private sector .
some commentators have argued that india 's labour laws could not have had much of a consequence since most of them apply to only the formal sector .
what they fail to realise is that one reason the formal sector has remained miniscule is because of these laws -lrb- and also the culture that the laws have spawned -rrb- .
need for flexibility what is needed now is not a law that allows employers to fire workers at will but one that allows for different kinds of contracts .
some workers may sign a contract for a high wage but one that requires them to quit at short notice ; others may seek the opposite .
this would allow firms to employ different kinds of labour depending on the volatility of the market they operated in .
flexibility in hiring and firing is not the only problem .
india 's complex web of legislation leads to a system of dispute resolution that is incredibly slow .
data from the ministry of labour reveal that in the year 2000 there were 533,038 disputes pending in india 's labour courts ; and of these 28,864 had been pending for over 10 years .
if india is to be a vibrant global economy , this has to change .
much of the debate on labour laws has been misconstrued .
we do not need changes in labour laws and policy to elicit sacrifice from organised labour , as some economists have suggested .
indian workers , whether they be in the organised sector or the unorganised sector , are too poor for that .
we need changes in order to create greater private-sector demand for labour , which will boost wages and employment .
in brief , we need to move to a system that -lrb- 1 -rrb- makes room for more flexible contracts in the labour market , -lrb- 2 -rrb- has a minimal welfare net for workers who are out of work , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- resolves labour market disputes more quickly .
here is a selection of your comments on this article .
a real eye-opener on labour issues in contemporary times .
one of the significant issues with the workers would be the social safety net which may be absent with many private enterprises .
it will be of paramount importance to ensure that a worker at least could look after his family meeting their basic necessities , have his / her children get good education , and so on .
lekha nath bhattarai , nepal what indian government needs to realise is the fact that by attempting to protect labour and contain layoffs , they have crippled the corporations ' ability to make profits .
by relaxing the laws and implementing more government subsidies to small businesses , management will employ more workers and the average wage as well as employment will increase .
rohit , usa indian workers in the public sector are so protected that even if you do n't do anything you 'll get your pay right on time and if you want a bit more all you have to do is stop working .
this is why the quality of service in the public sector in india is very low .
who will care to work properly if you 'll get your salary anyway ?
karl , india prof basu 's comments on labour are well thought out , but , as in all political systems , selling the idea may prove to be impossible .
australia 's government had similar problems selling the work choices legislation to the labour unions in this country .
streamlining labour laws and introducing flexibility in order to compete globally is still unfortunately viewed as one of the ills of globalisation .
although there may be short term negative effects , the overall efficiency gained should in the long run will not only boost productivity , but free up more capital for investment which in turn creates more jobs .
anupam banerji , india / australia this article is a voice of reason .
the most vigorous section of the economy in recent years has been the private sector and if it employs only 10 million out of the many 100s of millions then it will only lead to more economic disparity and social tension .
it is sad that the government is contemplating reservation in private sector instead of much needed labour reforms .
perhaps the private sector and the government can find some middle ground in which labour law is made more reasonable and at the same time the private sector actively trains and employs people from disadvantaged backgrounds .
kiran , india as long as india is going to keep its ancient laws and not change with the times , it is going to find it hard to be the global powerhouse it is trying to potray itself to be .
vijay bysani , chennai , india i hear everybody saying " things will change and improve for the better " .
but in this globalised economy , we might be too late to catch the bus .
those old politicians do not have to lose anything because their lives are almost over .
it is us young people who will pay the price .
atul , new york , us i am surprised that another much ignored section of the indian workforce has not been mentioned here .
it is the booming construction industry , fuelled by returning non resident indians and the growing economy .
but there has to be an improvement in wages - and more importantly - changes to the living conditions of workers on the construction sites .
avinash , india we have to accept the simple fact that constructing a healthy environment in the labour sector is totally dependent on uncorrupted government which traditionally has been difficult to achieve in india .
mathew joseph kochuvelikakathu , morocco i suspect that in a nation heavy on short-termism , strategic thinking will merely be paid lip service .
in my experience what works best is for the government to have as small a footprint as possible and if that means not interfering in the labour markets , then so be it .
laws should prevent exploitation by making it more attractive to be fair and honest , and not by " banning " exploitation as mr basu so rightly points out .
nikhil date , uk under the socialist regimes of the post-independence era , while a right-to-work was not guaranteed , implicitly , a right-not-to-be-fired was in place .
various political parties , particularly those on the left , made it nearly impossible to fire employees .
the consequences of low labour productivity and lack of international competitiveness were not recognised .
easwar , usa interesting piece .
i would be interested to know the source based on which the author claims " less than 10 million workers are employed in the formal private sector " .
that figure seems suspiciously small .

india needs to employ workers under different contracts the instinct is to make it difficult for firms to layoff workers .
that is exactly what india 's industrial disputes act , 1947 , did , especially through some later amendments , for firms in the formal sector and employing more than 100 workers .
but in today 's globalised world , with volatile and shifting demand , firms have responded to this by keeping their labour forces as small as possible .
it is little wonder that in a country as large as india less than 10 million workers are employed in the formal private sector .
some commentators have argued that india 's labour laws could not have had much of a consequence since most of them apply to only the formal sector .
what they fail to realise is that one reason the formal sector has remained miniscule is because of these laws -lrb- and also the culture that the laws have spawned -rrb- .
need for flexibility what is needed now is not a law that allows employers to fire workers at will but one that allows for different kinds of contracts .
some workers may sign a contract for a high wage but one that requires them to quit at short notice ; others may seek the opposite .
this would allow firms to employ different kinds of labour depending on the volatility of the market they operated in .
flexibility in hiring and firing is not the only problem .
india 's complex web of legislation leads to a system of dispute resolution that is incredibly slow .

if india is to be a vibrant global economy , this has to change .
much of the debate on labour laws has been misconstrued .
we do not need changes in labour laws and policy to elicit sacrifice from organised labour , as some economists have suggested .
indian workers , whether they be in the organised sector or the unorganised sector , are too poor for that .
we need changes in order to create greater private-sector demand for labour , which will boost wages and employment .
in brief , we need to move to a system that -lrb- 1 -rrb- makes room for more flexible contracts in the labour market , -lrb- 2 -rrb- has a minimal welfare net for workers who are out of work , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- resolves labour market disputes more quickly .

employment is not growing as fast as working age population , nor are wages rising as rapidly as per capita income .
there are many reasons for this - some to do with forces of globalisation that are beyond the indian government 's policy reach .
but much of it has to do with the ' culture ' that pervades our labour markets , which in turn is a consequence of the complicated and ill-conceived laws that govern the labour market .
the travails of calcutta 's famous great eastern hotel illustrates nicely much of what is wrong .
in india there are 45 laws at the national level and close to four times that at the level of state governments send your comments on kaushik basu 's article the hotel , founded in 1840 by a british confectioner , david wilson -lrb- and originally named auckland hotel -rrb- , prospered for a long time ; but began to flounder in the early 1970s .
worried about the many workers of the hotel , the congress government took over its management in 1975 ; and , driven by similar concerns , the communist-led left front government nationalised it in 1980 .
protected from the vicissitudes of the market , the hotel 's quality continued to decline and staff size grew .
too many laws according to some back-of-the-envelope calculations i did some time ago , it came to have such a high staff-to-rooms ratio that it was not clear why the hotel needed customers .
if it moved its staff members into the hotel , it would be a self-sufficient housing complex , if slightly over-crowded .
fortunately , the government has since taken restructuring measures and there are hopes of the hotel 's revival .
but what happened for over 30 years is a mirror to much that ails indian labour .
