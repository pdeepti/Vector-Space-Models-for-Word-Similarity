germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy .

knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .

since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically .

" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : winter olympics in turin many potential security threats as winter olympics kick off doping allegations tarnish olympics opening court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach 2006 winter olympics open in turin olympics -pipe- 10.02.2006 germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's olympic athletes hope to do it again in turin germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .
one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .

russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .

coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .
we 've had a truce for a while now . " turbo disl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uschi disl could tie bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history biathlon 's combination of cross-country skiing and marksmanship has been a perfect fit for uschi disl .
she has eight olympic and 15 world championship medals in the biathlon .
turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .
if disl wins four medals in turin , she would tie norwegian cross-country skier bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history -lrb- 12 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm already has two olympic gold medals and a silver teammate kati wilhelm , who sports neon red hair , is a favorite after winning two golds and a silver in 2002 . " four years ago , i was a ' no name ' and had no pressure , " said wilhelm , who will carry the german flag during the opening ceremony .
" now it will be a lot tougher . " for the men , ricco gross is expected to build on his seven total olympic medals , more than any other male biathlete . watch for these germa n s , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronny ackermann will threaten for gold in the nordic combined ronny ackermann is a favorite in the nordic combined competition , but probably not amongst his peers .
when he lost to hannu manninen of finland recently , ackermann swung his ski pole and hit manninen , who was celebrating by making a snow angel .
the two refused to shake hands on the medal podium .
but ackermann won the sprint and individual events at the world championships and helped germany to second in the team event . rene sommerfeldt and axel teichmann have taken the past two overall world cup titles in men 's cross-country skiing . martina ertl looks like a potential medalist in the mountains .
she 's won three medals in five separate winter games and competes this time in the combined and giant slalom ski competitions . and watch out for german athletes in women 's skeleton , men 's curling and men 's halfpipe snowboard competitions . a n d the medal cou n t ? not that germans really care , but ladbrokes , the british gambling concern , puts germany at even money to win the most gold medals , and 6-10 to win the most medals of any color in turin .
norway and the united states are not expected to be far behind . ladbrokes officials must certainly maintain , however , that the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why not an eu medal tally ?

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location .

the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .

russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .

russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .

26 with the men 's ice hockey final and the men 's 50km cross country . international olympic committee president jacques rogge told athletes from around 80 countries gathered in the 35,000-capacity stadio olimpico that they were " role models " and that their " conduct will inspire and motivate future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the olympic stadium during the ceremony " our world today is in need of peace , tolerance and brotherhood , " rogge said .
" the values of the olympic games can deliver these to us .
may the games be held in peace , in the true spirit of the olympic truce . " the key moment , as with every olympics , was the conclusion of the parade of athletes into the stadium when , as michael payne , the former marketing director of the international olympic committee , said , viewers see " the fairy tale of the world brought together . " but the show both before and after the parade of athletes was filled with lights , fire , ice and more than a small taste of italy and the world .
while film stars sophia loren and susan sarandon joined bestselling author isabel allende in carrying the olympic flag into the stadium , john lennon 's widow yoko ono and singer peter gabriel performed " imagine . " icons such as operatic star luciano pavarotti and the ballet corps from milan 's famous teatro alla scala performed .
the alps , cows , inline skaters with flames shooting from their helmets , and a much-bigger-than-life ski jumper provided further highlights . firework lights torch the identity of the final flame-bearer , as always , remained a secret right up to the entrance of the flame into the stadium . gold medal skier alberto tomba was widely rumored to have the honor of lighting the olympic flame , but in the end , cross-country skier stefania belmondo , italy 's most decorated winter olympian , won the race . she lit the torch by igniting a massive firework that engulfed the entired stadium and climbed up to the stadium tower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belmondo as she indirectly lit the torch turin-born former top model carla bruni meanwhile carried the italian flag .
beyond turin 's auto manufacturing past , the city is still known as a fashion and design destination . once dominated by struggling car manufacturer fiat , turin has spent millions to retool itself into the world 's winter sports mecca for the next 17 days .
italian police and security personnel were everywhere friday and throughout the week , worried about terrorists and protestors who managed to force those carrying the olympic flame to divert from their planned route to the stadium .
about 15,000 police officers have been deployed and two nato surveillance planes will patrol the no-fly zone declared over turin during the opening ceremony .
german elected ioc vice president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach far from the snow and ice on friday , the international olympic committee elected german member thomas bach to be vice president , replacing the outgoing american ioc vp james easton . easton had hoped to gain a place on the executive board in the reshuffle .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .

as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .
31 . the carmaker said it would propose an increased dividend for 2005 , with ordinary shareholders to be paid 1.15 euros per share , up from 1.05 euros in 2004 .
preference shareholders would receive 1.21 euros per share , up from 1.11 euros a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de facing a changing industry , a city tries to reinvent itself wolfsburg is a planned city established around a volkswagen plant in 1938 and has thrived for decades .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .

since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically .

if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .

german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .

knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .

since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2006 in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the end of the road for the hotel unter den linden once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition . in the hotel unter den linden on berlin 's famed boulevard of the same name , everything seems like business as usual .
guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location .

the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "

russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 money problems hobble nato 's rapid response force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations are behind nato 's proposed rapid reaction force ; some , however , are not nato leaders agree that if the alliance is to survive the challenges of the 21st century , it must adapt .
its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .

france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : winter olympics in turin germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach many potential security threats as winter olympics kick off 2006 winter olympics open in turin europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 doping allegations tarnish olympics opening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doping cast a shadow over the olympics ?
the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 opinion : annan justified in criticism of media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan 's level-headed sentiments stated the obvious un secretary general kofi annan spoke out about the ongoing mohammed cartoons controversy , saying the media should not pour oil on the fire by reprinting the images .
his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .

but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

26 with the men 's ice hockey final and the men 's 50km cross country . international olympic committee president jacques rogge told athletes from around 80 countries gathered in the 35,000-capacity stadio olimpico that they were " role models " and that their " conduct will inspire and motivate future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the olympic stadium during the ceremony " our world today is in need of peace , tolerance and brotherhood , " rogge said .
" the values of the olympic games can deliver these to us .
may the games be held in peace , in the true spirit of the olympic truce . " the key moment , as with every olympics , was the conclusion of the parade of athletes into the stadium when , as michael payne , the former marketing director of the international olympic committee , said , viewers see " the fairy tale of the world brought together . " but the show both before and after the parade of athletes was filled with lights , fire , ice and more than a small taste of italy and the world .
while film stars sophia loren and susan sarandon joined bestselling author isabel allende in carrying the olympic flag into the stadium , john lennon 's widow yoko ono and singer peter gabriel performed " imagine . " icons such as operatic star luciano pavarotti and the ballet corps from milan 's famous teatro alla scala performed .
the alps , cows , inline skaters with flames shooting from their helmets , and a much-bigger-than-life ski jumper provided further highlights . firework lights torch the identity of the final flame-bearer , as always , remained a secret right up to the entrance of the flame into the stadium . gold medal skier alberto tomba was widely rumored to have the honor of lighting the olympic flame , but in the end , cross-country skier stefania belmondo , italy 's most decorated winter olympian , won the race . she lit the torch by igniting a massive firework that engulfed the entired stadium and climbed up to the stadium tower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belmondo as she indirectly lit the torch turin-born former top model carla bruni meanwhile carried the italian flag .
beyond turin 's auto manufacturing past , the city is still known as a fashion and design destination . once dominated by struggling car manufacturer fiat , turin has spent millions to retool itself into the world 's winter sports mecca for the next 17 days .
italian police and security personnel were everywhere friday and throughout the week , worried about terrorists and protestors who managed to force those carrying the olympic flame to divert from their planned route to the stadium .
about 15,000 police officers have been deployed and two nato surveillance planes will patrol the no-fly zone declared over turin during the opening ceremony .
german elected ioc vice president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach far from the snow and ice on friday , the international olympic committee elected german member thomas bach to be vice president , replacing the outgoing american ioc vp james easton . easton had hoped to gain a place on the executive board in the reshuffle .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 opinion : annan justified in criticism of media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan 's level-headed sentiments stated the obvious un secretary general kofi annan spoke out about the ongoing mohammed cartoons controversy , saying the media should not pour oil on the fire by reprinting the images .
his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .
mohammed cartoons likely protected by german law germany 's stance on holocaust denial has been targeted by some muslims in the current row over mohammed caricatures .
but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .

where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history .

the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive .

" having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 opinion : annan justified in criticism of media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan 's level-headed sentiments stated the obvious un secretary general kofi annan spoke out about the ongoing mohammed cartoons controversy , saying the media should not pour oil on the fire by reprinting the images .
his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .
mohammed cartoons likely protected by german law germany 's stance on holocaust denial has been targeted by some muslims in the current row over mohammed caricatures .
but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law .
-lrb- feb .
9 , 2006 -rrb- europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .
but it 's not the first time europe has a raging blasphemy controversy on its hands .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 opinion : annan justified in criticism of media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan 's level-headed sentiments stated the obvious un secretary general kofi annan spoke out about the ongoing mohammed cartoons controversy , saying the media should not pour oil on the fire by reprinting the images .
his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .

one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .

turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

" we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : winter olympics in turin many potential security threats as winter olympics kick off doping allegations tarnish olympics opening court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach 2006 winter olympics open in turin olympics -pipe- 10.02.2006 germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's olympic athletes hope to do it again in turin germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .
one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .
we 've had a truce for a while now . " turbo disl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uschi disl could tie bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history biathlon 's combination of cross-country skiing and marksmanship has been a perfect fit for uschi disl .
she has eight olympic and 15 world championship medals in the biathlon .
turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .
if disl wins four medals in turin , she would tie norwegian cross-country skier bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history -lrb- 12 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm already has two olympic gold medals and a silver teammate kati wilhelm , who sports neon red hair , is a favorite after winning two golds and a silver in 2002 . " four years ago , i was a ' no name ' and had no pressure , " said wilhelm , who will carry the german flag during the opening ceremony .
" now it will be a lot tougher . " for the men , ricco gross is expected to build on his seven total olympic medals , more than any other male biathlete . watch for these germa n s , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronny ackermann will threaten for gold in the nordic combined ronny ackermann is a favorite in the nordic combined competition , but probably not amongst his peers .
when he lost to hannu manninen of finland recently , ackermann swung his ski pole and hit manninen , who was celebrating by making a snow angel .
the two refused to shake hands on the medal podium .
but ackermann won the sprint and individual events at the world championships and helped germany to second in the team event . rene sommerfeldt and axel teichmann have taken the past two overall world cup titles in men 's cross-country skiing . martina ertl looks like a potential medalist in the mountains .
she 's won three medals in five separate winter games and competes this time in the combined and giant slalom ski competitions . and watch out for german athletes in women 's skeleton , men 's curling and men 's halfpipe snowboard competitions . a n d the medal cou n t ? not that germans really care , but ladbrokes , the british gambling concern , puts germany at even money to win the most gold medals , and 6-10 to win the most medals of any color in turin .
norway and the united states are not expected to be far behind . ladbrokes officials must certainly maintain , however , that the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why not an eu medal tally ?

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .

" we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .

" expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.02.2006 oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy-hungry countries are looking to secure their future needs finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets . it is the first meeting of the group - which includes germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states - since russia took over the rotating presidency for the first time ever at the beginning of the year . russia has set a diverse agenda for the meetings , and has invited emerging economic giants brazil , china , india and south africa to talks alongside the g8 discussion .
beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .

in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .
the president 's election promises to fight poverty and youth unemployment would be a lot harder to fulfill if he were to be denied that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german imports to iran to fall sharply due to nuclear standoff german exports to iran will fall sharply this year because of iran 's escalating nuclear standoff with the west and a purge of officials at iranian state firms and ministries , a top industry group says .

according to foreign ministry staff in berlin , rescue efforts continue unabated . staff from the foreign ministry 's crisis team have not yet been able to establish contact with either rene bräunlich , 31 , or thomas nitzschke , 28 , the two german engineers who 've been held captive in iraq since jan .
24 . appeals for their release have been coming from a variety of sources .
last week , the mothers of the two men appeared on television to call for " compassion and mercy " from the hostage-takers . the leipzig-based engineering firm cryotec , for whom the two men were working in iraq , also issued a video in which the company 's ceo , peter bienert , asked for contact to be established .
the video was aired by al-jazeera , but a cryotec spokeswoman told dpa news agency on thursday that they have not had news of any reactions from iraq . unusual support now , support is coming from an unusual source - the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , and the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
after consulting with crisis management staff at the german foreign ministry , the organizations appealed to the iraqi football association to mediate for the release of two hostages . the dfb said on thursday that its letter to their iraqi counterparts would stress their good relations and the support the dfb has given the iraqis in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich -lrb- left -rrb- und thomas nitzschke -lrb- right -rrb- were abducted over two weeks ago the dfb and the dfl also sent letters to the parents of the two engineers , expressing their solidarity .
one of the hostages , rene bräunlich , has played in the soccer league of his home city , leipzig , for years . for rene 's mother , the uncertainty surrounding her son will be even harder to bear on sunday .
" that 's rene 's birthday , " his mother told dpa .
" he 'll be 32 . " bräunlich and nitzschke were kidnapped by armed men in the northern iraqi city of baiji , where they were working on an oil refinery compound .
their abductors are demanding that the german government close the german embassy in baghdad , end all collaboration with the new iraqi government , and withdraw german companies operating in iraq . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no progress in german hostage crisis the german government has no news so far of two german hostages in iraq after a friday-night deadline set by their captors expired .

one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .
we 've had a truce for a while now . " turbo disl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uschi disl could tie bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history biathlon 's combination of cross-country skiing and marksmanship has been a perfect fit for uschi disl .
she has eight olympic and 15 world championship medals in the biathlon .
turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .
if disl wins four medals in turin , she would tie norwegian cross-country skier bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history -lrb- 12 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm already has two olympic gold medals and a silver teammate kati wilhelm , who sports neon red hair , is a favorite after winning two golds and a silver in 2002 . " four years ago , i was a ' no name ' and had no pressure , " said wilhelm , who will carry the german flag during the opening ceremony .

when he lost to hannu manninen of finland recently , ackermann swung his ski pole and hit manninen , who was celebrating by making a snow angel .
the two refused to shake hands on the medal podium .
but ackermann won the sprint and individual events at the world championships and helped germany to second in the team event . rene sommerfeldt and axel teichmann have taken the past two overall world cup titles in men 's cross-country skiing . martina ertl looks like a potential medalist in the mountains .
she 's won three medals in five separate winter games and competes this time in the combined and giant slalom ski competitions . and watch out for german athletes in women 's skeleton , men 's curling and men 's halfpipe snowboard competitions . a n d the medal cou n t ? not that germans really care , but ladbrokes , the british gambling concern , puts germany at even money to win the most gold medals , and 6-10 to win the most medals of any color in turin .
norway and the united states are not expected to be far behind . ladbrokes officials must certainly maintain , however , that the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why not an eu medal tally ?

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .

russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .

russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .

in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

according to foreign ministry staff in berlin , rescue efforts continue unabated . staff from the foreign ministry 's crisis team have not yet been able to establish contact with either rene bräunlich , 31 , or thomas nitzschke , 28 , the two german engineers who 've been held captive in iraq since jan .
24 . appeals for their release have been coming from a variety of sources .
last week , the mothers of the two men appeared on television to call for " compassion and mercy " from the hostage-takers . the leipzig-based engineering firm cryotec , for whom the two men were working in iraq , also issued a video in which the company 's ceo , peter bienert , asked for contact to be established .
the video was aired by al-jazeera , but a cryotec spokeswoman told dpa news agency on thursday that they have not had news of any reactions from iraq . unusual support now , support is coming from an unusual source - the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , and the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
after consulting with crisis management staff at the german foreign ministry , the organizations appealed to the iraqi football association to mediate for the release of two hostages . the dfb said on thursday that its letter to their iraqi counterparts would stress their good relations and the support the dfb has given the iraqis in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich -lrb- left -rrb- und thomas nitzschke -lrb- right -rrb- were abducted over two weeks ago the dfb and the dfl also sent letters to the parents of the two engineers , expressing their solidarity .
one of the hostages , rene bräunlich , has played in the soccer league of his home city , leipzig , for years . for rene 's mother , the uncertainty surrounding her son will be even harder to bear on sunday .
" that 's rene 's birthday , " his mother told dpa .
" he 'll be 32 . " bräunlich and nitzschke were kidnapped by armed men in the northern iraqi city of baiji , where they were working on an oil refinery compound .

his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures .

freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .

russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .

russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .

in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .
31 . the carmaker said it would propose an increased dividend for 2005 , with ordinary shareholders to be paid 1.15 euros per share , up from 1.05 euros in 2004 .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .

his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 money problems hobble nato 's rapid response force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations are behind nato 's proposed rapid reaction force ; some , however , are not nato leaders agree that if the alliance is to survive the challenges of the 21st century , it must adapt .
its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .
31 . the carmaker said it would propose an increased dividend for 2005 , with ordinary shareholders to be paid 1.15 euros per share , up from 1.05 euros in 2004 .

where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .
people are trying to muddle through , caught between different arguments from different interest groups , and the outcome may end up not satisfying anyone .

the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .

" everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .

" the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .

france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided .

" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .

" this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .

" expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .

" the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 opinion : annan justified in criticism of media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan 's level-headed sentiments stated the obvious un secretary general kofi annan spoke out about the ongoing mohammed cartoons controversy , saying the media should not pour oil on the fire by reprinting the images .
his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .

26 with the men 's ice hockey final and the men 's 50km cross country . international olympic committee president jacques rogge told athletes from around 80 countries gathered in the 35,000-capacity stadio olimpico that they were " role models " and that their " conduct will inspire and motivate future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the olympic stadium during the ceremony " our world today is in need of peace , tolerance and brotherhood , " rogge said .
" the values of the olympic games can deliver these to us .
may the games be held in peace , in the true spirit of the olympic truce . " the key moment , as with every olympics , was the conclusion of the parade of athletes into the stadium when , as michael payne , the former marketing director of the international olympic committee , said , viewers see " the fairy tale of the world brought together . " but the show both before and after the parade of athletes was filled with lights , fire , ice and more than a small taste of italy and the world .
while film stars sophia loren and susan sarandon joined bestselling author isabel allende in carrying the olympic flag into the stadium , john lennon 's widow yoko ono and singer peter gabriel performed " imagine . " icons such as operatic star luciano pavarotti and the ballet corps from milan 's famous teatro alla scala performed .
the alps , cows , inline skaters with flames shooting from their helmets , and a much-bigger-than-life ski jumper provided further highlights . firework lights torch the identity of the final flame-bearer , as always , remained a secret right up to the entrance of the flame into the stadium . gold medal skier alberto tomba was widely rumored to have the honor of lighting the olympic flame , but in the end , cross-country skier stefania belmondo , italy 's most decorated winter olympian , won the race . she lit the torch by igniting a massive firework that engulfed the entired stadium and climbed up to the stadium tower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belmondo as she indirectly lit the torch turin-born former top model carla bruni meanwhile carried the italian flag .
beyond turin 's auto manufacturing past , the city is still known as a fashion and design destination . once dominated by struggling car manufacturer fiat , turin has spent millions to retool itself into the world 's winter sports mecca for the next 17 days .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

his words were justified , says dw 's peter philipp . kofi annan deserves credit for his emphatic appeal to all sides in the cartoon controversy to come to their senses and to deescalate the situation rather than continue the cycle of denigration and violence . level-headed sentiments such as annan 's have become all too rare in a time when , in the throes of moral outrage - or what is taken to be moral outrage - people are being mobilized in what 's billed as the " clash of cultures . "
the violence spawned by the cartoons has already claimed its first victims , and in the west , resulted in the erection of any number of barricades for the supposed protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the press . stating the obvious annan did n't even say anything all that sensational - he simply stated the obvious , which is that there can be no understanding for european media that reprint the cartoons and thus pour oil on the fire .
freedom of the press does not grant the media carte blanche , rather it should be used with a sense of responsibility and judgment .
at the same time , though , violence is not an acceptable answer , especially when it 's directed at innocent people who had nothing to do with the publication of the cartoons . to prevent such things from happening in the future , it 's absolutely necessary to review the question of human rights , and to clarify what priority should be accorded to press freedom on the one hand , and religious freedom on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan told western media to stop pouring oil on the fire still , conventions and laws alone wo n't be enough to stop such incidents from repeating themselves .
that requires a little bit of common sense , and a lot of humanity .
these qualities could have prevented the initial publishing of the cartoons in denmark , and on the muslim side , they also should have lead to the incident being dismissed as the tactless lapse of a newspaper , and not the signal to wage a war of civilizations . defending an explosive freedom annan was right to criticize the further publication of the cartoons in other newspapers .
the decision to do so could be defended by arguing that it 's necessary to show readers what the fight is all about .
instead , most media have held up their publication of the cartoons as a way of defending the freedom of the press - even though by now , every idiot should know how explosive this is . admittedly , it seems a bit odd when all the tv talk shows limit themselves to describing the caricatures in words .
but by now , anyone who 's truly interested in the debate is aware of what it 's about or has found the cartoons on the internet or elsewhere . anyone who would now persist in publishing the controversial cartoons must also be willing to stand accused of wanton arson .
kofi annan could not have been more to the point in his condemnation of such action . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier of stories about the cartoon controversy .
mohammed cartoons likely protected by german law germany 's stance on holocaust denial has been targeted by some muslims in the current row over mohammed caricatures .
but experts said the pictures - unlike holocaust denial - are likely protected under german law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : winter olympics in turin many potential security threats as winter olympics kick off doping allegations tarnish olympics opening court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach 2006 winter olympics open in turin olympics -pipe- 10.02.2006 germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's olympic athletes hope to do it again in turin germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .
one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .
we 've had a truce for a while now . " turbo disl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uschi disl could tie bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history biathlon 's combination of cross-country skiing and marksmanship has been a perfect fit for uschi disl .
she has eight olympic and 15 world championship medals in the biathlon .
turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .
if disl wins four medals in turin , she would tie norwegian cross-country skier bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history -lrb- 12 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm already has two olympic gold medals and a silver teammate kati wilhelm , who sports neon red hair , is a favorite after winning two golds and a silver in 2002 . " four years ago , i was a ' no name ' and had no pressure , " said wilhelm , who will carry the german flag during the opening ceremony .
" now it will be a lot tougher . " for the men , ricco gross is expected to build on his seven total olympic medals , more than any other male biathlete . watch for these germa n s , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronny ackermann will threaten for gold in the nordic combined ronny ackermann is a favorite in the nordic combined competition , but probably not amongst his peers .
when he lost to hannu manninen of finland recently , ackermann swung his ski pole and hit manninen , who was celebrating by making a snow angel .
the two refused to shake hands on the medal podium .
but ackermann won the sprint and individual events at the world championships and helped germany to second in the team event . rene sommerfeldt and axel teichmann have taken the past two overall world cup titles in men 's cross-country skiing . martina ertl looks like a potential medalist in the mountains .
she 's won three medals in five separate winter games and competes this time in the combined and giant slalom ski competitions . and watch out for german athletes in women 's skeleton , men 's curling and men 's halfpipe snowboard competitions . a n d the medal cou n t ? not that germans really care , but ladbrokes , the british gambling concern , puts germany at even money to win the most gold medals , and 6-10 to win the most medals of any color in turin .
norway and the united states are not expected to be far behind . ladbrokes officials must certainly maintain , however , that the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why not an eu medal tally ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 money problems hobble nato 's rapid response force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nations are behind nato 's proposed rapid reaction force ; some , however , are not nato leaders agree that if the alliance is to survive the challenges of the 21st century , it must adapt .
its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .

it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .
the president 's election promises to fight poverty and youth unemployment would be a lot harder to fulfill if he were to be denied that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german imports to iran to fall sharply due to nuclear standoff german exports to iran will fall sharply this year because of iran 's escalating nuclear standoff with the west and a purge of officials at iranian state firms and ministries , a top industry group says .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .
31 . the carmaker said it would propose an increased dividend for 2005 , with ordinary shareholders to be paid 1.15 euros per share , up from 1.05 euros in 2004 .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .
the president 's election promises to fight poverty and youth unemployment would be a lot harder to fulfill if he were to be denied that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german imports to iran to fall sharply due to nuclear standoff german exports to iran will fall sharply this year because of iran 's escalating nuclear standoff with the west and a purge of officials at iranian state firms and ministries , a top industry group says .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .
31 . the carmaker said it would propose an increased dividend for 2005 , with ordinary shareholders to be paid 1.15 euros per share , up from 1.05 euros in 2004 .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .

russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .

russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries .

the alps , cows , inline skaters with flames shooting from their helmets , and a much-bigger-than-life ski jumper provided further highlights . firework lights torch the identity of the final flame-bearer , as always , remained a secret right up to the entrance of the flame into the stadium . gold medal skier alberto tomba was widely rumored to have the honor of lighting the olympic flame , but in the end , cross-country skier stefania belmondo , italy 's most decorated winter olympian , won the race . she lit the torch by igniting a massive firework that engulfed the entired stadium and climbed up to the stadium tower . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belmondo as she indirectly lit the torch turin-born former top model carla bruni meanwhile carried the italian flag .

italian police and security personnel were everywhere friday and throughout the week , worried about terrorists and protestors who managed to force those carrying the olympic flame to divert from their planned route to the stadium .
about 15,000 police officers have been deployed and two nato surveillance planes will patrol the no-fly zone declared over turin during the opening ceremony .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .

one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath .

luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .

she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .

lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .

one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .
we 've had a truce for a while now . " turbo disl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uschi disl could tie bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history biathlon 's combination of cross-country skiing and marksmanship has been a perfect fit for uschi disl .
she has eight olympic and 15 world championship medals in the biathlon .
turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .
if disl wins four medals in turin , she would tie norwegian cross-country skier bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history -lrb- 12 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm already has two olympic gold medals and a silver teammate kati wilhelm , who sports neon red hair , is a favorite after winning two golds and a silver in 2002 . " four years ago , i was a ' no name ' and had no pressure , " said wilhelm , who will carry the german flag during the opening ceremony .
" now it will be a lot tougher . " for the men , ricco gross is expected to build on his seven total olympic medals , more than any other male biathlete . watch for these germa n s , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronny ackermann will threaten for gold in the nordic combined ronny ackermann is a favorite in the nordic combined competition , but probably not amongst his peers .
when he lost to hannu manninen of finland recently , ackermann swung his ski pole and hit manninen , who was celebrating by making a snow angel .
the two refused to shake hands on the medal podium .
but ackermann won the sprint and individual events at the world championships and helped germany to second in the team event . rene sommerfeldt and axel teichmann have taken the past two overall world cup titles in men 's cross-country skiing . martina ertl looks like a potential medalist in the mountains .
she 's won three medals in five separate winter games and competes this time in the combined and giant slalom ski competitions . and watch out for german athletes in women 's skeleton , men 's curling and men 's halfpipe snowboard competitions . a n d the medal cou n t ? not that germans really care , but ladbrokes , the british gambling concern , puts germany at even money to win the most gold medals , and 6-10 to win the most medals of any color in turin .
norway and the united states are not expected to be far behind . ladbrokes officials must certainly maintain , however , that the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why not an eu medal tally ?
athletes are no longer divided into eastern and western europe - they are all members of the eu .
though they now compete under national flags , if they were taken as a bloc , the eu athletes would top the medal list .

3 , 2004 -rrb- germans need a new hannawald as german athletes fail to capture world titles in key winter sports like the four hills tournament , downhill skiing and nordic events this season , many are beginning to yearn for past glory days .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .
the defensive alliance looks at the 21st century stretching before it and sees many new challenges and threats ahead .
its original mandate and structure seems cumbersome when faced with diverse areas of deployment ranging from peace-keeping to disaster relief , international security to war fighting . in a bid to meet the challenges head on , nato leaders are urging the alliance to adapt and expand .
and with the introduction of the new nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- this year , the alliance looked set to modernize and become an armed organization ready to deploy in peaceful and conflict situations in a fraction of the time . the plan was vital to us-backed efforts to transform the 57-year-old alliance from its former role as cold war protector of europe into an organization able to launch missions ranging from aid delivery to hard combat at a few days ' notice . financing problems put nrf on hold after talks in italy however , despite nato defence ministers reiterating on friday their intention to get the rapid reaction force fully up and running by october , they did not agree on how to pay for it . " everyone is agreed we have to roll up our sleeves so as to set up this rapid reaction force on time , " a diplomat said on the sidelines of a meeting of alliance defense ministers in southern italy . but there are still gaps to be filled and all of the alliance 's 26 member countries have yet to say whether they will contribute . however , diplomats said nato defence ministers on friday had put off until a leaders ' meeting in riga in november a decision on how to reform the alliance 's funding to pay for the mission . the force would be made up of soldiers from nato members changing on a six-month rotating basis .
the countries providing troops at that time would be required to also pay for any missions the force would undertake . bill for earthquake mission lands on spain 's doormat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill for nato 's pakistan aid mission was handed to spain in the trial run during the pakistan earthquake disaster in january , the bill landed on spain 's doormat - one of the countries providing troops during that window - and the spanish government was required to stump up the 16 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- to cover the costs of the operation . unsurprisingly , spain has led the calls for the nrf 's costs to be financed out of shared nato funds , a notion rejected by britain and france who are wary of the principle of more common funding within nato , arguing it could deter nations from investing in their own national forces . financing is just one of the problems facing the nrf . the task force is also currently short of troops , with only 17,000 of the requested 25,000 soldiers put forward by nato members . rumsfeld angry at lack of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld wants more troops us defense secretary donald rumsfeld - who first proposed the nrf in 2002 - is known to be frustrated by the lack of commitment and is expected to push nato allies to contribute more in the near future . nato 's commander in europe , us general james jones admitted himself that the october launch of the nrf was in doubt . " the reason i 'm not confident is it is n't resourced now , " jones said , when asked this week if he was confident that the nrf would be fully operational by october .
" as things stand now , i ca n't say that , missing 25 percent of a force , that i have a great deal of confidence that we 're going to generate 25 percent as if by magic .
i 'm hoping to get there . " the lack of enthusiasm for the project , especially in some european quarters , can be traced back to the european union 's proposed military force . europe 's defe n se pla n s clash with those of nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's military plans conflict with those of nato europe 's ideas of forging a security and defense policy that could supplement some of nato 's tasks has been a sticking point between some eu members and the united states for some time .
france , for example , favors making the european union ever stronger in defense matters , part of a grander strategy of providing a counterweight to the united states in the world . supporters of the idea are stalling on committing to the nrf as the force may weaken attempts to set-up an eu equivalent in the future . german secretary of defense franz-josef jung is one of those who remain undecided . " we must consider in future the european union and the european battle groups , " he said .
" the application -lrb- for the nrf -rrb- must be discussed over and over again . " the soldiers of the nrf , when and if it is launched , are likely to be nato 's core task force .
the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .
" the tools at its disposal will allow nato to take charge of a whole range of operations , from humanitarian operations , such as the earthquake in pakistan , to conflict situations . " expensive logistical problems to be eased bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlifting nato troops into situations has proved both complicated and expensive one of the problems that nato troops have experienced in the past , which became painfully obvious once more during the relief efforts in the earthquake zone , was the lack of its own aircraft .
nato has few planes , meaning troops and equipment are usually airlifted into situations by rented aircraft , an expensive and sometimes complicated state of affairs .
meager european defense budgets have often been cited as the reason behind nato 's dearth of aircraft . six mo n th rotatio n of military respo n sibility alliance officials , however , hope the rotational nature of the nrf will help to put this problem right and allow the task force to live up to its billing as a rapid deployment army . the nrf will not be a standing army but one made up of troops from national forces .
each nato member will make soldiers available for call-up on a six-month rotating schedule backed by their own equipment and logistical apparatus .
they will be stationed and will train together at their home barracks for that six-month period awaiting orders for deployment . the nrf 's first major maneuvers in the atlantic island group of cape verde this june will go ahead , nato officials announced this week , but the scale of the exercise would be reduced . " we 've down-scaled the operation in terms of some of the manpower , which is really what costs a lot of money , " jones said .
he added that some 6,000 troops would take part instead of a planned 8,000 , insisting it would still be a valid test . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

its nrf rapid response force is part of that future but financing it has proved to be a major sticking point . transformation appears to be the buzzword at nato headquarters these days .

the force will be ready for deployment anywhere in the world within five days of receiving their mission and will be self-supporting for up to 30 days once on the ground , according to general jones . " this is will be a highly technological army and also a very adaptable one , " according to belgian lieutenant colonel ludwig decamps at nato headquarters in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : winter olympics in turin germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach many potential security threats as winter olympics kick off 2006 winter olympics open in turin europe -pipe- 10.02.2006 doping allegations tarnish olympics opening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will doping cast a shadow over the olympics ?
the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

the shadow of previous doping scandals hangs over the opening of the winter olympics in turin friday after eight athletes were given suspensions to clear up questionable test results . as athletes and officials were preparing for the inaugural ceremony launching two weeks of olympics , the ugly specter of doping threatened to tarnish all the winter glamour .
just as with the summer olympics in athens and the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , doping accusations stole the spotlight . according to an italian official , several athletes have tested positive for doping in pre-games drug checks .
the international olympic committee , however , has rejected the statement . questionable findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympic village in turin giovanni zotta , a representative on the ioc 's anti-doping commission , said preliminary tests on 98 athletes found the banned substance erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- in several athletes . " so far there have been cases of ep in several athletes , but it must be confirmed , " zotto told reuters .
he declined to give any names and said subsequent tests were required to confirm initial results . the ioc dismissed zotto 's claim . " this information is incorrect , " it said friday . epo , which boosts the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen , helps improve muscle stamina .
it is used particularly by athletes in endurance sports .
in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

one betting firm reckons they just might do it again in 2006 . germans , with their inclination to avoid outward displays of nationalism , probably were n't even keeping track of the medal count during the 2002 winter olympic games . but their countrymen did , in fact , win 36 medals - two more than the us team .
this year , they are again one of the favorites , along with norway and the united states , to win the mythical title in turin , italy . the pressure to win medals , of course , runs counter to an important tenet of the olympic oath . " the important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle , " it goes . be that as it may , there 's a few germans to watch out for in the next couple of weeks . the everyma n luger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackl is regarded as a superb driver start with the guy who germans have been watching for a very long time .
luger georg hackl made history in the 1998 games in nagano , japan , when he became the fifth winter olympian to win an individual event at three consecutive games .
in salt lake city , hackl won silver and became the first olympic athlete -lrb- winter or summer -rrb- to earn an individual medal at five consecutive games -lrb- he also won silver in 1988 -rrb- . guess what ?
hackl 's back .
at age 39 , he may not look the part of a gold medal contender .
he 's carrying 175 pounds -lrb- 80 kilograms -rrb- on his 5 foot 8 inch -lrb- 172 centimeters -rrb- frame . he does like his wheat beer . " most of the time , i train alone because other members of the team are so much younger , " he said .
" the training schedule makes sense with young people , but it doesn ’ t make sense for people with more than 20 years experience . " hackl 's strong finishes in international competition since 2002 put him right back into medal contention in 2006 barring a crash - or a burst seam in his wind shearing suit . the n ext ge n eratio n hackl will be challenged , however , by david möller , who leads germany 's next generation of lugers .
möller won a gold medal at the 2004 world championships and a bronze in 2005 . germany 's women lugers have gone 1-2-3 at every major event since 1999 and many believe they will keep that streak alive in turin .
the luge doubles also could bring gold to germany for both men and women .
in total , the german luge team could bring home seven medals on its own . on the bobsled track , andre lange leads the defending olympic four-man gold medal team , though there has not been a repeat winner in the event since 1980 .
lange switched to bobsled from the luge more than a decade ago . " i worked very hard , but i did n't expect to have the speed come so fast , " he said . lange is a four-time world champion piloting the four-man sled , and three-time overall world cup champion .
but in the 2005-06 season , he placed out of the medals in both two-man and four-man competitions behind his teammate matthias hoepfner , a definite medal contender . salt lake city silver medalist sandra kiriasis took gold last year in the women 's world championships and is germany 's top challenger for the women . is the girls ' fight over ? turin 's oval lingotto speed-skating surface will prove a battle ground for two of germany 's best known athletes , both of whom now claim their heated rivalry is a thing of the past .
anni friesinger and claudia pechstein each won gold at the 2002 games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger -lrb- right -rrb- and former rival claudia pechstein the german media hitched up to their confrontations starting with a race just before the salt lake city games in which pechstein announced she was ill .
she then proceeded to blow the competition away , including friesinger , in the 5,000 meter event , prompting friesinger to angrily tell german television , " well , she ca n't have been that sick , can she ? " the remark added a spark to viewer interest in the 2002 games .
the two women even accused each other of underhanded tactics to disrupt each other 's preparations .
it all became a tabloid editor 's dream as newspapers dubbed the rivalry , das zickenduell , or girls ' fight .
both athletes , however , have rather pleasant exteriors and both have allowed themselves to be photographed extensively in various degrees of dress , adding further to the tabloid interest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friesinger 's favored to win gold again friesinger is a favorite in the 1,500m , and possibly the 1,000m and 3,000m .
she will also race in the 5,000m and a new event , team pursuit .
her toughest challenge in the 3,000m and 5,000m may come from pechstein , a four-time olympic champion . " everyone says i could win four gold medals , " friesinger recently told a gathering of german media .
" but my dream would be one gold medal and it does n't matter in which event .
there must be at least one olympic gold medal in there somewhere .
whatever else comes on top i 'll happily take . " germans are divided on just whom to support .
most are either " anni fans " or on " claudi 's side . "
lately , the women have mended their most serious differences .
they now play on their rivalry in an advertisement for a travel agency . " we 're never going to become close friends , " friesinger said .
" but we respect each other .
our relationship is normal now .
there are n't any problems any more .
we 've had a truce for a while now . " turbo disl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uschi disl could tie bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history biathlon 's combination of cross-country skiing and marksmanship has been a perfect fit for uschi disl .
she has eight olympic and 15 world championship medals in the biathlon .
turin is her fifth and final winter games . in 2005 , " turbo disl " was named germany 's sportswoman of the year in a moving ceremony in which her brother , who recently faced a critical illness , presented the award . there 's little wonder why germans see a steady stream of biathlon events on television .
germany 's women and men far and away lead those countries currently competing in biathlon with 27 total medals , followed by norway 's 17 . in salt lake city , germany won nine biathlon medals .
if disl wins four medals in turin , she would tie norwegian cross-country skier bjorn daehlie for the most medals in winter games history -lrb- 12 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm already has two olympic gold medals and a silver teammate kati wilhelm , who sports neon red hair , is a favorite after winning two golds and a silver in 2002 . " four years ago , i was a ' no name ' and had no pressure , " said wilhelm , who will carry the german flag during the opening ceremony .

" for the men , ricco gross is expected to build on his seven total olympic medals , more than any other male biathlete . watch for these germa n s , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronny ackermann will threaten for gold in the nordic combined ronny ackermann is a favorite in the nordic combined competition , but probably not amongst his peers .
when he lost to hannu manninen of finland recently , ackermann swung his ski pole and hit manninen , who was celebrating by making a snow angel .
the two refused to shake hands on the medal podium .
but ackermann won the sprint and individual events at the world championships and helped germany to second in the team event . rene sommerfeldt and axel teichmann have taken the past two overall world cup titles in men 's cross-country skiing . martina ertl looks like a potential medalist in the mountains .
she 's won three medals in five separate winter games and competes this time in the combined and giant slalom ski competitions . and watch out for german athletes in women 's skeleton , men 's curling and men 's halfpipe snowboard competitions . a n d the medal cou n t ? not that germans really care , but ladbrokes , the british gambling concern , puts germany at even money to win the most gold medals , and 6-10 to win the most medals of any color in turin .
norway and the united states are not expected to be far behind . ladbrokes officials must certainly maintain , however , that the important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why not an eu medal tally ?

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .
the president 's election promises to fight poverty and youth unemployment would be a lot harder to fulfill if he were to be denied that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german imports to iran to fall sharply due to nuclear standoff german exports to iran will fall sharply this year because of iran 's escalating nuclear standoff with the west and a purge of officials at iranian state firms and ministries , a top industry group says .

in previous olympics , several athletes have been banned from competition after traces of epo were detected . skiers suspended in an apparent separate development , eight nordic skiers , including german olympic gold medalist evi sachenbacher , were suspended for five days after tests showed they had an abnormally high red blood cell count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slopes are ready for the olympics the cross country skiers – three women and five men – were found to have hemoglobin values that were " too high " in pre-competition blood testing , the international skiing federation -lrb- fis -rrb- announced late thursday .
as a result , the officials decided to bar the skiers from the starting line-up for five days , effectively excluding them from the first races on sunday , the women 's 15km and the men 's 30km . officials were careful to formulate their words on friday , saying the ban was a health measure , and not a doping-related sanction . " the prohibition from participating in the competitions is not a sanction , but is considered to serve to protect the health of the athlete , " said sarah lewis , secretary general of the fis , which conducted the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evi sachenbacher on friday sachenbacher said she was disappointed and did n't understand why she was n't allowed to race on sunday . " i never did anything wrong , " she told journalists . german ski federation doctor ernst jakob protested the decision . " we ca n't accept that athletes are being banned due to slightly higher blood cell counts , using the excuse of health concerns , " he said , adding that sachenbacher had a naturally higher count of red blood cells and should not have been banned . " hemoglobin levels can be affected by altitude training or the use of agents to boost hemoglobin , " such as epo lewis said and acknowledged that in some instances athletes may naturally have blood cell counts that exceed specified limits .
if that is the case , they need to present a certificate and be checked by an fis-appointed specialist , she said . criminal punishment ? further blood and urine tests will be carried out by the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- .
under the ioc rulebook , athletes are allowed to return to competition after their five-day suspension , subject to the results of a new blood test . italian officials will be watching the outcome of doping tests very closely .
whereas the ioc has said it does not yet foresee tough sanctions , italy has tough anti-doping laws that call for criminal proceedings and possible prison sentences . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics germany surpassed expectations with an impressive showing in the 2002 winter olympic games in utah .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .
the president 's election promises to fight poverty and youth unemployment would be a lot harder to fulfill if he were to be denied that . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german imports to iran to fall sharply due to nuclear standoff german exports to iran will fall sharply this year because of iran 's escalating nuclear standoff with the west and a purge of officials at iranian state firms and ministries , a top industry group says .

guests speaking a multitude of languages lounge in the lobby 's comfy yellow chairs , and the doorman in his gold-buttoned jacket is kept busy by a steady flow of people . but the plaza outside the hotel looks curiously empty .
where once a gaggle of trees sprouted from the paving stones , now there are just freshly shorn stumps - a sign of the fate awaiting the concrete block hotel that was built under the former east german government , and once housed prominent guests of the regime . berlin 's senator for city development , ingeborg junge-reyer , announced demolition plans for the hotel unter den linden last week .
the munich-based asset management firm meag , in collaboration with the prominent german architectural firm gerkan , marg and partners -lrb- gmp -rrb- , is planning to build an eight-storey complex with office , retail , and residential space on the site . " berlin is always changing , it 's interesting , " junge-reyer said . but this particular change is moving ahead at breakneck speed , in part because of pressure to have the historic boulevard in presentable shape by june , when germany hosts the world cup soccer tournament . demolition of the hotel is due to begin on march 1 and to be completed by mid-may .
during the world cup , the city plans to erect a giant screen on the empty lot at the corner of unter den linden and tony friedrichstrasse , where crowds of spectators can follow the matches . the schedule means that the hotel unter den linden will have to close its doors by the end of february - something that has saddened its staff as well as many tourists .
in gdr times , the hotel was a chic and somewhat expensive choice , but in recent years , it became a popular choice with students , seniors , tour groups and families , who appreciated the availability of rooms starting at 57 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- in such a central location . " our guests are really sorry that the hotel is being torn down , " one of the receptionists said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse is now home to upscale stores like the galeries lafayette and in an online forum about the demolition , one former guest complained that she and others like her unable to pay upwards of 150 euros a night for a hotel would no longer be welcome in the area , now burgeoning with luxury shops and flashy auto showrooms . another forum user commented that the plans are just another example of how " the germans have little tact when dealing with their history . " " everything that comes from the east and was n't already around during the kaiser wilhelm era is being torn down , " wrote mark h. palace of the republic soo n to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days are numbered for berlin 's palace of the republic the hotel will hardly be the first east german building to give way to the wrecking ball .
the most prominent example is the former seat of the east german government , the palace of the republic .
after a heated debate lasting more than a decade , its demolition is due to begin this month . the discussion about the fate of the palace polarized berliners and prompted a wider debate about how the city should deal with the architectural reminders of its varied , often tragic , past . those in favor of tearing down the palace and other communist-era constructions , argue that the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime and are unworthy of the pride of place they currently enjoy in central berlin .
the city would do well , they say , to get rid of these " eyesores " if it 's serious about becoming a european capital on a par with london or paris . but those on the other side of the debate say it 's precisely because of what the buildings represent that they should be retained . hope harrison , expert on european affairs at george washington university and author of " driving the soviets up the wall , " a book dealing with the soviet and east german decision to build the berlin wall , said it 's important for public officials dealing with such issues to be more sensitive . " it 's still living history , " harrison said .
" there are a good number of people still alive today who were east germans .
it 's too narrow to say that because the buildings are symbols of a repressive regime , they should be torn down . " politicizi n g history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx allee in berlin has many examples of communist-era architecture harrison was once a guest in one of the hotel 's small , soviet-style rooms , and said that while it would be hard to argue on the basis of comfort that the hotel should stay , " you certainly felt like you were touching history by sleeping there , and not all hotels can offer that . " having spent time in berlin as a research fellow at the freie university , harrison is hopeful that the city will find a way to modernize itself , while retaining the traces of its history that are such a draw , especially for foreign tourists .
but she added that the city seems unable to resist politicizing its recent history when making planning decisions . " there 's been some effort to get this issue outside the political process and look at it from a long-range perspective , " harrison said .
" but communism is politicized more so than other recent history .

up to 20,000 employees at german car giant volkswagen feared for their jobs friday as the car maker unveiled deep restructuring plans , even though profits soared last year . " in order to boost the wholly unsatisfactory level of profitability of the vw passenger car brand , an extensive restructuring program has been drawn up , " europe 's biggest car maker said .
" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .

" in the next three years , up to 20,000 direct and indirect employees could be affected by this restructuring program . " vw declined to specify exactly how the employees might be affected or say if or how many jobs might be on the line as part of the shake-up . but newspaper reports suggested that the restructuring would entail the sale of components plants , which would automatically reduce the group 's headcount . given the " extremely tense economic situation , earnings of the vw brand were only just above breakeven , " vw explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder " in particular , the export capability of the german vw plants is not ensured , " said ceo bernd pischetsrieder .
" we continue to incur significant losses on cars exported from germany to the us .
in order to ensure a secure long term future for the group , we must act rapidly and determinedly to eliminate the problems that we face . " vw said the measures would include " elimination of productivity deficits , particularly in the car assembly plant . " making labor costs " more competitive " the components manufacturing business would be " reorganized " , labor costs made " more competitive " and capacity utilization boosted , it said . unions were angered by the company 's refusal to put forward any concrete figures for the possible job losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw workers during a warning strike at the company 's headquarters in 2004 the restructuring program " raises more questions than it answers , " said the regional branch of the powerful ig metall union in lower saxony , where vw is based . ig metall recognized the need to boost efficiency and optimize production , but insisted that job guarantees made under a collective agreement in november 2004 should be stuck to . under that agreement , management had pledged to guarantee around 100,000 jobs at the car maker 's german plants until 2011 . honoring previous deals pischetsrieder insisted that management board stood by that deal . nevertheless , the car maker was finding it difficult to ensure the competitiveness of the group and its employees under current conditions and hoped it could hammer out a new deal with unions and employee representatives .
vw 's works council said " have had enough of all the weeping and wailing about difficult the situation is . " what was needed was a clear , level-headed strategy " not hectic actionism that will repeat past errors , " it said in a statement , roundly slamming speculation about the possible sale or closure of plants . necessary measures ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are vws not selling fast enough ?
the vda auto industry federation insisted that while the belt-tightening measures at vw were certainly " painful , " they were " necessary " in view of fierce competition from low-cost countries . the german auto industry " may be hard to be hard to beat in terms of products , technologies and know-how .
but in terms of costs , working time and flexibility , it 's a different matter , " said vda chief bernd gottschalk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors liked what they saw for their part , investors were enthusiastic about the prospect of a radical shake-up and vw shares surged 4.45 euros or 8.8 percent to an intraday high of 55.07 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange . vw also published preliminary 2005 results , which showed that previous cost-cutting measures had helped boost profits last year . bottom-line net profit jumped by 61.5 percent to 1.12 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- and operating profit before special items soared by 54.3 percent to 3.143 billion euros on a 7.1-percent rise in sales to 95.268 billion euros . vw sold a total 5.243 million vehicles worldwide last year , 3.2 percent more than in 2004 .
the workforce totalled 344,902 as of dec .
31 . the carmaker said it would propose an increased dividend for 2005 , with ordinary shareholders to be paid 1.15 euros per share , up from 1.05 euros in 2004 .

beyond energy issues , the kremlin expects to confer on world trade , debt relief for poor countries , fighting infectious diseases and the financing of terror groups .
" at this stage of the dialogue russia has shown itself as a country that can set the priorities , " russian finance minister aleksey kudrin said on the program " good morning , russia " on friday .
" russia today is not the country that is just looking for help , " he added .
" russia itself can provide help and organize international discussion on these issues . "
keepi n g the lights o n , a n d the heat tur n ed up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries worry the flow of russian energy through a ukrainian pipeline could be disrupted again chief among the issues to be discussed by the ministers is " global energy security , " the topic that russia , a fast-growing world energy giant , has singled out as the top agenda item for its year-long g8 presidency .
russia made clear last year it would use the g8 discussion process to promote itself as a dependable energy partner with seemingly inexhaustible supply for world markets spooked by high prices and middle east volatility .
what moscow may not have foreseen was the cascade of consequences from an ugly dispute with ukraine on pricing for russian gas supplies that marked the start of its g8 presidency early this year . that dispute resulted in supply disruption to clients like germany and italy further downstream in europe .
coupled with moscow 's reassertion of state control over energy resources , the clash is raising western concern over its dependence on moscow for vital fuel and kremlin linkage of energy to politics . that concern will be aired at this weekend 's g8 finance minister 's meeting where , according to the fi n a n cial times , france and others intend to offer moscow financial incentives to liberalize its gas industry . russia holds e n ergy cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow-based gazprom has extended its energy monopoly in russia and parts of the former soviet union political crises in several key energy players beside the ukraine - including iran , nigeria and venezuela - have helped push crude oil prices toward record levels in turn threatening the health of the world economy .
russia 's role as the second largest producer of oil in the world makes it a powerful player in global energy trading . that 's why analysts expect that russia will hold its ground on energy issues at the g8 meeting , including those related to its state-controlled energy company gazprom .
the fi n a n cial times quoted an unnamed " western energy diplomat " saying it is " wishful thinking " to believe moscow will let gazprom reduce its monopoly hold on the russian pipeline system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 ministers figure disruptions in energy flow can produce major impact on the world economy in a thursday news conference , russian finance minister kudrin said energy discussion was not only about the secure and steady supply of oil and gas but about " establishing clear rules of the game " for energy markets . last september , the g8 pushed an eight-point plan to make the oil markets more transparent and , through energy conservation and the development of renewable sources , less able to disrupt the world economy .
in moscow , finance ministers are expected to push world bank president paul wolfowitz , who will also be attending , to move ahead with the creation of a new framework for channeling public and private money to renewable energy projects in developing countries . " measures will certainly be discussed to reduce the impact on these -lrb- developing -rrb- countries , which often relatively low efficiency in energy use , " said one german finance ministry official . di n n er , the opera , lu n ch with the preside n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will host the g8 heads of state later this year in saint petersburg prior to the main g8 finance ministers ' meetings on saturday , russian finance minister kudrin was slated to hold unofficial talks with his counterparts , including discussions with us treasury secretary john w. snow on russia 's bid to join the world trade organization .
in the evening ministers were to gather for dinner followed by an opera performance . the gathering is slated to kick-off officially with a dinner friday evening , and conclude with a lunch hosted by russian president vladimir putin , who will himself preside over a gathering by the g8 heads of states at their annual summit in july in saint petersburg . dw staff -lrb- km -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate best energy mix for the future rising prices for oil , natural gas and electricity have sparked a new discussion about the best energy mix in germany .

germany has the added worry of being involved in another serious dispute with main regional partner iran . escalating tensions in the middle east over the mohammed caricatures , the west 's nuclear stand-off with iran and the election success of hamas militants in the recent palestinian elections are having an adverse effect on european trade in the region . since the row over cartoons of the prophet mohammed surfaced over a week ago , a boycott of goods from a number of european nations has been gaining ground across the muslim world . in the first flush of anger , danish products were the first to be banned as a response to the images of which first appeared in the danish daily jylla n ds-poste n last year .
in the days that followed , the images were reprinted in a dozen publications across europe sparking further boycotts of goods from norway , france , italy and britain . as the conflict continues , germany now finds itself in the firing line as one of those countries involved in both the mohammed dispute and the iranian nuclear stand-off . one of the most important western trading partners in the middle east , specifically in iran , germany has a lot to lose economically if relations between islamic nations and the west deteriorate further .
german businesses are already nervous and some predict that even if the areas of conflict are resolved , trade relations may be severely damaged . the importance of western trade with iran has not been lost on the iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
as the threat of economic sanctions hangs over the islamic republic due to its decision to restart its controversial atomic research program , ahmadinejad is considering a counter-strike against those involved in pushing for those sanctions . ira n ia n preside n t har n essi n g mohammed a n ger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahamdinejad may implement his own sanctions channeling the anger stirred by the mohammed cartoons , the iranian president aims to garner support from his islamic neighbors by instigating his own trade embargos with the west . denmark , as the main culprit in the cartoon row , is the first to suffer .
iran stopped the import of danish goods on tuesday .
the harsh words coming out of tehran aimed at the german administration may precede similar action towards germany .
for a country which has worked long and hard to develop such strong commercial relations with iran and the middle east as a whole , such a development is worrying . " iran is germany 's most important trading partner in the region , " said jens nagel , an expert at the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade , in an interview with the business weekly ma n ager magazin .
only the united arab emirates carries more weight in business in iran than germany . germany 's reputation in the region has been built on the quality of products and the good business relationships it has built up over years , something that is highly prized in arab countries . germa n i n dustry to take a hit if ira n cou n ters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metal producers provides the raw material for iran 's automotive industry german businesses exported goods and services to iran last year to the tune of about 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.38 billion -rrb- , and did business worth about 450 million euros with both syria and lebanon .
the main areas of trade have traditionally been chemical and industrial products and machinery .
it is the metal industry in particular that could be most at risk if iran were to retaliate to united nations sanction by hitting back at its western trade partners . " germany would be the western industrial nation to suffer most if economic sanctions went against iran , " nagel said .
" german businesses deliver far more to the region than possibly great britain , france or italy . " he added that the united states would not feel any effects as they had broken off economic relations years ago . experts consider the economic fallout from the mohammed caricature row to be a lot lower risk for germany .
knee-jerk boycotts and short embargoes would not necessarily affect german trade to any significant degree in the middle east .
if and when the climate cools , analysts believe it will be " business as usual " for german companies doing business in the region .
many believe the current boycotts are unlikely to remain intact indefinitely . p art n erships i n middle east should hold firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is expanding in the middle east " we have no indication that business connections have gotten worse between german enterprises and their partners in the middle east , " said jochen clausnitzer , middle east expert at the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- . many german enterprises have maintained their long-standing partnerships in the region through personal interaction and trust .
this is a base which can not be destroyed so quickly - even if the outrage continues to surge through the region . " in the short term , sales of some european consumer goods producers could suffer , " clausnitzer said .
" however , on the other hand , western consumer goods in the region enjoy a high prestige . " ira n may seek to i n hibit busi n ess the main concern for german businesses then remains iran .
since the election of president ahmadinejad , many top positions in the economy and management have been taken by new people and there is little connection between german businesses and those who initially paved the way for the business links the two countries have enjoyed until recently .
those in the new positions are also likely to receive orders from the president not to do business with germany if relations deteriorate further . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the knock-on effect of un sanctions could hit germany 's economy any german involvement in sanctions against iran would also see sales of products already in the islamic republic drop off dramatically . " sanctions weld together the state and the population , " said clausnitzer , suggesting iranians would show support for their government by choosing not to buy german goods . however , germany - and europe as a whole - has a bargaining chip .
if ahmadinejad wants to carry out his promised infrastructure reform plans in iran he will have to depend on the eu as a trading partner .
in 2004 , almost 50 percent of all imports into iran came from europe .

kissing with tongues enables the potentially deadly meningococcal bacteria to pass between partners .
the australian team which carried out the british medical journal study of 144 teenagers defined multiple partners as between two and seven in two weeks .
lead researcher robert booy said teenagers should change their behaviour - but accepted most would not .
i do n't expect teenagers to become nuns and monks for the duration of their university career , but i would encourage them to be aware of the symptoms linda glennie , meningitis research foundation meningococcal disease is a life threatening condition .
incidence tends to peak in early childhood and in adolescence .
it can cause meningitis , an inflammation of the brain lining , or meninges , and septicaemia , which is the blood poisoning form of the disease .
the incidence and fatality rate among teenagers in england and the united states rose dramatically during the 1990s .
the introduction of the meningitis c vaccine in the uk in late 1999 - which is given to both babies and teenagers - has helped numbers drop but other forms of the infection remain a major problem .
it is known that around one in 10 teens carry meningococcal bacteria .
student risk the researchers questioned 144 teenagers aged 15 to 19 diagnosed with meningitis at english hospitals .
each was then compared with another teenager of the same age from their gp 's list .
the research team asked about factors which might increase or decrease the teenagers ' risk of meningitis .
some common symptoms high temperature , fever , possibly with cold hands and feet vomiting , sometimes diarrhoea severe headache joint and muscle pains , possible stomach cramps neck stiffness dislike of bright lights , disorientation blood samples and nose and throat swabs were also taken .
in addition to kissing multiple partners , a history of preceding illness , and being a student were linked to an increased risk of disease , while attendance at a religious event was linked to a lower risk .
other factors can increase someone 's risk of becoming ill if they are exposed to the bacteria , the researchers found .
having had the epstein-barr virus - itself called the ' kissing disease ' - is a factor , as is having an upper respiratory tract infection .
being a student also appeared to increase risk .
but attending religious services did not .
the researchers suggest these last two factors could be ' markers ' of behaviour , indicating whether they are more likely to have multiple kissing partners and be attending parties , where the meningococcal bacteria can also be passed on by smokers ' coughing .
being born prematurely was also a risk - appearing to affect immunity to infection even 15 to 20 years later .
teenagers ' not impervious ' professor robert booy , co-director of the national centre for immunisation research and surveillance at the children 's hospital westmead , sydney , led the study .
he said : " we all carry bacteria in out throats , and some of us will carry the meningococcal bacteria .
" they do n't exist very well outside of the body .
but if it can pass in saliva , from one person to the next , then it passes very easily . "
he said the findings might make teenagers think .
" they tend to think they are impervious and will live forever .
but if the message is this is something that could kill them in three days , it 's a little more adjacent . "
professor booy said he accepted that teenagers would continue to behave as they always had .
but he added : " i think they should change their behaviour .
we found the risk for those without a partner and those with one was the same .
" the message to people who snog two partners is that they 've probably also snogged two people , so you are multiplying your risk . "
linda glennie , head of research at the meningitis research foundation , which funded the study , said : " i do n't expect teenagers to become nuns and monks for the duration of their university career , but i would encourage them to be aware of the symptoms . "
philip kirby , chief executive of the meningitis trust added : " this research helps to highlight why students are the second most ' at risk ' group for meningococcal disease .
" in the general population about 10 % of people carry the meningococcal bacteria in the back of their throats , but in the student age group we know that this can increase to 30 % due to their increased social interaction .
" the study reinforces the need for continued awareness amongst 15 to19-year-olds . "

kissing with tongues enables the potentially deadly meningococcal bacteria to pass between partners .
the australian team which carried out the british medical journal study of 144 teenagers defined multiple partners as between two and seven in two weeks .
lead researcher robert booy said teenagers should change their behaviour - but accepted most would not .
i do n't expect teenagers to become nuns and monks for the duration of their university career , but i would encourage them to be aware of the symptoms linda glennie , meningitis research foundation meningococcal disease is a life threatening condition .
incidence tends to peak in early childhood and in adolescence .
it can cause meningitis , an inflammation of the brain lining , or meninges , and septicaemia , which is the blood poisoning form of the disease .
the incidence and fatality rate among teenagers in england and the united states rose dramatically during the 1990s .
the introduction of the meningitis c vaccine in the uk in late 1999 - which is given to both babies and teenagers - has helped numbers drop but other forms of the infection remain a major problem .
it is known that around one in 10 teens carry meningococcal bacteria .
student risk the researchers questioned 144 teenagers aged 15 to 19 diagnosed with meningitis at english hospitals .
each was then compared with another teenager of the same age from their gp 's list .
the research team asked about factors which might increase or decrease the teenagers ' risk of meningitis .
some common symptoms high temperature , fever , possibly with cold hands and feet vomiting , sometimes diarrhoea severe headache joint and muscle pains , possible stomach cramps neck stiffness dislike of bright lights , disorientation blood samples and nose and throat swabs were also taken .
in addition to kissing multiple partners , a history of preceding illness , and being a student were linked to an increased risk of disease , while attendance at a religious event was linked to a lower risk .
other factors can increase someone 's risk of becoming ill if they are exposed to the bacteria , the researchers found .
having had the epstein-barr virus - itself called the ' kissing disease ' - is a factor , as is having an upper respiratory tract infection .
being a student also appeared to increase risk .
but attending religious services did not .
the researchers suggest these last two factors could be ' markers ' of behaviour , indicating whether they are more likely to have multiple kissing partners and be attending parties , where the meningococcal bacteria can also be passed on by smokers ' coughing .
being born prematurely was also a risk - appearing to affect immunity to infection even 15 to 20 years later .
teenagers ' not impervious ' professor robert booy , co-director of the national centre for immunisation research and surveillance at the children 's hospital westmead , sydney , led the study .
he said : " we all carry bacteria in out throats , and some of us will carry the meningococcal bacteria .
" they do n't exist very well outside of the body .
but if it can pass in saliva , from one person to the next , then it passes very easily . "
he said the findings might make teenagers think .
" they tend to think they are impervious and will live forever .
but if the message is this is something that could kill them in three days , it 's a little more adjacent . "
professor booy said he accepted that teenagers would continue to behave as they always had .
but he added : " i think they should change their behaviour .
we found the risk for those without a partner and those with one was the same .
" the message to people who snog two partners is that they 've probably also snogged two people , so you are multiplying your risk . "
linda glennie , head of research at the meningitis research foundation , which funded the study , said : " i do n't expect teenagers to become nuns and monks for the duration of their university career , but i would encourage them to be aware of the symptoms . "
philip kirby , chief executive of the meningitis trust added : " this research helps to highlight why students are the second most ' at risk ' group for meningococcal disease .
" in the general population about 10 % of people carry the meningococcal bacteria in the back of their throats , but in the student age group we know that this can increase to 30 % due to their increased social interaction .
" the study reinforces the need for continued awareness amongst 15 to19-year-olds . "
a department of health spokeswoman said : " our advice already highlights kissing as a risk factor for meningitis .
" we keep all new research under review and always amend our advice if necessary . "

archaeologists have been examining a bronze age burial mound on the black mountain in carmarthenshire .
as well as analysing cremated bone , an urn and flint tools found in a cist , tests on soil taken from around the site found microscopic pollen grains .
researchers believe it paints a new picture of ancient burial rituals - more tender than previously thought .
the excavation on fan foel , above llyn y fan fach , was carried out by llandeilo-based cambria archaeology .
director gwilym hughes said the burial mound was slowly disappearing due to a combination of weather and the many walkers who climbed the mountain every year .
" visitors were collecting stones from the monument , " he said . "
it gives tenderness to otherwise remote and impersonal burial rites " adam gwilt , national museum of wales " the only solution was to excavate and record the vulnerable parts of the site and protect the remainder from further damage . "
at the centre of the mound archaeologists examined the contents of a large rectangle stone built cist that had been covered by a large capstone .
it contained cremated bone , a pottery urn , a bone pin and several flint tools .
the remains included that of a young child - possible no more than 12 years of age - plus the burnt bones of two pigs and possibly a dog .
it was radiocarbon-dated to about 2000 bc .
analysis of the soil surrounding the burial site by specialists from the university of lampeter found the microscopic pollen grains .
they show the burial was accompanied by a floral tribute of meadowsweet , which has attractive clusters of cream-white flowers .
adam gwilt , curator of the bronze and iron age collection at the national museum of wales , said the discovery shed new light on ancient burials .
he said : " it gives tenderness to otherwise remote and impersonal burial rites " .
mr gwilt said the same burial ritual had been found as far away as the orkney islands in scotland .
the researchers , funded by welsh historic monuments agency cadw , now believe as early as the early bronze age the upland areas of britain maintained common traditions when it came to death .

the office of rail regulation -lrb- orr -rrb- is proposing to reject gner 's bid for more east coast mainline trains saying the route can not cope with extra traffic .
but gner claims more than 5,000 people have contacted the orr in less than a week , supporting the extra services .
the orr said it wanted to hear public views before making a final decision .
the refusal of gner 's application is due in part to the orr 's draft approval of plans for a new company to run trains from yorkshire to london .
franchise agreement grand central wants to run three daily direct services on the east coast main line in competition with gner .
the trains would travel from bradford , halifax and york and be run without public money .
in january , the orr said it was minded to approve grand central 's plans but it would mean gner 's application and another from grand central for extra services to bradford would be rejected .
but gner argues it needs the extra capacity to run more services promised in its franchise agreement last year .
members of the public have until 13 february to voice their opinions on the orr 's draft decision .

a team from croydon primary care trust , south london , say the ban will increase the health gap between rich and poor .
the ban will see " a disproportionate increase in the number of smoke-free pubs in affluent areas " , they claim .
a snapshot survey of almost 500 randomly selected pubs across england was carried out for the study .
passive smoking these were considered along with the levels of deprivation people living nearby were exposed to .
the pubs were then contacted to find out whether or not they served hot food to determine whether they would be affected by the smoking ban .
researchers found a strong link between wealthy areas and pubs selling food , and poor areas and pubs not serving food .
therefore , they concluded , people in the poorest areas would not be as well protected against the effects of passive smoking because fewer pubs would be subject to the ban .

during an evening there , i meet a kurd , a serbian jew , and a german whose curly black hair betrays his mexican heritage .
this is the multicultural dream that germany 's left has promoted for decades - but which not everyone shares .
the christian democrat-led government of baden-wuerttemberg , of which stuttgart is the capital , has just introduced new " discussion guidelines " which have sparked national controversy .
they consist of 30 questions which can be put to applicants for german citizenship to see if they share democratic values .
but they have been strongly attacked as aimed against the state 's large turkish community - and dubbed " the muslim test " .
" this measure - the so-called discussion guidelines - means that i can not imagine applying for german citizenship in the near future , " says sueheyla ince , a local lawyer who was born in germany but holds a turkish passport .
" i have to prove , by answering these questions , that i 'm a ' good ' muslim , " she says , " because it puts all muslims under a general suspicion of terrorism and insinuates that they 're not interested in the values of the german constitution . "
the questions , which have been leaked to the german media , cover a range of subjects .
a few examples : how do you view the statement that a woman should obey her husband , and that he can beat her if she does n't ?
you learn that people from your neighbourhood or from among friends or acquaintances have carried out or are planning a terrorist attack - what do you do ?
some people hold the jews responsible for all the evil in the world , and even claim they were behind the attacks of 11 september 2001 in new york .
what is your view of this claim ?
imagine that your son comes to you and declares that he 's a homosexual and would like to live with another man .
how do you react ?
the new measure is the brainchild of the baden-wuerttemberg interior minister , heribert rech .
" when there are doubts about an applicant 's values , the easiest thing is for an official to have a talk with him - but not a talk about the weather or about football , " he says .
" it needs to be about his view of our constitution , of tolerance , of sexual equality , or of the state 's monopoly on the use of violence .
only with these questions can we come close to finding the answers we need . "
languages an opinion poll found 76 % of germans agree .
this country has around three million muslim inhabitants - mostly turkish , with bosnians making up the next largest group , followed by people of arab origin .
since 11 september 2001 , which was partly planned and carried out by muslim students based in hamburg , these communities have been viewed with suspicion . "
it 's not only a problem of migrants from muslim countries .
it 's a problem of christians and people who are already citizens of germany " cem ozdemir green party mep there have been controversies over headscarf bans -lrb- also first introduced in baden-wuerttemberg -rrb- and over so-called " honour killings " of muslim women by family members .
there is also currently a row over a berlin school that has banned the use of languages other than german in the playground .
but many politicians have said the " discussion guidelines " merely pander to popular stereotypes of muslims .
" mr rech is creating a problem which does not exist , " says cem ozdemir , a green party mep from baden-wuerttemberg .
" i would wish that we live in a world where everybody is accepting equal rights for gays and lesbians , where everybody fully understands the need for equal rights for men and women and so on .
" but unfortunately that is not the case - and it 's not only a problem of migrants from muslim countries .
it 's a problem of christians and people who are already citizens of germany . "
stuttgart 's turkish community is organising a petition drive and demonstrations .
but it is going to be an uphill battle .
a motion condemning the new measure , tabled by the greens in the bundestag , was defeated .
many politicians have voiced support for the guidelines , and the neighbouring state of hessen is now considering following baden-wuerttemberg 's lead .

robel teklemariam said he hopes his countrymen 's long-distance records on the track will translate into success in the cross-country skiing events .
teklemariam , who left ethiopia as a child , says without the financial help of ethiopians abroad , he would not have made it to february 's games in italy .
he was so determined to compete that he set up a national skiing federation to get the sport recognised for ethiopia .
teklemariam , who has been training professionally for three years , took up skiing soon after arriving in the united states at the age of nine .

" my first and foremost hero is abebe bikila , the ethiopian runner who ran barefoot in italy and won the gold medal there , " he said bikila went on to win another olympic gold in the 1960s and became the first athlete to win two olympic marathons .
teklemariam says even if he does not win a medal at the games that open in turin on friday , he hopes his appearance there will inspire other ethiopians - especially those living in colder climes .
" being a distance sport , a sport for endurance , i think eventually ethiopians will do pretty well in skiing cross-country down the road . "
he is grateful to the many ethiopians in the diaspora who have supported him over the last three years and to his family , without whom he says could not run the ethiopian national skiing federation .

security experts say that growing numbers are being conned into paying for fake anti-spyware programs .
now grassroots online security activists in the uk hope testimonies can raise awareness of the problem .
the number of malicious infections worldwide soared in 2005 , said security firm webroot .
in its annual report into spyware , webroot , which develops legitimate anti-spyware software , expressed concern over the increasing sophistication of attacks .
new laws in the us allow disgruntled computer users to petition the federal trade commission about unsolicited software . "
people hear so many horror stories about keyloggers , phishing sites , rootkits and trojans that they pay good money for a useless program " gwynne brothwood anti-spyware activist if the ftc gathers evidence of a crime , it can - and does - launch prosecutions .
last month two companies were ordered to hand back more than $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.14m -rrb- garnered through selling fake anti-spyware products .
but in the uk , which has the highest rate of spyware infection in europe , prosecution is more difficult .
local trading standards offices can register complaints , as can regional police forces , but there remains no easy central pathway to the national hi-tech crime unit .
part-time saviour gwynne brothwood , a volunteer who works feverishly in online forums training people to remove spyware and other infections , believes the issue needs to be resolved .
" the people who push this software make life a misery for vulnerable users , not just in the uk but worldwide , " mrs brothwood told the bbc news website .
spyware in europe spies per consumer pc oct to dec 2005 uk 21.6 norway 20.3 sweden : 19.1 lithuania 17.2 slovenia 15.7 source : webroot last year mrs brothwood was named a most valuable professional by microsoft for her security work .
she holds down a full-time job in the real world and can only work on the malware removal university website in her spare time .
in an effort to stir up public interest in the problem , she has helped set up an online forum for people infected with spyware , located at malwareremoval.com.
" all of a sudden people are bombarded with messages that they have spyware on their computer and that this particular program will clean them up , " mrs brothwood said .
" they hear so many horror stories in the news about keyloggers , phishing sites , rootkits and trojans that will steal your personal data that they panic and part with good money to pay for a program that is little more than useless .
" what they do n't know is that the makers of this program infected them in the first place . "
international issue according to the latest figures from webroot , there are more than 21 online spies for every windows pc in the uk , the highest figure in europe .
but the problem does not respect national borders .
other forms of so-called malware have spread further as internet use has grown .
in poland , 867 of every 1,000 domestic pcs have been infected by trojans , unsolicited programs that can allow remote users to control the machine .
it is this international reach that concerns those in authority trying to combat the spread of spyware .
" the real problem is that there is a need to encourage active international co-operation to bring about an end to this , " said andrew miller mp , who chairs of the uk parliamentary information technology committee -lrb- pitcom -rrb- .
last year webroot organised a high-level international conference to raise awareness of the problems .
major developers of security software have announced plans to collaborate .
nevertheless , for those millions who find themselves infected today , their first port of call is rarely a government agency or even a high-profile security firm like symantec or mcafee .
alliance instead worried pc owners wind up at sites run by highly-skilled volunteers like gwynne brothwood and her colleague chris davis .
staying safe online install anti-virus software keep your anti-virus software up to date install a personal firewall use windows updates to patch security holes use reputable anti-spyware programs such as adaware or spybot do not open e-mail messages that look suspicious do not click on e-mail attachments you were not expecting spyware warrior , a high-profile us-based website , has become a key port of call .
the site includes an exhaustive index of rogue anti-spyware programs , and key players suzi turner and eric howes have emerged as minor celebrities in the fight against spyware .
andrew miller mp wants uk web users to see a direct route from infection to diagnosis , official complaint and , he hopes , possible criminal action by the national hi-tech crime unit .
the government has launched a portal site for users , called get safe online , but making it stand out from the welter of self-help and self-harm websites cluttering the net is a tough proposition .
mr miller said that the challenges of streamlining even a uk-wide fight against spyware were " enormous " .
" people will need to take advice and receive support from well-meaning people not working for government agencies , " he said .
" that kind of co-operation is going to be a pre-requisite . "

security experts say that growing numbers are being conned into paying for fake anti-spyware programs .
now grassroots online security activists in the uk hope testimonies can raise awareness of the problem .
the number of malicious infections worldwide soared in 2005 , said security firm webroot .
in its annual report into spyware , webroot , which develops legitimate anti-spyware software , expressed concern over the increasing sophistication of attacks .
new laws in the us allow disgruntled computer users to petition the federal trade commission about unsolicited software .
people hear so many horror stories about keyloggers , phishing sites , rootkits and trojans that they pay good money for a useless program gwynne brothwood anti-spyware activist if the ftc gathers evidence of a crime , it can - and does - launch prosecutions .
last month two companies were ordered to hand back more than $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.14m -rrb- garnered through selling fake anti-spyware products .
but in the uk , which has the highest rate of spyware infection in europe , prosecution is more difficult .
local trading standards offices can register complaints , as can regional police forces , but there remains no easy central pathway to the national hi-tech crime unit .
part-time saviour gwynne brothwood , a volunteer who works feverishly in online forums training people to remove spyware and other infections , believes the issue needs to be resolved .
" the people who push this software make life a misery for vulnerable users , not just in the uk but worldwide , " mrs brothwood told the bbc news website .

international issue according to the latest figures from webroot , there are more than 21 online spies for every windows pc in the uk , the highest figure in europe .
but the problem does not respect national borders .
other forms of so-called malware have spread further as internet use has grown .
andrew miller mp hopes the uk can fight back against spyware in poland , 867 of every 1,000 domestic pcs have been infected by trojans , unsolicited programs that can allow remote users to control the machine .
it is this international reach that concerns those in authority trying to combat the spread of spyware .
" the real problem is that there is a need to encourage active international co-operation to bring about an end to this , " said andrew miller mp , who chairs of the uk parliamentary information technology committee -lrb- pitcom -rrb- .
last year webroot organised a high-level international conference to raise awareness of the problems .

scientists in australia have developed an environmentally friendly coating containing special nanoparticles that could do the job of cleaning and disinfecting for us .
" if you have self-cleaning materials , you can do the job properly without having to use disinfectants and other chemicals , " says researcher rose amal at the particles and catalysts research group , university of new south wales , where the coating is being developed .
previously self-cleaning materials were limited to outdoor applications because ultraviolet light was required to activate the molecules in the coatings . "
less time cleaning the bathroom is rather appealing " mary taylor , friends of the earth these surfaces contain tiny particles of titanium dioxide , which become excited when they absorb ultraviolet light with a wavelength of less than 380 nanometres .
light activated this gives the particles an oxidizing ability stronger than chlorine bleach .
the excited particles can break down organic compounds and kill bacteria .
the new coating contains modified particles of titanium dioxide , which are doped with other cations like iron or vanadium and anions like oxygen , nitrogen or carbon .
this coating can absorb light at the higher wavelengths in visible light , such as the bathroom light .
lab experiments revealed the surface of coated glass could kill the bacteria e. coli -lrb- escherichia coli -rrb- and degrade volatile organic compounds in visible light .
the oxidising properties also mean fungus can not grow on the surface .
and because the coating is hydrophobic - it does not like water - the water simply slides away carrying any dirt with it , rather than gathering as droplets .
using the coating in baths and sinks would not pose any problems with skin irritation , according to amal .
" when the bath is filled , the water would attenuate the light so i do n't think the surface would activate .
it will only be active if the light can reach the surface , " she says .
possible disadvantages friends of the earth spokesperson mary taylor said that if materials like this could prolong the lifetime of an object , this would be an advantage in environmental terms .
but she warned : " such a hi-tech material might have some disadvantages .
" we would have to consider , for example , whether the material could be recycled or disposed of safely , and how much more energy went into production of the raw materials and its manufacture . "
however , she added : " less time cleaning the bathroom is rather appealing , and there might be some special uses , maybe in hospitals , where such materials could be a boon . "

" if you have self-cleaning materials , you can do the job properly without having to use disinfectants and other chemicals , " says researcher rose amal at the particles and catalysts research group , university of new south wales , where the coating is being developed .
previously self-cleaning materials were limited to outdoor applications because ultraviolet light was required to activate the molecules in the coatings .
less time cleaning the bathroom is rather appealing mary taylor , friends of the earth these surfaces contain tiny particles of titanium dioxide , which become excited when they absorb ultraviolet light with a wavelength of less than 380 nanometres .
light activated this gives the particles an oxidizing ability stronger than chlorine bleach .
the excited particles can break down organic compounds and kill bacteria .
the new coating contains modified particles of titanium dioxide , which are doped with other cations like iron or vanadium and anions like oxygen , nitrogen or carbon .
this coating can absorb light at the higher wavelengths in visible light , such as the bathroom light .
the coating can kill bacteria such as e. coli lab experiments revealed the surface of coated glass could kill the bacteria e. coli -lrb- escherichia coli -rrb- and degrade volatile organic compounds in visible light .
the oxidising properties also mean fungus can not grow on the surface .
and because the coating is hydrophobic - it does not like water - the water simply slides away carrying any dirt with it , rather than gathering as droplets .
using the coating in baths and sinks would not pose any problems with skin irritation , according to amal .
" when the bath is filled , the water would attenuate the light so i do n't think the surface would activate .
it will only be active if the light can reach the surface , " she says .
possible disadvantages friends of the earth spokesperson mary taylor said that if materials like this could prolong the lifetime of an object , this would be an advantage in environmental terms .
but she warned : " such a hi-tech material might have some disadvantages .
" we would have to consider , for example , whether the material could be recycled or disposed of safely , and how much more energy went into production of the raw materials and its manufacture . "
however , she added : " less time cleaning the bathroom is rather appealing , and there might be some special uses , maybe in hospitals , where such materials could be a boon . "

the company has suggested a third party should help facilitate talks with the communications workers union about ways to improve industrial relations .
mail deliveries have been disrupted since the unofficial strike began on 31 january .
belfast has been worst hit .
nearly half of belfast city hospital outpatient appointments were missed this week after letters did not arrive .
talks were held at the labour relations agency -lrb- lra -rrb- on thursday evening but there was no breakthrough in the 10-day-long dispute .
david peden of royal mail said they were awaiting a response from the union to an offer which they had made two days ago .
" we would be very hopeful that we can get a quick response from this and the right response has to be to get people back to work , get people in around the table , discussing the issues .
we can look back and we can learn lessons , " he said .
" we can not have illegal stoppages when outcomes of cases go against what people 's expectations are ; we can not have people walking out of their work when things go against them .
we need to have a mature relationship where things can move forward and we do n't interrupt the service to our customers david peden royal mail " we need to have a mature relationship where things can move forward and we do n't interrupt the service to our customers . "
he said about 60 people had returned to work since the weekend and that more managers were doing deliveries .
mr peden also said mail had been delivered to most of south belfast in the last couple of days and also to parts of great britain .
however , the dispute is having a knock-on effect in other sectors of the community .
belfast city hospital said almost 1,000 people had not kept their outpatient appointments this week as reminder letters did not arrive .
lack of support cancer clinics are , so far , unaffected but oncologists at the hospital fear they could be hit next week if the postal strike continues .
carmel hanna of the sdlp said on friday it was in " nobody 's interest " for the dispute to go on .
" it 's got to be brought to an end , " she said .
" both parties in this dispute do need to be aware of their wider social responsibilities , particularly if people are missing appointments for scans where they may have a serious illness . "
the dispute was started by more than 200 postal workers at the city 's tomb street depot following difficulties between staff and management over disciplinary procedures and other issues in the north belfast section .
it is understood the dispute relates to allegations of widespread bullying and harassment in the company .
however , royal mail rejected the claims , saying the company was only dealing with a small number of cases .
post has been disrupted in north , south and west belfast but an attempt to widen the strike to londonderry failed because of a lack of support for the belfast workers .
royal mail and the social security agency have issued advice to customers affected by the dispute .
the agency said people who normally received benefit payments through the mail should collect it from their nearest post office .
royal mail said customers needing more information and advice could contact its helpline number on 08457 740740 .

the company has suggested a third party should help facilitate talks with the communications workers union about ways to improve industrial relations .
mail deliveries have been disrupted since the unofficial strike began on 31 january .
belfast has been worst hit .
nearly half of belfast city hospital outpatient appointments were missed this week after letters did not arrive .
talks were held at the labour relations agency -lrb- lra -rrb- on thursday evening but there was no breakthrough in the 10-day-long dispute .
david peden of royal mail said they were awaiting a response from the union to an offer which they had made two days ago .
" we would be very hopeful that we can get a quick response from this and the right response has to be to get people back to work , get people in around the table , discussing the issues .
we can look back and we can learn lessons , " he said .
" we can not have illegal stoppages when outcomes of cases go against what people 's expectations are ; we can not have people walking out of their work when things go against them .
we need to have a mature relationship where things can move forward and we do n't interrupt the service to our customers david peden royal mail " we need to have a mature relationship where things can move forward and we do n't interrupt the service to our customers . "
he said about 60 people had returned to work since the weekend and that more managers were doing deliveries .
mr peden also said mail had been delivered to most of south belfast in the last couple of days and also to parts of great britain .
however , the dispute is having a knock-on effect in other sectors of the community .
belfast city hospital said almost 1,000 people had not kept their outpatient appointments this week as reminder letters did not arrive .
lack of support cancer clinics are , so far , unaffected but oncologists at the hospital fear they could be hit next week if the postal strike continues .
carmel hanna of the sdlp said on friday it was in " nobody 's interest " for the dispute to go on .
" it 's got to be brought to an end , " she said .
" both parties in this dispute do need to be aware of their wider social responsibilities , particularly if people are missing appointments for scans where they may have a serious illness . "
the dispute was started by more than 200 postal workers at the city 's tomb street depot following difficulties between staff and management over disciplinary procedures and other issues in the north belfast section .
it is understood the dispute relates to allegations of widespread bullying and harassment in the company .
however , royal mail rejected the claims , saying the company was only dealing with a small number of cases .
