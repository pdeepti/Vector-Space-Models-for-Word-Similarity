" german chancellor angela merkel said on tuesday she hoped the ailing eu constitution would be put " back on track " and called on members of the bloc to focus on their common interests .
" we hope to get this project -lrb- the eu constitution -rrb- back on track , but we know that we must take many factors into account and we must consider how to proceed between now and 2009 -lrb- when european elections are scheduled -rrb- so that the european union regains its ability to act , " merkel said . " we must focus on the union and on common interests , and it is important for us to concentrate on them and not on our differences , " the german chancellor told reporters after a meeting with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . merkel 's brief visit to denmark was part of a tour of european capitals prior to germany taking over the rotating six-month eu presidency from current holder finland on january 1 .

" the eu accession of romania and bulgaria shows that we truly need institutional reforms , " he said . the eu 's constitution aims to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc but it has been stalled since dutch and french voters rejected it last year . steinmeier also said it was important for the eu to speak as one voice on international issues . steinmeier promised the eu would keep a close watch on volatile middle east politics and focus on revitalizing peace efforts by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations . " we are very worried about the dangers of escalation in the middle east , " he said , adding that the eu would push for contacts between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas . focus on central asia the foreign minister said germany wanted to develop a strategy for central asia during its six months leading the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier visited the five energy-rich central asian countries in november according to steinmeier , who visited five central asian countries in november , " the region has been underestimated . " " despite their proximity to russia and china , many of these countries look to europe , " steinmeier said .
" in addition , the area is resource-rich , and therefore is of interest to the eu 's economic and energy policies . " finland done excellent job steinmeier also thanked the finish presidency for its " excellent work , " especially in light of last week 's decision to partially freeze eu accession talks with turkey over the country 's refusal to establish transport links with eu-member cyprus . he said solving the crisis over the turkish northern cyprus would be a priority during germany 's presidency . but steinmeier played down expectations of any breakthroughs during germany 's presidency .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he " respected " the muslim leaders who had refused to attend , but his ministry said earlier that nine of the 15 muslim representatives invited would be present . a second performance of the opera is scheduled for dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.12.2006 german government under pressure over co2 policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions have been derided by the eu the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest . the german government has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place after the eu commission dismissed its plan for cutting greenhouse gases as woefully inadequate and german utilities warned that more ambitious climate protection goals would risk jobs and the current economic upswing . in a letter received by the government at the weekend , germany ’ s leading four utilities hinted that they might have to re-examine their investments and would have to cut costs if the government gave in to eu demands .
the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .
so the current struggle for power in germany may only be the prelude to a long and tough climate battle in the eu . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says eu 's emissions requirements are unreasonable just weeks before germany assumes both the eu and g8 presidencies , the european commission has said berlin is n't doing enough to reduce co2 emissions , although germany has declared climate policy a top priority .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .
her lyrics , she talks about what she sees happening around her - the lack of prospects among germany 's youth , conflict between old and young and , above all , the question of roots . at home but not entirely berlin is sahira 's home , she says in her songs , but she also sees the problems that immigrants and the children of immigrants - like her - experience .
" home for me is somewhere where i do n't cause offence and i can feel myself as a whole , " she said .
" i dream in german , i think in german , and among arabs i also feel pretty german , but there is a difference .
it 's weird that you ca n't really settle here completely , that you never see someone like yourself in the media .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .
her lyrics , she talks about what she sees happening around her - the lack of prospects among germany 's youth , conflict between old and young and , above all , the question of roots . at home but not entirely berlin is sahira 's home , she says in her songs , but she also sees the problems that immigrants and the children of immigrants - like her - experience .
" home for me is somewhere where i do n't cause offence and i can feel myself as a whole , " she said .
" i dream in german , i think in german , and among arabs i also feel pretty german , but there is a difference .
it 's weird that you ca n't really settle here completely , that you never see someone like yourself in the media . " that 's why sahira tries to be a role model for young people , whether of immigrant origin or not , and to show that a practicing muslim can be just as emancipated and self-assured as any other woman . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians rally around lawmaker in headscarf row in germany politicians from across the spectrum have expressed solidarity with a green party parliamentarian of turkish origin who has received death threats after urging muslim women in germany to take off their headscarves .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .
her lyrics , she talks about what she sees happening around her - the lack of prospects among germany 's youth , conflict between old and young and , above all , the question of roots . at home but not entirely berlin is sahira 's home , she says in her songs , but she also sees the problems that immigrants and the children of immigrants - like her - experience .
" home for me is somewhere where i do n't cause offence and i can feel myself as a whole , " she said .
" i dream in german , i think in german , and among arabs i also feel pretty german , but there is a difference .
it 's weird that you ca n't really settle here completely , that you never see someone like yourself in the media . " that 's why sahira tries to be a role model for young people , whether of immigrant origin or not , and to show that a practicing muslim can be just as emancipated and self-assured as any other woman . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians rally around lawmaker in headscarf row in germany politicians from across the spectrum have expressed solidarity with a green party parliamentarian of turkish origin who has received death threats after urging muslim women in germany to take off their headscarves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.12.2006 faced with violent behavior , german schools need to rethink großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enforcing school rules is a tough job playground violence has been writing a lot of banner headlines across germany lately , but is it really symptomatic of an increase in aggressive behavior among the younger generation , or a sign of our media-mad times ? first there was the case of the teacher who was attacked by a pupil for intervening in a playground disagreement . then came a shock high school shooting followed by a spate of copycat threats , and last week , a near-fatal stabbing at a school in hamburg . besides , there are hundreds and thousands more horrific , if less prolific , cases of schoolyard aggression happening up and down the country on a weekly basis . so what 's got into germany 's schools ?
roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink . " if parents were willing to look at this situation and consider what they could do to change it rather than sinking into a collective depression , if they could be optimistic and strong in the face of the problem , then we 'd be getting somewhere .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .

" the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .
so the current struggle for power in germany may only be the prelude to a long and tough climate battle in the eu . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says eu 's emissions requirements are unreasonable just weeks before germany assumes both the eu and g8 presidencies , the european commission has said berlin is n't doing enough to reduce co2 emissions , although germany has declared climate policy a top priority .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .
her lyrics , she talks about what she sees happening around her - the lack of prospects among germany 's youth , conflict between old and young and , above all , the question of roots . at home but not entirely berlin is sahira 's home , she says in her songs , but she also sees the problems that immigrants and the children of immigrants - like her - experience .
" home for me is somewhere where i do n't cause offence and i can feel myself as a whole , " she said .
" i dream in german , i think in german , and among arabs i also feel pretty german , but there is a difference .
it 's weird that you ca n't really settle here completely , that you never see someone like yourself in the media . " that 's why sahira tries to be a role model for young people , whether of immigrant origin or not , and to show that a practicing muslim can be just as emancipated and self-assured as any other woman . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians rally around lawmaker in headscarf row in germany politicians from across the spectrum have expressed solidarity with a green party parliamentarian of turkish origin who has received death threats after urging muslim women in germany to take off their headscarves .

the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .

dw-world.de gives you a brief overview of the country 's popular winter destinations . whether you 're looking for alpine black diamonds , stretches of pristine forest for a cross-country outing or an urban ski experience , there are plenty of cool ways to spend the winter in germany . eastern germany 's harz region is the place to go for people looking to spend some quite time outdoors before returning to cozy towns for a warm drink .
the area boasts of 500 kilometers -lrb- 311 miles -rrb- of cross-country trail as well as plenty of room for a more relaxed horse-drawn sleigh ride . the german alps are the best options for those looking to take their life in their hands .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .

" " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament . " " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .
and we will react , " fotyga said in an interview with polish public radio . asked whether that could include renegotiating poland 's decade-old accord with germany , which was meant to put relations on an even keel after the end of the cold war , fotyga said : " yes , exactly . " however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .
the preussische treuhand 's action is far from well-supported in germany , even by the powerful confederation of the displaced -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which represents two million germans .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament . " " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .

" however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he " respected " the muslim leaders who had refused to attend , but his ministry said earlier that nine of the 15 muslim representatives invited would be present . a second performance of the opera is scheduled for dec .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept .

" show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .
her lyrics , she talks about what she sees happening around her - the lack of prospects among germany 's youth , conflict between old and young and , above all , the question of roots . at home but not entirely berlin is sahira 's home , she says in her songs , but she also sees the problems that immigrants and the children of immigrants - like her - experience .
" home for me is somewhere where i do n't cause offence and i can feel myself as a whole , " she said .
" i dream in german , i think in german , and among arabs i also feel pretty german , but there is a difference .
it 's weird that you ca n't really settle here completely , that you never see someone like yourself in the media . " that 's why sahira tries to be a role model for young people , whether of immigrant origin or not , and to show that a practicing muslim can be just as emancipated and self-assured as any other woman . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians rally around lawmaker in headscarf row in germany politicians from across the spectrum have expressed solidarity with a green party parliamentarian of turkish origin who has received death threats after urging muslim women in germany to take off their headscarves .

she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .
her lyrics , she talks about what she sees happening around her - the lack of prospects among germany 's youth , conflict between old and young and , above all , the question of roots . at home but not entirely berlin is sahira 's home , she says in her songs , but she also sees the problems that immigrants and the children of immigrants - like her - experience .
" home for me is somewhere where i do n't cause offence and i can feel myself as a whole , " she said .
" i dream in german , i think in german , and among arabs i also feel pretty german , but there is a difference .
it 's weird that you ca n't really settle here completely , that you never see someone like yourself in the media . " that 's why sahira tries to be a role model for young people , whether of immigrant origin or not , and to show that a practicing muslim can be just as emancipated and self-assured as any other woman . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians rally around lawmaker in headscarf row in germany politicians from across the spectrum have expressed solidarity with a green party parliamentarian of turkish origin who has received death threats after urging muslim women in germany to take off their headscarves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2006 hip-hop with a headscarf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin rapper sahira rejects the notion that headscarves symbolize women 's oppression sahira is currently one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists .
she raps about islam , the koran and life in germany as a muslim who wears a headscarf . " i just do n't get why she likes that scarf in her hair , " 27-year-old sahira raps .
the berliner of palestinian origin has big , doe eyes and is wearing trendy jeans , a shiny top and a hijab , a tight-fitting headscarf .
she is one of berlin 's most successful hip-hop artists . until a few years ago , sahira wore her hair uncovered .
but sept .
11 changed all that .
she was shocked that islam was portrayed as a religion of terror and that muslims as a whole came under suspicion .
she started reading the koran so she could make her own opinion , and she liked what she read .
she was attracted to the spirituality and peaceful philosophy of this world religion - aspects which were hardly ever mentioned in the media . she started to pray five times a day , and , in november 2003 for the first time , she went out in public wearing a headscarf .
it was her own decision , as she explains in her lyrics : " for me it means freedom .
it 's my head , my hair , it 's me .
only my man sees me exactly as i am , -lrb- … -rrb- coz that 's what i want . " different approaches sahira comes from a family of eight .
her parents placed great value on education , insisting that all the children learn perfect german .
the family is a good example of different approaches to islam and to practicing religion as a whole .
some of sahira 's sisters are more religious and wear headscarves , while her mother and other sisters do not .
and the fact that sahira is a single mother is not a cause for shame for the family , but rather a reason to support her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green politician ekin deligöz called for women to remove their scarves the singer wishes there were as much tolerance within the whole headscarf debate .
it annoys her that in germany and other parts of western europe the headscarf is often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of women . she said it was wrong for people , whether religious or not , to use a political platform to call for all women to remove their headscarves , as german green party politician ekin deligöz recently did .
" i would n't want women to be told they had to wear one either .
in general , i do n't like the idea of such a dictatorship , " sahira said . no problem in the hip-hop scene sahira , who 's been making music for a decade , has n't encountered problems wearing her headscarf in the hip-hop scene .
from the start of her career , she has felt that her male colleagues respected her for her music . she wore a headscarf when she recorded a song with successful - and controversial - rap artist bushido , and it was n't an issue .
on the contrary , she felt that she was handled with respect for having worn it .
in the meantime , she ca n't imagine going out with her hair uncovered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper bushido in contrast to some of her male colleagues in the rap scene , glorification of violence and machismo are strictly taboo in her work .

" german chancellor angela merkel said on tuesday she hoped the ailing eu constitution would be put " back on track " and called on members of the bloc to focus on their common interests .
" we hope to get this project -lrb- the eu constitution -rrb- back on track , but we know that we must take many factors into account and we must consider how to proceed between now and 2009 -lrb- when european elections are scheduled -rrb- so that the european union regains its ability to act , " merkel said . " we must focus on the union and on common interests , and it is important for us to concentrate on them and not on our differences , " the german chancellor told reporters after a meeting with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . merkel 's brief visit to denmark was part of a tour of european capitals prior to germany taking over the rotating six-month eu presidency from current holder finland on january 1 .

" the eu accession of romania and bulgaria shows that we truly need institutional reforms , " he said . the eu 's constitution aims to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc but it has been stalled since dutch and french voters rejected it last year . steinmeier also said it was important for the eu to speak as one voice on international issues . steinmeier promised the eu would keep a close watch on volatile middle east politics and focus on revitalizing peace efforts by the so-called middle east quartet , which includes the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations . " we are very worried about the dangers of escalation in the middle east , " he said , adding that the eu would push for contacts between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas . focus on central asia the foreign minister said germany wanted to develop a strategy for central asia during its six months leading the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier visited the five energy-rich central asian countries in november according to steinmeier , who visited five central asian countries in november , " the region has been underestimated . " " despite their proximity to russia and china , many of these countries look to europe , " steinmeier said .
" in addition , the area is resource-rich , and therefore is of interest to the eu 's economic and energy policies . " finland done excellent job steinmeier also thanked the finish presidency for its " excellent work , " especially in light of last week 's decision to partially freeze eu accession talks with turkey over the country 's refusal to establish transport links with eu-member cyprus . he said solving the crisis over the turkish northern cyprus would be a priority during germany 's presidency . but steinmeier played down expectations of any breakthroughs during germany 's presidency .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament .

the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .

" " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .
and we will react , " fotyga said in an interview with polish public radio . asked whether that could include renegotiating poland 's decade-old accord with germany , which was meant to put relations on an even keel after the end of the cold war , fotyga said : " yes , exactly . " however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .
the preussische treuhand 's action is far from well-supported in germany , even by the powerful confederation of the displaced -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which represents two million germans .
some 14 million germans fled or were expelled , often extremely brutally , from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's nazi third reich crumbled .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .
bulgaria and its allies have rejected this , saying a payout would admit guilt . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the shift in libya 's relations to the west the la belle disco bombing in berlin on april 5 , 1986 was ruled to be libya 's doing .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament .

the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .

" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament . " " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .
and we will react , " fotyga said in an interview with polish public radio . asked whether that could include renegotiating poland 's decade-old accord with germany , which was meant to put relations on an even keel after the end of the cold war , fotyga said : " yes , exactly . " however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .
the preussische treuhand 's action is far from well-supported in germany , even by the powerful confederation of the displaced -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which represents two million germans .
some 14 million germans fled or were expelled , often extremely brutally , from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's nazi third reich crumbled .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .
bulgaria and its allies have rejected this , saying a payout would admit guilt . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the shift in libya 's relations to the west the la belle disco bombing in berlin on april 5 , 1986 was ruled to be libya 's doing .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink . " if parents were willing to look at this situation and consider what they could do to change it rather than sinking into a collective depression , if they could be optimistic and strong in the face of the problem , then we 'd be getting somewhere .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .

children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "

nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

" show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 19.12.2006 europe condemns libya 's death penalty for foreign medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign medics have been imprisoned since 1999 european leaders are outraged after a libyan court sentenced five bulgarians nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for spreading the aids virus among children . the six medics were accused of infecting 426 children with hiv while they were working at al-fateh hospital in the libyan seaside city of benghazi , during the 1990s .
fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .
bulgaria and its allies have rejected this , saying a payout would admit guilt . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the shift in libya 's relations to the west the la belle disco bombing in berlin on april 5 , 1986 was ruled to be libya 's doing .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .

" the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .

children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .

the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament . " " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .
and we will react , " fotyga said in an interview with polish public radio . asked whether that could include renegotiating poland 's decade-old accord with germany , which was meant to put relations on an even keel after the end of the cold war , fotyga said : " yes , exactly . " however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .
the preussische treuhand 's action is far from well-supported in germany , even by the powerful confederation of the displaced -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which represents two million germans .
some 14 million germans fled or were expelled , often extremely brutally , from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's nazi third reich crumbled .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

" show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he " respected " the muslim leaders who had refused to attend , but his ministry said earlier that nine of the 15 muslim representatives invited would be present . a second performance of the opera is scheduled for dec .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink . " if parents were willing to look at this situation and consider what they could do to change it rather than sinking into a collective depression , if they could be optimistic and strong in the face of the problem , then we 'd be getting somewhere .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.12.2006 german government under pressure over co2 policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions have been derided by the eu the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest . the german government has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place after the eu commission dismissed its plan for cutting greenhouse gases as woefully inadequate and german utilities warned that more ambitious climate protection goals would risk jobs and the current economic upswing . in a letter received by the government at the weekend , germany ’ s leading four utilities hinted that they might have to re-examine their investments and would have to cut costs if the government gave in to eu demands .
the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .
so the current struggle for power in germany may only be the prelude to a long and tough climate battle in the eu . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says eu 's emissions requirements are unreasonable just weeks before germany assumes both the eu and g8 presidencies , the european commission has said berlin is n't doing enough to reduce co2 emissions , although germany has declared climate policy a top priority .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .

it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .

" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 19.12.2006 curtain opens on idomeneo without incident großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of demonstrators assembled outside the deutsche oper monday night ringed by riot police , one of berlin 's three opera houses monday staged a controversial production of mozart 's opera idomeneo , three months after fears of violence had led to its sudden cancellation . several dozen police patrolled outside the deutsche oper , a modern building in western berlin , before and during monday 's performance .
authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.12.2006 pope 's notorious regensburg talk named speech of the year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was he deliberately misunderstood ?
tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- mulling the consequences of the pope 's speech many dw-world.de readers this week commented on pope benedict xvi 's speech in regensburg , which was followed by protests from muslim hardliners .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- mulling the consequences of the pope 's speech many dw-world.de readers this week commented on pope benedict xvi 's speech in regensburg , which was followed by protests from muslim hardliners .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision .

" " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure .

he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament . " " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .
and we will react , " fotyga said in an interview with polish public radio . asked whether that could include renegotiating poland 's decade-old accord with germany , which was meant to put relations on an even keel after the end of the cold war , fotyga said : " yes , exactly . " however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .
the preussische treuhand 's action is far from well-supported in germany , even by the powerful confederation of the displaced -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which represents two million germans .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink . " if parents were willing to look at this situation and consider what they could do to change it rather than sinking into a collective depression , if they could be optimistic and strong in the face of the problem , then we 'd be getting somewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.12.2006 faced with violent behavior , german schools need to rethink großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enforcing school rules is a tough job playground violence has been writing a lot of banner headlines across germany lately , but is it really symptomatic of an increase in aggressive behavior among the younger generation , or a sign of our media-mad times ? first there was the case of the teacher who was attacked by a pupil for intervening in a playground disagreement . then came a shock high school shooting followed by a spate of copycat threats , and last week , a near-fatal stabbing at a school in hamburg . besides , there are hundreds and thousands more horrific , if less prolific , cases of schoolyard aggression happening up and down the country on a weekly basis . so what 's got into germany 's schools ?
roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he " respected " the muslim leaders who had refused to attend , but his ministry said earlier that nine of the 15 muslim representatives invited would be present . a second performance of the opera is scheduled for dec .

" we must focus on the union and on common interests , and it is important for us to concentrate on them and not on our differences , " the german chancellor told reporters after a meeting with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen . merkel 's brief visit to denmark was part of a tour of european capitals prior to germany taking over the rotating six-month eu presidency from current holder finland on january 1 .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .
so the current struggle for power in germany may only be the prelude to a long and tough climate battle in the eu . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says eu 's emissions requirements are unreasonable just weeks before germany assumes both the eu and g8 presidencies , the european commission has said berlin is n't doing enough to reduce co2 emissions , although germany has declared climate policy a top priority .

fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he " respected " the muslim leaders who had refused to attend , but his ministry said earlier that nine of the 15 muslim representatives invited would be present . a second performance of the opera is scheduled for dec .

kaczynski said parliament should declare that warsaw would not respect any court verdict that calls poles ' rights into question .
kaczynski 's comments came after the preussiche treuhand or prussian claims society , which represents a small group of expelled germans , filed suits with the european court of human rights accusing poland of violating the rights of those expelled from their prewar homes when borders were redrawn in 1945 .
the suit seeks compensation for lost property . in a broadcast , kaczynski said " the issue is truly a serious one , requiring a swift action on the part of our parliament . " " we must have a law on the primary character of ownership , and there must be a clear declaration made that poland will not respect verdicts that would question polish law in this respect , " kaczynski said . foreign minister anna fotyga also slammed moves by the prussian claims society which lodged 22 claims last week at the european court of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organisation preussische treuhand has filed claims against poland for property lost after wwii " such actions as the complaint by the preussische treuhand call for clear reactions .
and we will react , " fotyga said in an interview with polish public radio . asked whether that could include renegotiating poland 's decade-old accord with germany , which was meant to put relations on an even keel after the end of the cold war , fotyga said : " yes , exactly . " however , she cautioned , a treaty review would " require the decision of both parties . " no claim to polish land poland signed two treaties with its neighbor after east and west germany were reunified in 1990 following the collapse of communism . one , in november 1990 , set the polish-german border in stone and said that germany had no territorial claims in poland . the second deal , signed a year later , created a system of cooperation between warsaw and berlin which includes regular talks between both governments as well as youth exchanges . the treaties , however , did not deal with the thorny question of territorial claims by individuals , which has posed diplomatic problems between the countries for years . heightened tensions the issue has been a particular bone of contention since conservative president lech kaczynski and twin brother of the prime minister came to power last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- , seen here with his twin brother , has threatend to sue germany for wwii destruction on saturday , kaczynski launched his most scathing attack yet on germany , demanding that the germany government act to end property lawsuits and saying that a new accord was needed to stop claims from either side . kaczynski has previously warned that poland could counter german lawsuits with multi-billion-euro cases for destruction during the war-time nazi occupation of poland . kaczynski also said " obvious anti-polish sentiment that 's often racist " had increased in germany , adding to jittery diplomatic relations .
the polish president sparked an immediate reaction from germany , which said that it would not make a policy decision on the property issue .
a government spokesman said that the government prefers to " not support individual claims " but also " not oppose such steps . "
germany 's chancellor angela merkel , in line with all post-war german governments , has remained as neutral as possible on the issue to avoid clashing head on with the large numbers of affected germans .
the preussische treuhand 's action is far from well-supported in germany , even by the powerful confederation of the displaced -lrb- bdv -rrb- , which represents two million germans .
some 14 million germans fled or were expelled , often extremely brutally , from their homes in eastern europe from 1944 as the soviet red army advanced and germany 's nazi third reich crumbled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.12.2006 faced with violent behavior , german schools need to rethink großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enforcing school rules is a tough job playground violence has been writing a lot of banner headlines across germany lately , but is it really symptomatic of an increase in aggressive behavior among the younger generation , or a sign of our media-mad times ? first there was the case of the teacher who was attacked by a pupil for intervening in a playground disagreement . then came a shock high school shooting followed by a spate of copycat threats , and last week , a near-fatal stabbing at a school in hamburg . besides , there are hundreds and thousands more horrific , if less prolific , cases of schoolyard aggression happening up and down the country on a weekly basis . so what 's got into germany 's schools ?
roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink . " if parents were willing to look at this situation and consider what they could do to change it rather than sinking into a collective depression , if they could be optimistic and strong in the face of the problem , then we 'd be getting somewhere .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .

children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .

nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .

lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .
the controversy stoked hostility towards the pope within the islamic world and even left staunch catholics aghast at their leader 's apparent insensitivity . controversy : part of the rhetorical process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer - another great talker but academics at the seminar for general rhetoric at tübingen university know a good speech when they see one , and recently named this now infamous regensburg talk their annual " speech of the year " - one they say was " deliberately misunderstood . " " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

roman rüdiger , managing director of the board of the violence prevention group , buddy , says it 's hard to tell if the amount of overall violence at schools across the country is really on the rise . what has changed is the " quality " of the violence , said rüdiger .
" the threshold is much lower than it used to be , and violence has become more brutal , more organized .
the old-fashioned playground scuffle has now been replaced with attacks which lead to grievous bodily harm , " he said .
what was once a rite of passage is now seen as the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable social behavior .
no manners , no values lars-oliver lück who heads the berlin & brandenburg anti-violence centre and who has extensive experience of trying to help youngsters back onto the straight and narrow , says the causes of today 's violence are manifold , but cites a combination of insufficient positive life experience and a lack of traditional values as two fundamental factors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people hanging out " you have all these children from underprivileged backgrounds who are emotionally neglected and frustrated .
when it comes down to it , they would rather be victimizers than victims , they would rather do the hitting than be hit , " lück said . " there used to be different values , but our society is too much of a gray zone nowadays .
children are no longer taught to be punctual or polite and many boys do n't have the positive male role model which they need for the development of their own self-perception . "
lück says the upshot is that young boys in particular , although he stresses that " girls are catching up , " make role models of gangster rappers or imaginary figures from the media , who give the impression that they achieve something through aggression .
" for kids who want social power and control , serious violent behavior is the way to achieve it , " said lück .
" they know no boundaries . "
happy slapping the advent of " happy slapping " is a case in point .
the violent import , in which random people are filmed on mobile phones as they are made the victims of unprovoked violent attacks , started in the uk in 2004 and has since made it into germany 's playgrounds .
although , as roman rüdiger points out , new generation mobile phone have not actually increased the incidence of violence , they are an added enticement for the violent-minded in that they offer them the chance to show off what they have done .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are indispensible for young people " for people who think violence is cool , it 's like recording their greatest moments , " says russell buckley who runs the mobhappy web site dedicated to mobile technology .
" but the technology is not to blame .
the violence was there before it came along , and this is just a different manifestation . "
nonetheless , it is another issue for schools to have to deal with .
many have already started implementing strict rules about phones on school premises , and some have launched campaigns for " clean cell phones . " but as lück says , it is unrealistic to expect teachers and directors to resolve the problems which started outside the school gates .
a different perception rüdiger , who has been active in trying to fight the culture of violence with one of peaceful coexistence in schools for several years , says what german school children really need is to learn how to learn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning to learn " things are changing rapidly , the knowledge we need today is different to the knowledge we will need in 10 years time .
with that in mind , we need to teach them to learn in order to give them some perspective . "
lück takes it one step further in suggesting that german society needs a complete rethink .

the move caused a storm of protest in a country already suffering from the highest energy prices in europe . germany ’ s leading energy companies appear bent on twisting the arm of chancellor angela merkel , using jobs and investments worth billions of euros as pawns in a power game with the eu . earlier this month the eu commission criticized germany 's plan for trading carbon dioxide emissions saying it would give german energy producers an unfair advantage in the emissions market . last week chancellor merkel ’ s cabinet reacted by raising the targets for overall emissions reduction as well as raising the prices for the emissions permits which industry can buy to allow them to produce carbon dioxide . ominous words from top four utility firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firms claim jobs will be lost if germany panders to the eu germany 's four leading utilities - rwe , e-on , enbw and vattenfall - are now threatening massive consequences if the plan goes through .
" if the demands raised by brussels are met , " said enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen , " it will become impossible to invest profitably in conventional power plants .
in other words , less energy will be produced , jobs will be cut and prices will go up . " the revised government plan is aimed at a substantial reduction of germany ’ s overall co2 emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 .
it now accepts the eu limit for germany of 453 million tons per year and that means a reduction of about 12 million tons compared to its original plan . in addition , energy producers will now have to pay for being allowed to pollute rather than receiving emissions trading permits for free . german economics minister michael glos on monday vowed to fight higher energy prices , by putting utilities on a tighter government leash if necessary . " the four biggest energy companies account for almost 90 percent of german energy generation , " he said .
" we need to look closer into their pricing policy now by strengthening cartel laws .
i ’ m sure this will benefit not only other companies but also individual consumers . " the controversial move is even supported by the pro-business opposition party , the liberal free democrats .
the party 's economics expert rainer brüderle said the government should remain steadfast in view of the demands by the energy producers . liberals call for an end to lobbying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says lobbyists should be ignored " the system of emissions trading is an effective mechanism to combine free market elements and climate protection , " brüderle said .
" the government should no longer allow special interests and lobby groups to interfere . " such interference however , is n't just a german problem .
the eu commission has criticized almost all of its member states for not being ambitious enough in their national emissions targets . the eu ’ s plan for the period from 2005 to 2007 almost collapsed when 2005 data showed that governments gave industry more emissions permits than needed , leading to a crash in carbon prices . under its commitment to the kyoto protocol , the 25-nation eu wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 levels .

authorities said no incidents were reported at the performance . plainclothes officers also mingled with the audience , who had to pass through airport-style metal detectors in the foyer . " we have never provided so much security for a performance of an opera , " said police spokesman bernhard schodrowski . the only demonstrations outside the building were in favor of freedom of expression . head scene met with mixed reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police were present around the opera house during the performance the staging of " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels culminates in a scene in which king idomeneo places the blood-spattered heads of the greek god poseidon , jesus , buddha and mohammed on four chairs . the appearance of the heads in monday 's performance was greeted by a ripple of applause , with several boos when the head of mohammed was brandished , according to audience reports . the opera house had pulled the performance from its scheduled november slots in september because of fears it could spark demonstrations by muslims angered by the depiction of mohammed . the manager of the opera house , kirsten harms , said she had acted on warnings from security officials .
the opera was rescheduled after police said there was no " concrete risk " to security . many observers , however , thought the decision to cancel smacked of giving in to extremists and censoring artistic expression after the uproar over cartoons of mohammed , which were first printed in a danish newspaper . attendance a political decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opera 's now infamous head scene elicited a mixed response from the audience the german government had hoped to present a united , multi-cultural front at the performance , but two leading muslim representatives turned down invitations to attend . ali kizilkaya , who leads the islamic council of germany , said he would not go because he feared the attendance of muslim leaders was being seen as a measure of how " integrated " they were in society . " it all seems to be done under the proviso that only those who go to the opera are integrated and those who do n't go are not , " he said . aiman mazyek , head of germany 's central council of muslims , said he did not want to become a " political pawn . " but the leader of the country 's turkish community , kenan kolat , was in the audience and criticized those who had stayed away . " i greatly regret that some leaders have not come , " he said .
" they have missed an opportunity to send a message to the whole of society . " kolat said art " must be free even if sometimes it is hard to accept . " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said he " respected " the muslim leaders who had refused to attend , but his ministry said earlier that nine of the 15 muslim representatives invited would be present . a second performance of the opera is scheduled for dec .

tübingen university has named its annual " speech of the year . "
this time , the honor goes to pope benedict 's controversial homily in regensburg , which outraged the muslim world in september . in the speech that went down in history as a milestone in cultural gaffes , the pope 's references to the teachings of a 14th century byzantine emperor unleashed a torrent of muslim fury . " show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached , " he quoted . the vatican stressed that the pontiff had simply meant to explore the historical and philosophical differences between islam and christianity and the relationship between violence and faith .
but his words caused grave offense across the globe .

" " our main criterion is how effective a speech was , " explained olaf kramer from the institute .
" we look at the ways in which a speech affected public debate and what sort of an international reaction it unleashed , whether it was positive or negative . " " this was a speech that really set a ball rolling , " he added .
" the discussion surrounding the pope 's visit to turkey in november was , in a way , a continuation of the same debate . " " further criteria taken into consideration are content , style and rhetoric , " points out kramer .
" obviously , we expect our decision this year to come in for a certain amount of criticism , but controversy is an integral part of a good speech because rhetoric is based on the taking of sides . " previous winners of the award , set up in 1998 , have included then foreign minister joschka fischer in 1999 - addressing the thorny issue of germany 's military involvement in the balkans - and journalist heribert prantl in 2004 on the rise of right-wing extremism . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 19.12.2006 europe condemns libya 's death penalty for foreign medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign medics have been imprisoned since 1999 european leaders are outraged after a libyan court sentenced five bulgarians nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for spreading the aids virus among children . the six medics were accused of infecting 426 children with hiv while they were working at al-fateh hospital in the libyan seaside city of benghazi , during the 1990s .
fifty three children have since died . bulgarian lawyer georgy gatev said from tripoli that the defense will appeal the ruling . bulgaria said it categorically rejected the " absurd " death sentences and called on the libyan authorities to intervene . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria 's president georgy parvanov called the sentence " absurd " " the whole court case was compromised and covers up the real cause that sparked the aids epidemics in benghazi , " said a joint statement by bulgarian president georgy parvanov and prime minister sergey stanishev . parvanov also called on the international community to reject the libyan decision . meanwhile , in the bulgarian capital sofia , parents and supporters of the five nurses launched a protest in front of the libyan embassy . eu shocked by verdict eu justice commissioner franco frattini also called for the verdict to be reviewed saying he was " shocked " by the decision . " i strongly hope that the libyan authorities will rethink this decision , " frattini said .
it poses " an obstacle to cooperation with the eu , " he added .
bulgaria is to join the european union on january 1 . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said it was " terrible to imagine how much horror the six medics have had to endure . " " this sentence further extends their martyrdom , " steinmeier said . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy joined the condemnations , saying he was " shocked " by the verdict .
he appealed to libyan judicial authorities for clemency for the six medics . the six , who were first detained in 1999 , had already been sentenced in may 2004 to face a firing squad but the supreme court then ordered a retrial following a december 2005 appeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans demonstrate their approval of the verdict in the case relatives of the victims carried portraits of dead or sick children outside the courthouse as security forces fired into the air to keep the crowds at bay . " why me ? " were the words on one picture .
" will i live for long ? " asked another . medical evidence supports innocence defence lawyers argued that the children had been infected with hiv - the virus that brings on acquired immune deficiency syndrome - before the nurses began working at the hospital . in november , the renowned british medical journal the lancet - in an editorial entitled " free the benghazi six " - blasted the retrial as a miscarriage of justice with " no legal foundation " . it cited independent scientific evidence that the infections were caused by bad hygiene at the benghazi hospital , and reports from human rights watchdogs that confessions had been extracted under torture . trial political minefield western trial observers say the foreigners are being used as scapegoats to cover up the negligence of libyan health authorities .
some analysts suspect libya is likely to keep the six as bargaining chips until talks yield a financial payout from the international community to appease the children 's families . libya has demanded 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.11 million -rrb- in compensation for each infected child 's family .

she had a son as a teenager but has been struggling for many years to have a second child .
eventually she travelled to istanbul for treatment .
i had my son when i was 14 , which was very young , and it was n't a happy time .
i did n't go to the antenatal clinic with the other ladies ; i went to the doctors at night when there was nobody there .
when i went to have my son in the maternity hospital i was in a side room out of the way .
everybody thought i was too young so my mother looked after him and i was sent back to school for my ' o ' levels .
i love him to bits , but i would like to have a happy , planned , pregnancy rather than an accident that everybody was embarrassed about .
determination drives me on - and my madness with the nhs fertility tourism boom ' we went to hollywood ' when i was 19 , i had a contraceptive coil fitted .
the doctor told me i would have a lot of pain but that was to be expected .
for about two or three months i was in agony .
i thought it would settle but eventually i could n't bear the pain any longer and i went to a well woman 's clinic .
they examined me and said the coil was not even in the right place and that i had an infection .
i had been trying to have a family and nothing was happening , so i was sent to hospital for a laparoscopy .
they said i had a really severe case of pelvic inflammatory disease , the worse they had seen .
they said that i would never become pregnant myself , i would need ivf , but i could n't go on the nhs-based list because i already had a child .
i felt like crying because my husband had n't got a family and i felt they were discriminating against him .
' i lied to the doctor ' three years later i was in a lecture about fertility and they said you could go on the list if you did n't have a child still living with you .
so i went back to the doctor and lied and said my son was no longer living with me , he was living with his grandmother .
' the sheer size of istanbul was a bit daunting but the people were kind ' i 'm quite sure the doctor was aware that i was lying but he said i could go on the list and i got my treatment after about a year .
the first time i tried ivf the pregnancy test was positive but then my period came .
the next two cycles were negative .
i decided that my chances were gone and i was going to stop .
but a few years later , when i was 34 , i thought , if i do n't do this now , i will regret it forever .
so i paid to have a fourth cycle of self-funding ivf treatment at an nhs hospital .
i got a positive result but a few days later i started bleeding .
i was back and forth to the hospital for two weeks getting blood tests and that was horrible because i was surrounded by ladies who were pregnant and were sailing through their treatment .
that was in june this year and it was then that i decided to go abroad .
over there they treat you as an individual ivf in barbados turning to the web i chose the american hospital of istanbul in turkey after reading a load of papers dr urman had written in medical journals .
it cost about the same , but they offer routine treatments that they do n't do in the uk .
' just a number ' over there they treat you as an individual ; over here you 're just a number .
i think the clinics are several years more advanced than in the uk and your treatment is more individualised .
i found the sheer size of istanbul a bit daunting but the people were kind and helpful .
i was treated in a beautiful , big , clean , modern hospital with all the latest technology .
but when i went for my first scan , they found that both of my fallopian tubes were filled with fluid and enlarged .
this fluid is toxic to embryos and they could n't believe i had been getting treatment in the uk without having them removed .
they said they were 98 % sure that this is what caused my miscarriage in june .
they did n't charge me a penny in istanbul ; they said it was too much of a disappointment for me going all that way for nothing .
but i had to pay nearly two grand for our flights and two weeks stay at the hotel .
' money wasted ' the hospital in scotland that had treated me in the past made me an appointment as soon as i came back .
i took my scan pictures home with me and when i showed them to the doctor he agreed that it looked like the same diagnosis .
but they scanned me twice and said they could n't see the fluid in my fallopian tubes .
' they said that i would never become pregnant myself , i would need ivf ' i asked for another scan , where they inject a dye into your fallopian tubes , but the doctor said it was a waste of time .
he said he would n't do the surgery to remove my damaged tubes as the procedure could be dangerous .
i have a plan b in place - i have been to my gp to ask to be referred to the gynaecology unit at another hospital urgently .
if i ca n't get to see the gynaecologist in the uk in the next few weeks , i have booked to go to kiev in the ukraine for the operation .
it is much cheaper ; it will cost £ 450 for the operation and £ 700 for ivf .
' postcode lottery ' my family are n't very happy about my decision to go there , especially my mother , who 's a nurse as well .
i am going to have to go on my own because i ca n't afford to take my husband because it will dip into the money i 've got for ivf .
they are going to try keyhole surgery but if it fails they will have to revert to open surgery and it 's a major operation .
i 'll be in hospital longer and i 'll be on my own ; it 's not something i 'm looking forward to .
i gave 17 years service as a nurse to the nhs and i feel really let down .
i do n't think i 'm asking for a lot to have my tubes removed , or even for them to look to see if they can remove them .
i can understand why a lot of money is n't ploughed into ivf because the nhs does n't have a lot of money and they 've got to prioritise where that money is spent but i still think that they are backwards in their treatment methods and it 's a postcode lottery for people to get ivf .
but determination drives me on , and my madness with the nhs .
i think it 's the thought that i 'm going to have a baby , i know i am .
i was pregnant in june and i 'm sure if it was n't for the operation i need , i would be pregnant now .

by helen briggs bbc news pregnancy , but at what cost ?
british couples are turning to the internet for information on where to get fertility treatment abroad .
in the absence of official advice , patients are using message boards on support websites such as fertility friends to select clinics .
according to guido pennings , of ghent university , belgium , the web is a key factor in the boom in ivf tourism .
but he said patients should be aware of ethical issues , amid concern over how some clinics are recruiting donors .
the professor of ethics and bioethics in the department of philosophy and moral science said there was " anecdotal evidence " that some clinics , particularly in eastern europe , were exploiting donors .
" they recruit even illiterate people who do n't know what they are going in for - clearly a violation of informed consent , " he said .
he warned that information on such things as success rates published on websites might not be reliable .
" there is no organisational state or department that is able to verify the information they provide , " he told the bbc news website .
uk rules in the uk , donors can not be paid for donating eggs or sperm but may claim for " all reasonable expenses " including travel , accommodation and childcare costs .
it 's not just giving a few body cells because if the treatment is successful those will grow up into children dr eric blyth , british association of social workers however , women are able to get subsidised ivf treatment , in exchange for donating eggs to other couples , or , in the case of one fertility centre in the north east , for research .
different rules apply worldwide .
women are paid around £ 420 in cyprus for their eggs but in the us figures range from £ 5,000 to £ 30,000 .
eric blyth , professor of social work at the university of huddersfield , uk , said young women may be " lured by what appear to be very large sums of money for what is being presented as a minor medical procedure " .
he said anyone considering going abroad for donor eggs should consider the impact on any future children .
" it 's not just giving a few body cells because if the treatment is successful those will grow up into children , " he told the bbc news website .

the lse made the comment as it set out its reasons to shareholders for rejecting the £ 2.7bn -lrb- $ 5.3bn -rrb- bid .
it said that last week 's offer from nasdaq had failed to reflect its " unique strategic position " .
the exchange also said that it was set to pay out a final dividend of at least 12 pence a share , up 50 % on last year .
the final date for shareholder acceptance of the nasdaq offer by lse shareholders is 11 january 2007 .
rejection urged in its statement , the lse said the takeover offer failed to reflect the quality of its business and its ability to " compete successfully in a fertile environment for highly efficient listing and trading platforms " .
it added that the offer was the lowest price that nasdaq could make under current takeover rules .

the lse also told investors that it expected earnings for the current financial year to rise by 58 % to 50.4 pence a share , while it expected to hand out a final dividend of no less than 12p a share - up 50 % on a year ago .
the lse has been fighting off a growing list if suitors in recent times .
in december 2004 , the lse rejected a takeover proposal from deutsche boerse which valued the london exchange at £ 1.35bn.

the final date for shareholder acceptance of the nasdaq offer by lse shareholders is 11 january 2007 .

the proceeds of the sale , which will lead to a one-off £ 100m gain in profits for the current financial year , will be used to reduce vodafone 's debts .
vodafone said the deal would have no material effect on mobile revenues , but it would no longer receive an expected £ 100m of dividends from swisscom .
vodafone also signed a new five-year deal with swisscom for its services .
under the new contract , vodafone will continue to supply its global products and services , including its vodafone live third-generation service and international roaming services .
tough market swisscom - which is 58 % owned by the swiss government - is battling increased competition and a drop in prices , making it hard for the firm to grow in its home market .
the deal is expected to boost swisscom 's annual profit by about 180m francs -lrb- $ 147.4m ; £ 75.3m a year from 2007 .
meanwhile , vodafone has been keen to pull out of markets with limited long-term commercial benefit .
in august , it sold its 25 % stake in the belgian mobile phone business proximus to belgacom for 2bn euros -lrb- £ 1.4bn -rrb- .
last year , it sold its japanese business for £ 8.9bn.

they argued that the move could be prejudicial if tom stephens was charged and the case went to trial .
but the deputy director of bbc news , adrian van klaveren , said he considered it to be " in the public interest " .
mr stephens had been interviewed in the days before his arrest by journalists from the bbc and the sunday mirror .
the supermarket worker is being held on suspicion of murdering prostitutes gemma adams , anneli alderton , tania nicol , paula clennell and annette nicholls .
editors ' blog we 're confident nothing we 've broadcast could prejudice a future trial adrian van-klaveren , deputy director bbc news read editors ' blog in full police have said their inquiries are ongoing .
christopher sallon qc said he felt the decision to broadcast the story was " absolutely wrong " on the grounds that " it is contrary to the contempt of court act " and " contrary to the spirit " of that legislation .
he told bbc two 's newsnight programme : " it -lsb- the broadcast -rsb- can only encourage speculation and in my view , having seen the interview , prejudice the trial . "
media organisations have to ensure coverage of criminal cases does not influence a future jury 's decision .
once proceedings become " active " , for example after someone has been arrested , care must be taken to avoid reporting anything which might create a " substantial risk of serious prejudice to a trial " .
' ethical issues ' defence lawyer julian young said such reporting " can be prejudicial " as the court may decide " there ca n't be a fair trial " .
" the ultimate public interest must be a fair trial , " he said .
however , mr van klaveren said the bbc did consider whether it " could be prejudicing any potential legal action " and decided that this " was not the case " .
juries are pretty robust joshua rozenberg legal editor , daily telegraph he said : " we then had to think about the ethical issues around actually deciding to release a conversation which had been done on a different basis .
" we felt in these very extraordinary and very rare circumstances there was actually a justification for doing that . "
daily telegraph legal editor joshua rozenberg said he thought that the amount of information put in the public domain should not have a great impact on any future trial .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " juries are pretty robust , and they 're always told to forget anything they may have read in the press , and the trial these days is usually up to a year after somebody is arrested .
" but if there has been a huge amount of publicity , cumulative publicity , and something unusual like an interview , or lots of photographs , then it might be quite difficult for the jury to ignore that and the impression it creates . "
' sea change ' former gloucestershire chief constable tony butler said the media 's appetite for information during a major criminal investigation could damage the prospect of a conviction .
his force investigated the gloucester murders committed by fred and rosemary west , but was unable to call some witnesses who had sold their stories to the press .
" this case hopefully will be resolved in the courts , by a jury having sufficient evidence to conclude that the individual in the dock did in fact commit the murders ... and you ca n't jeopardise that at any stage , " he told today .
lawyer mark stephens told newsnight that the changing nature of the media , and the way in which public access information , should be considered .
he said there had been " a sea change in the way in which we look at the media " which meant " we no longer take the bbc as writ " .
" people actually interact with the media now .
they go on the internet ... people actually try to investigate .
" there has been a fundamental change .

dr saukko added : " for the first time we are going to investigate what the public is being told by commercial companies and the scientists themselves .

she said an analysis was needed so a " threshold " could be drawn setting down what should and should not be sold to the public .
