what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2006 " she needs to reorient the ' strategic partnership " ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald leibrecht , parliamentarian from the free-market , liberal fdp party angela merkel travels to moscow monday to meet with vladimir putin .
dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.01.2006 debate resurfaces over excluding iran from soccer world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the cheer from iran 's fans turn to anger before the world cup ?
iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup .

german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .

even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .

" fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2006 stable relationship with russia a priority for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir putin and angela merkel have yet to define their relationship on the heels of her first trip to washington as chancellor , angela merkel embarks on a similar official visit to russia monday , where she will meet with president vladimir putin .
what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.01.2006 hackers : if you ca n't beat ' em , recruit ' em großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer crime is booming right along with the internet 's growth in the days of increased reliance on the internet , hackers are making computers increasingly unsafe .
to counter that , it security firms are turning around and hiring talented hackers to find security system holes . sebastian schreiber 's face lights up with a mischievous grin and his eyes gleam with excitement as he talks about computer hack attacks . " cross side scripting or sql injection attacks - these are really clever , " said the man some describe as one of germany 's leading hired hackers .
" it 's fascinating to cheat computer systems , to break into systems to identify security holes and to demonstrate to our customers that we 're able to compromise their systems . " the 34-year-old is not a criminal hacker , but a so-called hired hacker .
and he 's been breaking into computer systems for the better part of 20 years .
at the age of 11 , he got his first computer .
one year later , he started writing his first hacker scripts - all of that long before the advent of the internet . ironically , his father is a judge - and maybe that 's what tipped schreiber towards hacking within the boundaries of the law . hacking into client servers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some hackers now receive a paycheck instead of jail sentences today he heads syss - one of germany 's top it security firms .
he created the business seven years ago while still a computer science student .
these days , his clients include some of the world 's biggest companies , including daimlerchrysler , sap , deutsche bank , ibm , the european central bank and the european commission . " they want to protect their systems against attacks from spies , against espionage , against those who break into the system and sell information , for example , to competitors , " he said .
" and they want to protect their systems against internet worms or viruses . " to protect his clients from the murky cyber world of hackers , schreiber and his team conduct penetration tests - or so-called pen tests .
this means they actually try to attack the internet sites and the computer systems of their clients . find weaknesses the first part of their mission is to identify weaknesses on the clients ' web page .
then it gets more hands on .
with the help of their hacker laptops , they go to the company , log in to their network and check how easily they can access secret corporate information . " sometimes we do n't know where the servers are located , for example when we do the pen tests for sap - we attack all the systems they have in the internet - we attack dozens of countries , " schreiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased reliance on the internet also threatens users ' security sometimes they hack attack more than 1,000 servers at the same time - and he says those attacks can get really complicated .
off-the-shelf software simply ca n't do the job . " these attacks are really clever , " said schreiber .
" we ca n't do them with software .
we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .
we have to write attacks for only one use . " and like anything in the it world , a hack attack does n't come cheap .
schreiber charges 1,300 euros a day , and an attack can last anywhere between two days and two months . not average 9 to 5 job it 's also definitely not an average 9 to 5 job .
coffee as you 'd imagine keeps many of the hired hackers fuelled ; adrenaline does the rest . " usually my employees who are about to get into a system wo n't go home at five o 'clock in the afternoon but will stay until they crack the system . " schreiber calls it " jagdtrieb , " or the hunting instinct .
it 's an amazing feeling he says and it never wears off because every hack is different - not to mention the information they find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackers are increasingly joining cyber activists in advocating for increased security " all kinds of information , for example bank account information , lists of passwords , health information , confidential information in research and development , " he said .
" we can get all the company secrets that you can imagine . " and what do they do with this information ? " of course we do n't take a close look at the data - we only take a few lines in order to demonstrate that we have been able to download the information , " he said .
" we stop reading when we find out that the information is really confidential . " that 's also why the office has a special shredder for all this top-secret information , a good thing for his customers and their clients .
one of schreiber 's biggest hacker successes was penetrating one of germany 's biggest banks . " we were able to get into the accounting system of the bank , " he said .
" so we could see all the customer data , all account data , we saw everything , the transactions , that was really interesting and from a technical point of view it was quite clever to get into the system . " mixing with the low in order to keep up-to-date , schreiber and his team regularly join hacker conventions , internet chats and go underground for the latest tips , tricks and tactics .
but to what extent should hired hackers like them mingle with those on the wrong side of information highway ? " that 's a conflict .
on the one hand our customers do n't want us to have contact to the dark side , on the other hand our customers want us to have all the latest information before it 's published on the internet and that 's not possible , " schreiber said .
" it 's a dangerous situation .
we need the contact , but we do n't want the contact . " so what is the solution ?
contact , but not friendship , he says . despite all the efforts , the dark side remains a step ahead most of the time .
after all , there are thousands of hackers all over the world with loads of time on their hands to hack as a hobby . hired hackers however are very much in demand - as long as they do n't have a criminal record .
schreiber is even running a competition called " capture the job " in which he asks young hackers to attack one of their systems at www.syss.de although now schreiber is a master corporate hacker , that does n't mean he 's not interesting in future challenges . " maybe i 'd like to do a project for the national security agency in the united states .
that would be a real challenge , " he said . barbara gruber -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany 's it branch defenseless ?

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2006 stable relationship with russia a priority for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir putin and angela merkel have yet to define their relationship on the heels of her first trip to washington as chancellor , angela merkel embarks on a similar official visit to russia monday , where she will meet with president vladimir putin .
what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

12 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : more information on iran , please !
iran has resumed its nuclear power program .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

to counter that , it security firms are turning around and hiring talented hackers to find security system holes . sebastian schreiber 's face lights up with a mischievous grin and his eyes gleam with excitement as he talks about computer hack attacks . " cross side scripting or sql injection attacks - these are really clever , " said the man some describe as one of germany 's leading hired hackers .
" it 's fascinating to cheat computer systems , to break into systems to identify security holes and to demonstrate to our customers that we 're able to compromise their systems . " the 34-year-old is not a criminal hacker , but a so-called hired hacker .
and he 's been breaking into computer systems for the better part of 20 years .
at the age of 11 , he got his first computer .
one year later , he started writing his first hacker scripts - all of that long before the advent of the internet . ironically , his father is a judge - and maybe that 's what tipped schreiber towards hacking within the boundaries of the law . hacking into client servers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some hackers now receive a paycheck instead of jail sentences today he heads syss - one of germany 's top it security firms .
he created the business seven years ago while still a computer science student .
these days , his clients include some of the world 's biggest companies , including daimlerchrysler , sap , deutsche bank , ibm , the european central bank and the european commission . " they want to protect their systems against attacks from spies , against espionage , against those who break into the system and sell information , for example , to competitors , " he said .
" and they want to protect their systems against internet worms or viruses . " to protect his clients from the murky cyber world of hackers , schreiber and his team conduct penetration tests - or so-called pen tests .
this means they actually try to attack the internet sites and the computer systems of their clients . find weaknesses the first part of their mission is to identify weaknesses on the clients ' web page .
then it gets more hands on .
with the help of their hacker laptops , they go to the company , log in to their network and check how easily they can access secret corporate information . " sometimes we do n't know where the servers are located , for example when we do the pen tests for sap - we attack all the systems they have in the internet - we attack dozens of countries , " schreiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased reliance on the internet also threatens users ' security sometimes they hack attack more than 1,000 servers at the same time - and he says those attacks can get really complicated .
off-the-shelf software simply ca n't do the job . " these attacks are really clever , " said schreiber .
" we ca n't do them with software .
we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .
we have to write attacks for only one use . " and like anything in the it world , a hack attack does n't come cheap .
schreiber charges 1,300 euros a day , and an attack can last anywhere between two days and two months . not average 9 to 5 job it 's also definitely not an average 9 to 5 job .
coffee as you 'd imagine keeps many of the hired hackers fuelled ; adrenaline does the rest . " usually my employees who are about to get into a system wo n't go home at five o 'clock in the afternoon but will stay until they crack the system . " schreiber calls it " jagdtrieb , " or the hunting instinct .
it 's an amazing feeling he says and it never wears off because every hack is different - not to mention the information they find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackers are increasingly joining cyber activists in advocating for increased security " all kinds of information , for example bank account information , lists of passwords , health information , confidential information in research and development , " he said .
" we can get all the company secrets that you can imagine . " and what do they do with this information ? " of course we do n't take a close look at the data - we only take a few lines in order to demonstrate that we have been able to download the information , " he said .
" we stop reading when we find out that the information is really confidential . " that 's also why the office has a special shredder for all this top-secret information , a good thing for his customers and their clients .
one of schreiber 's biggest hacker successes was penetrating one of germany 's biggest banks . " we were able to get into the accounting system of the bank , " he said .
" so we could see all the customer data , all account data , we saw everything , the transactions , that was really interesting and from a technical point of view it was quite clever to get into the system . " mixing with the low in order to keep up-to-date , schreiber and his team regularly join hacker conventions , internet chats and go underground for the latest tips , tricks and tactics .
but to what extent should hired hackers like them mingle with those on the wrong side of information highway ? " that 's a conflict .
on the one hand our customers do n't want us to have contact to the dark side , on the other hand our customers want us to have all the latest information before it 's published on the internet and that 's not possible , " schreiber said .
" it 's a dangerous situation .
we need the contact , but we do n't want the contact . " so what is the solution ?
contact , but not friendship , he says . despite all the efforts , the dark side remains a step ahead most of the time .
after all , there are thousands of hackers all over the world with loads of time on their hands to hack as a hobby . hired hackers however are very much in demand - as long as they do n't have a criminal record .
schreiber is even running a competition called " capture the job " in which he asks young hackers to attack one of their systems at www.syss.de although now schreiber is a master corporate hacker , that does n't mean he 's not interesting in future challenges . " maybe i 'd like to do a project for the national security agency in the united states .
that would be a real challenge , " he said . barbara gruber -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany 's it branch defenseless ?

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2006 " she needs to reorient the ' strategic partnership " ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald leibrecht , parliamentarian from the free-market , liberal fdp party angela merkel travels to moscow monday to meet with vladimir putin .
dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2006 " she needs to reorient the ' strategic partnership " ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald leibrecht , parliamentarian from the free-market , liberal fdp party angela merkel travels to moscow monday to meet with vladimir putin .
dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .

fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.01.2006 stable relationship with russia a priority for merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir putin and angela merkel have yet to define their relationship on the heels of her first trip to washington as chancellor , angela merkel embarks on a similar official visit to russia monday , where she will meet with president vladimir putin .
what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .
russia 's close partnership with germany has already helped putin a good deal ; in 2006 his country holds the chair of the g-8 group of states . ingo mannteufel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gazprom on offensive in ' gas war ' with ukraine the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has had a chilling effect on europe as a result of the continent 's reliance on russia 's gas monopoly gazprom .

what are the expectations of the visit ? the talks between the russian and german leaders scheduled for monday are approaching with a certain amount of suspense .
not only was her predecessor , gerhard schröder , one of russian staunchest advocates on the world stage , but he and putin were also close personal friends .
schröder refused to raise even the slightest objection to any of putin 's controversial domestic policies over the years . at the time , schröder came under heavy criticism for that from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who were then in the opposition .
for that reason , before last fall 's federal elections , many feared that relations with russia would suffer under a government led by the cdu 's angela merkel .
now that germany has such a government , all eyes will be trained on how merkel and putin hit it off during this first official meeting . no drastic change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin were two old pals , or they at least acted that way all the signs up to now suggest that german-russian relations under chancellor merkel will change only slightly .
naturally the carefully maintained image of two buddies , " gerd " and " volodya , " having a grand old time together , will change .
even though , angela merkel does have the potential to put her own stamp on meetings with putin thanks to her knowledge of russian . merkel made it clear in an interview published in the newsweekly spiegel that she wants to continue germany 's " strategic partnership " with russia .
she , however , could not describe the relationship as a " friendship " as long as there were so few shared values concerning democracy . behind this nuanced and skillful differentiation between " strategic partnership " and " friendship " lies the merkel 's goal , the stabilization of russian relations .
evidently the chancellor does not want to risk a drastic reversal in berlin 's ties to moscow , russia 's importance regarding issues like iran 's nuclear program or even the security of europe 's energy supplies are too important . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's huge energy reserves give it clout , which makes some people uneasy for good reason , the russian market continues to be attractive to german companies .
the expansion of trade relations between germany and russia is likely be a topic close to the top of the agenda during the talks in moscow . at the same time , there are plenty of sensitive subjects between the two countries : the war in chechnya , putin 's authoritarian tendencies , reservations about the independence of the judiciary as shown by the khordokovsky case , the issue of art stolen in wartime and russia 's support of iran 's nuclear program .
merkel knows that these problems will not go away on their own . that has much to do with russia 's current leadership , which because of its own conception of itself , overflowing state coffers and a raft of positive economic indicators has little interest in outside criticism .
merkel will likely address german concerns over some political developments in russia through symbolic gestures , for example the planned meeting with kremlin critics .
overly loud criticism , which could endanger berlin-moscow ties , will be avoided . how will putin react ? president putin is a pragmatic politician .
a german policy toward russia which makes a semantic difference between a " strategic partnership " and " friendship " is not likely to make him happy , but he can live with it .
beyond the choice of words , germany 's readiness for a strategic partnership is actually in line with putin 's own foreign policy goals : to integrate russia into the global economy as a energy superpower .

dw-world spoke with harald leibrecht , free democrat parliamentarian and member of the foreign affairs committee , about the german-russian relationship . dw-world : former chancellor schröder was one of russia 's strongest advocates .
what do you expect from chancellor merkel regarding german-russian relations ?
in your opinion , should angela merkel address sensitive areas of the relationship more than gerhard schröder did ? harald leibrecht : on the latter question , you will get an unqualified " yes " from me .
ms. merkel most definitely has to address these topics .
above all , she needs to reorient the " strategic partnership " with russia , away from the " buddy " model à la kohl and schröder , and toward an open dialog , one which allows criticism . for me , " partnership " means the connection of two partners in a special way .
this " special connection " between russia and germany is there due to many reasons : common interests , and especially economic interests , although not exclusively so .
there are security issues , such as the war against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons on mass destruction , where germany and russia are headed in the same direction . in a real partnership it has to be possible to discuss the existing differences and problems .
these differences will russia i think are primarily in the areas of the understanding of democracy and the rule of law . what do you think about chancellor merkel 's describing the relationship to the us , because of the two countries ' shared values , as a " friendship " and calling the relationship to russia a " strategic partnership " due to shared economic interests ? our connection to the us is a deeply rooted , decades-long friendship .
shared values and a commitment to democracy in a free society are the firm foundations of our friendship .
that kind of a friendship with russia has yet to form .
in any case , it will not ever be a friendship such as the one the gdr and the soviet union had , which was " decreed from above " by both governments . friendship can only be built on the basis of common interests and values and if both parties want it .
as soon as all the russian government 's talk about freedom and democracy becomes more than just lip service , than the door to a real friendship will be open . the row between russia and ukraine over natural gas has made the question of the reliability of european and german energy supplies and the dependence on russian energy clearer than ever . it is always problematic , to concentrate solely on one partner .
that can quickly turn into dependence .
the russian example shows how important it is to have a wide-ranging energy mix in germany , comprising fossil fuels , renewables and also nuclear energy . the federal government needs to do everything possible to reduce this energy dependence , thereby guaranteeing the reliability of supplies while increasing efficiency and reducing subsidies . how do you and the fdp , now the largest opposition group in parliament , the future of german-russia relations ?
what would an fdp foreign minister in a coalition with the conservatives do differently ? german-russia relations are for both me and the fdp very important .
russia is not only an important economic partner , but has an effect of global politics that can not be underestimated .
it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .

it 's important for the partnership with russia to be put on a foundation that is stable in the long term , not one which depends on personal relationships , but which is based on common interests and values ; it 's not enough that the two heads of state get along famously . there must be much more exchange and a willingness to learn from one another , on different levels of society , particularly on the level of civil society .
there are many things that connect russia and germany .
these connections must be reactivated and expanded . ingo mannteufel spoke with harald leibrecht send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gas delivery dispute hits eu because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

" they want to protect their systems against attacks from spies , against espionage , against those who break into the system and sell information , for example , to competitors , " he said .
" and they want to protect their systems against internet worms or viruses . " to protect his clients from the murky cyber world of hackers , schreiber and his team conduct penetration tests - or so-called pen tests .
this means they actually try to attack the internet sites and the computer systems of their clients . find weaknesses the first part of their mission is to identify weaknesses on the clients ' web page .
then it gets more hands on .
with the help of their hacker laptops , they go to the company , log in to their network and check how easily they can access secret corporate information . " sometimes we do n't know where the servers are located , for example when we do the pen tests for sap - we attack all the systems they have in the internet - we attack dozens of countries , " schreiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased reliance on the internet also threatens users ' security sometimes they hack attack more than 1,000 servers at the same time - and he says those attacks can get really complicated .
off-the-shelf software simply ca n't do the job . " these attacks are really clever , " said schreiber .
" we ca n't do them with software .
we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .
we have to write attacks for only one use . " and like anything in the it world , a hack attack does n't come cheap .
schreiber charges 1,300 euros a day , and an attack can last anywhere between two days and two months . not average 9 to 5 job it 's also definitely not an average 9 to 5 job .

off-the-shelf software simply ca n't do the job . " these attacks are really clever , " said schreiber .
" we ca n't do them with software .
we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .

we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .
we have to write attacks for only one use . " and like anything in the it world , a hack attack does n't come cheap .
schreiber charges 1,300 euros a day , and an attack can last anywhere between two days and two months . not average 9 to 5 job it 's also definitely not an average 9 to 5 job .
coffee as you 'd imagine keeps many of the hired hackers fuelled ; adrenaline does the rest . " usually my employees who are about to get into a system wo n't go home at five o 'clock in the afternoon but will stay until they crack the system .

it 's an amazing feeling he says and it never wears off because every hack is different - not to mention the information they find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackers are increasingly joining cyber activists in advocating for increased security " all kinds of information , for example bank account information , lists of passwords , health information , confidential information in research and development , " he said .
" we can get all the company secrets that you can imagine . " and what do they do with this information ? " of course we do n't take a close look at the data - we only take a few lines in order to demonstrate that we have been able to download the information , " he said .
" we stop reading when we find out that the information is really confidential . " that 's also why the office has a special shredder for all this top-secret information , a good thing for his customers and their clients .
one of schreiber 's biggest hacker successes was penetrating one of germany 's biggest banks . " we were able to get into the accounting system of the bank , " he said .
" so we could see all the customer data , all account data , we saw everything , the transactions , that was really interesting and from a technical point of view it was quite clever to get into the system . " mixing with the low in order to keep up-to-date , schreiber and his team regularly join hacker conventions , internet chats and go underground for the latest tips , tricks and tactics .
but to what extent should hired hackers like them mingle with those on the wrong side of information highway ? " that 's a conflict .
on the one hand our customers do n't want us to have contact to the dark side , on the other hand our customers want us to have all the latest information before it 's published on the internet and that 's not possible , " schreiber said .
" it 's a dangerous situation .
we need the contact , but we do n't want the contact . " so what is the solution ?
contact , but not friendship , he says . despite all the efforts , the dark side remains a step ahead most of the time .
after all , there are thousands of hackers all over the world with loads of time on their hands to hack as a hobby . hired hackers however are very much in demand - as long as they do n't have a criminal record .
schreiber is even running a competition called " capture the job " in which he asks young hackers to attack one of their systems at www.syss.de although now schreiber is a master corporate hacker , that does n't mean he 's not interesting in future challenges .

to counter that , it security firms are turning around and hiring talented hackers to find security system holes . sebastian schreiber 's face lights up with a mischievous grin and his eyes gleam with excitement as he talks about computer hack attacks . " cross side scripting or sql injection attacks - these are really clever , " said the man some describe as one of germany 's leading hired hackers .
" it 's fascinating to cheat computer systems , to break into systems to identify security holes and to demonstrate to our customers that we 're able to compromise their systems . " the 34-year-old is not a criminal hacker , but a so-called hired hacker .
and he 's been breaking into computer systems for the better part of 20 years .
at the age of 11 , he got his first computer .
one year later , he started writing his first hacker scripts - all of that long before the advent of the internet . ironically , his father is a judge - and maybe that 's what tipped schreiber towards hacking within the boundaries of the law . hacking into client servers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some hackers now receive a paycheck instead of jail sentences today he heads syss - one of germany 's top it security firms .
he created the business seven years ago while still a computer science student .
these days , his clients include some of the world 's biggest companies , including daimlerchrysler , sap , deutsche bank , ibm , the european central bank and the european commission . " they want to protect their systems against attacks from spies , against espionage , against those who break into the system and sell information , for example , to competitors , " he said .
" and they want to protect their systems against internet worms or viruses . " to protect his clients from the murky cyber world of hackers , schreiber and his team conduct penetration tests - or so-called pen tests .
this means they actually try to attack the internet sites and the computer systems of their clients . find weaknesses the first part of their mission is to identify weaknesses on the clients ' web page .
then it gets more hands on .
with the help of their hacker laptops , they go to the company , log in to their network and check how easily they can access secret corporate information . " sometimes we do n't know where the servers are located , for example when we do the pen tests for sap - we attack all the systems they have in the internet - we attack dozens of countries , " schreiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased reliance on the internet also threatens users ' security sometimes they hack attack more than 1,000 servers at the same time - and he says those attacks can get really complicated .
off-the-shelf software simply ca n't do the job . " these attacks are really clever , " said schreiber .
" we ca n't do them with software .
we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .

dw-world talked to him about his expectations and germany 's future human rights policy . tom koenigs has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid at the foreign ministry since 2005 .
previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

previously he served as director of the un observer mission in guatemala and helped push forward the peace process after the civil war that lasted from 1969 to 1996 .
he also helped set up kosovo 's new civil administration for the united nations .
in december 2005 , un secretary general kofi annan appointed the green party politician as the new un special envoy for afghanistan .
koenigs succeeds jean arnauld from france , who has held the position since february 2004 .
he will start his new job on feb .
15 , when he will travel to afghanistan for the first time .
it 's still unclear whether the german government will replace him . dw-world : what do you expect from the afghanistan conference in london at the end of january ?
do you think countries that have been supporting afghanistan so far will retract their aid ?
tom koenigs : i do n't think so , since the commitments have been quite clear .
the international community 's experience with short-term support in the region was such that people said that only long-term and reliable aid will bring the desired stability . the afghan government has to be able to rely on the international community as a long-term partner .
otherwise alliances that are formed will remain fragile .
do you see iraq becoming a competitor , with aid for afghanistan being diverted to iraq ?
i do n't think so .
there are many poor states and the international community , especially the well-off parts , will have to get used to the fact that truly effective aid is only possible through long-term engagement - that short-term help is a flash in the pan that 's harmful rather than beneficial for some countries . bildunterschrift : much remains to be done in rebuilding afghanistan reconstruction help in afghanistan has been seen as long-term from the beginning .
i believe that the international community will have to brace itself for a long presence - in terms of economic , security and good governance issues .
afghanistan is a country where short-term intervention in the form of money , arms deliveries and troops has taken place in the past . they all failed , because the necessary reliability was missing , because no attention was paid to the needs of afghans and the way they want to govern themselves .
what are your biggest goals as special envoy ?
what are you planning to do ?
the goals have n't changed .
the most important thing is to get stability in the region through cooperation with the government .
that the government decides what gets done and who is involved . of course , i am expecting an improvement in terms of efficiency of government institutions and modernization .
of course , economic development is hugely important in one of the world 's poorest countries .
still , you ca n't have the same expectations that one would have with a country such as switzerland . afghanistan is a country with an extremely high illiteracy rate , a very low average income and immense poverty .
if it were possible to reach at least some of the millennium goals by 2015 - the afghan government has said it will manage by 2020 - i would say that it 's been worth the effort .
and that it 's worth continuing .
how do you feel about your time as the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid ?
what are you proud of ?
first off , i 'm convinced that this relatively new office is an important one .
it 's important that there is a place where human rights policy is the focus of attention - also within the foreign ministry .
i 've worked well with germany 's civil society and non-governmental organizations .
it 's an important liaison function .
the government has to listen to these organizations . it was also important for me to talk to people responsible for human rights in embassies about this topic as well as putting them in touch with defenders of human rights in the country or strengthening existing contacts .
i think this is an ongoing obligation , to discuss human rights in german embassies and to make it clear to the countries where german diplomats are accredited that human rights are a central issue for germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be respected even in the fight against terrorism we 've also introduced new topics this year .
one is the human right to water , which will be pursued by the federal government .
the other - which is currently a hot-button issue - is the topic of human rights in connection with the fight against terrorism .
it 's a continuing topic and will remain so .
i hope that the public will remain focused on this .
the federal government has defined this more clearly and that 's something i 'm happy about - without wanting to take sole credit for it myself .
what can your successor expect ?
what needs to be done ?
unfortunately human rights will continue to be violated in various parts of the world .
i expect my successor to listen to victims of these human rights abuses and to put the rights and claims of victims first when assessing human rights violations .

to counter that , it security firms are turning around and hiring talented hackers to find security system holes . sebastian schreiber 's face lights up with a mischievous grin and his eyes gleam with excitement as he talks about computer hack attacks . " cross side scripting or sql injection attacks - these are really clever , " said the man some describe as one of germany 's leading hired hackers .
" it 's fascinating to cheat computer systems , to break into systems to identify security holes and to demonstrate to our customers that we 're able to compromise their systems . " the 34-year-old is not a criminal hacker , but a so-called hired hacker .
and he 's been breaking into computer systems for the better part of 20 years .
at the age of 11 , he got his first computer .
one year later , he started writing his first hacker scripts - all of that long before the advent of the internet . ironically , his father is a judge - and maybe that 's what tipped schreiber towards hacking within the boundaries of the law . hacking into client servers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some hackers now receive a paycheck instead of jail sentences today he heads syss - one of germany 's top it security firms .
he created the business seven years ago while still a computer science student .
these days , his clients include some of the world 's biggest companies , including daimlerchrysler , sap , deutsche bank , ibm , the european central bank and the european commission . " they want to protect their systems against attacks from spies , against espionage , against those who break into the system and sell information , for example , to competitors , " he said .
" and they want to protect their systems against internet worms or viruses . " to protect his clients from the murky cyber world of hackers , schreiber and his team conduct penetration tests - or so-called pen tests .
this means they actually try to attack the internet sites and the computer systems of their clients . find weaknesses the first part of their mission is to identify weaknesses on the clients ' web page .
then it gets more hands on .
with the help of their hacker laptops , they go to the company , log in to their network and check how easily they can access secret corporate information . " sometimes we do n't know where the servers are located , for example when we do the pen tests for sap - we attack all the systems they have in the internet - we attack dozens of countries , " schreiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased reliance on the internet also threatens users ' security sometimes they hack attack more than 1,000 servers at the same time - and he says those attacks can get really complicated .
off-the-shelf software simply ca n't do the job . " these attacks are really clever , " said schreiber .
" we ca n't do them with software .
we have to do them manually .
we have to write our own attack scripts and every attack is different .
we have to write attacks for only one use . " and like anything in the it world , a hack attack does n't come cheap .
schreiber charges 1,300 euros a day , and an attack can last anywhere between two days and two months . not average 9 to 5 job it 's also definitely not an average 9 to 5 job .
coffee as you 'd imagine keeps many of the hired hackers fuelled ; adrenaline does the rest . " usually my employees who are about to get into a system wo n't go home at five o 'clock in the afternoon but will stay until they crack the system . " schreiber calls it " jagdtrieb , " or the hunting instinct .
it 's an amazing feeling he says and it never wears off because every hack is different - not to mention the information they find . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackers are increasingly joining cyber activists in advocating for increased security " all kinds of information , for example bank account information , lists of passwords , health information , confidential information in research and development , " he said .
" we can get all the company secrets that you can imagine . " and what do they do with this information ? " of course we do n't take a close look at the data - we only take a few lines in order to demonstrate that we have been able to download the information , " he said .
" we stop reading when we find out that the information is really confidential . " that 's also why the office has a special shredder for all this top-secret information , a good thing for his customers and their clients .
one of schreiber 's biggest hacker successes was penetrating one of germany 's biggest banks . " we were able to get into the accounting system of the bank , " he said .
" so we could see all the customer data , all account data , we saw everything , the transactions , that was really interesting and from a technical point of view it was quite clever to get into the system . " mixing with the low in order to keep up-to-date , schreiber and his team regularly join hacker conventions , internet chats and go underground for the latest tips , tricks and tactics .
but to what extent should hired hackers like them mingle with those on the wrong side of information highway ? " that 's a conflict .
on the one hand our customers do n't want us to have contact to the dark side , on the other hand our customers want us to have all the latest information before it 's published on the internet and that 's not possible , " schreiber said .
" it 's a dangerous situation .
we need the contact , but we do n't want the contact . " so what is the solution ?
contact , but not friendship , he says . despite all the efforts , the dark side remains a step ahead most of the time .
after all , there are thousands of hackers all over the world with loads of time on their hands to hack as a hobby . hired hackers however are very much in demand - as long as they do n't have a criminal record .
schreiber is even running a competition called " capture the job " in which he asks young hackers to attack one of their systems at www.syss.de although now schreiber is a master corporate hacker , that does n't mean he 's not interesting in future challenges . " maybe i 'd like to do a project for the national security agency in the united states .
that would be a real challenge , " he said . barbara gruber -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany 's it branch defenseless ?

iran 's behavior of late has outraged many in the international community .
some are saying the country should be excluded from the soccer world cup .
soccer 's governing body fifa does n't agree . the extremist views and words of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has had some politicians in germany and abroad calling for iran 's exclusion from the soccer world cup , which takes place in germany this summer .
the deepening row over the country 's nuclear program has those calls going out again . in december , several green party politicians called for action to be taken against iran for publicly denying the holocaust and calling for the destruction of israel .
the head of the parliamentary group of the green party in the european parliament , daniel cohn-bendit , said excluding iran would be a good way to isolate the country internationally . also in december , angelika beer , a european green parliamentarian , said that a country with such a president " has no business at the world cup . "
volker beck , the party 's parliamentary group leader in germany , also spoke of iranian actions that " can not go without consequences . " more recently in germany , an official with the protestant church , nikolaus schneider , advocated iran 's exclusion from the tournament , saying it was unacceptable for germany to welcome a team from a nation whose government advocates the destruction of israel . calls outside of germany the latest , quickly escalating crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , which many in the west would like to quell , has convinced some others in germany and abroad that one strategy to get iran to take notice of the international community 's concerns would be to lock it out of soccer 's biggest event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran -lrb- in white -rrb- would like to prove their qualities on the pitch to germany 's north , the small danish socialist people 's party , which holds 11 of 179 seats in parliament , has urged the country 's foreign minister per stig moeller to bring up the matter to his colleagues .
in the uk , michael ancram , a conservative parliamentarian , said he believed that preventing the country from taking part in the world cup would " send a very clear signal " to tehran that the international community will not tolerate its nuclear ambitions .
he suggested in an interview that world cup expulsion would have a significant impact on public opinion in iran and could persuade the government to curtail nuclear testing .
german government not for ban but the german and british governments appear to be of a different opinion . chancellor angela merkel said earlier this month that alternative sanctions , such as the exclusion of iran from the world cup this summer , would not be the appropriate means to compel president ahmadinejad to negotiate with the international community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad 's talk about holocaust " myth " has outraged many germany 's coalition of christian and social democrats has not called for iran to be banned from the world cup . in britain , foreign secretary jack straw has cautioned against the expulsion of iran from the world cup as punishment , saying he was " not certain " that such a sanction against iran would be helpful . fifa not in hurry to exclude iran shortly after the group drawings last month , andreas herren , a spokesman for the soccer 's world governing body , iterated that his organization had no intentions to uninvited the iranians . " fifa strictly separates sports from politics , " he said then .
more recently , fifa spokesman john schumacher told bbc radio : " fifa is a sporting organization and not a political one . "
" each side are representatives of their respective football associations and can not be held responsible for views expressed by their own governments , " he said .
yet fifa would by no means be treading new waters if it considered expelling the asian participant from the competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president blatter is n't interested in punishing iran 's team because of its government in 1992 , the soccer european governing body uefa shut out former yugoslavia from participating in the european cup in sweden .
fifa also prevented what remained of yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , from taking part in the qualifications for the 1994 world cup . before those suspensions however , the un security council obligated national governments not to allow yugoslavian sports teams competing in international events .
without such explicit instructions from the un , it seems unlikely that fifa president sepp blatter will change his tune . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans agree to refer iran to un security council the eu-3 negotiations team dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis agreed thursday that an emergency meeting of the un iaea watchdog should be convened with a view to bringing iran before the un security council .

port authorities in falmouth are looking at plans which could see huge oil tankers moving oil from one vessel to another .
the port authority believes falmouth could be well suited to this practice which is common place in other parts of the world .
if it gets the go ahead it would almost double the ports annual turn over , but environmental groups and local authorities say the risks of such activities in such an environmentally sensitive area are simply to high .
falmouth is known for a beautiful coastline and nearby conservation areas which are home to many rare species of wildlife .
but it is also a busy industrial port .
the docks are the towns biggest employer and the economic benefit of allowing ship to ship oil transfers is an opportunity the harbour authority says it simply can not ignore .

before any decision is made falmouth harbour commissioners must have their oil spill contingency plan approved .
it is because of concerns over the oil spill contingency plan in lyme bay off the devon dorset border that ship to ship oil transfers were stopped there 18 months ago , prompting companies to look else where .
falmouth have made amendments to theirs in preparation .
they say the increased preparedness and apparatus that would be provided under the amended plan , would be beneficial in dealing with any future unforeseen emergencies that could happen with the shipping they receive anyway , which surely would be a good thing , not good enough though for cornwall county council .
but the council is just one of five statutory consultees , it will be the maritime and coastguard agency -lrb- mca -rrb- that makes the final decision .
they declined a request for an interview at this stage in the proceedings though they did issue a statement saying : " the mca has been made aware of suggested proposals by the falmouth harbour commissioners .

" the mca understand that a revised oil spill contingency plan has been sent to consultees .

port authorities in falmouth are looking at plans which could see huge oil tankers moving oil from one vessel to another .
the port authority believes falmouth could be well suited to this practice which is common place in other parts of the world .
if it gets the go ahead it would almost double the ports annual turn over , but environmental groups and local authorities say the risks of such activities in such an environmentally sensitive area are simply to high .
falmouth is known for a beautiful coastline and nearby conservation areas which are home to many rare species of wildlife .
but it is also a busy industrial port .
the docks are the towns biggest employer and the economic benefit of allowing ship to ship oil transfers is an opportunity the harbour authority says it simply can not ignore .
this is what environmentalists fear .
the rose bay shed thousands of gallons of crude oil in torbay after her hull was hit by a trawler in broad daylight .
some say we should have learned our lesson nearly 40 years ago when the torrey canyon spewed 70,000 tonnes of oil between lands end and the isles of scilly .
before any decision is made falmouth harbour commissioners must have their oil spill contingency plan approved .
it is because of concerns over the oil spill contingency plan in lyme bay off the devon dorset border that ship to ship oil transfers were stopped there 18 months ago , prompting companies to look else where .
falmouth have made amendments to theirs in preparation .
they say the increased preparedness and apparatus that would be provided under the amended plan , would be beneficial in dealing with any future unforeseen emergencies that could happen with the shipping they receive anyway , which surely would be a good thing , not good enough though for cornwall county council .
but the council is just one of five statutory consultees , it will be the maritime and coastguard agency -lrb- mca -rrb- that makes the final decision .
they declined a request for an interview at this stage in the proceedings though they did issue a statement saying : " the mca has been made aware of suggested proposals by the falmouth harbour commissioners .
" mca and department for transport officials attended a meeting with english nature and the falmouth harbour commissioners where the proposed operation was discussed in broad terms .
" the mca understand that a revised oil spill contingency plan has been sent to consultees .
" the mca has not had sight of this plan . "
this story of economics verses the environment is far from over .
the question is whether falmouth can allow one to prosper while protecting the other .
