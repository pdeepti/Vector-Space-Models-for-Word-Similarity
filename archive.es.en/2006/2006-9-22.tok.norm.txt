but not everyone is convinced yet about gottfried böhm 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday . a pagoda , a lotus flower , a crumpled hat have been used to describe potsdam 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday .
the latest creation by architect gottfried böhm will be the scene of a gala weekend with five premieres over three days and a visit from german president horst köhler . theater director uwe eric laufenberg 's slogan is " people belong in the middle . "
the 2006-2007 program is n't just a bunch of short-lived trendy plays , he said , nor is it all conventional one either . potsdam , located just a hop and a skip outside of berlin , is due for a fresh theater .
the city , brandenburg 's state capital , has n't had a new one in 211 years and theater productions had to make do with temporary solutions for the past 60 years . years of provisional stages since its original theater am kanal was bombed in 1945 during world war ii , the theater company has performed in provisional buildings , including a dance hall , an unfinished structure commissioned by the east german government .
since 1992 , potsdam actors have appeared on the stage of a building affectionately called the " tin can .

he did n't have total freedom in the design , though : there was a land-marked gas holder on the site that he was obliged to integrate into the building . the theater , which laufenberg called " a new icon , " is n't quite complete .
the choice of building materials , mainly glass and steel , apparently do not provide for a suitable acoustic . experts are racing to reduce the reverberation in the hall to 1.4 seconds by friday 's gala premiere . but with a magnificent view of the lake and babelsberg castle behind it , the experience inside the theater wo n't be only about what comes from the stage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the curtain opens on the 2006-2007 opera and theater season while a majority of the summer 's cultural events took place on open-air stages , as of september actors and singers are heading indoors to open the 2006-2007 opera and theater season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2006 possible presidential pardon reawakens memories of terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak of the raf terror campaign in the 1970s was marked by a spate of killings the german president may grant clemency to a controversial prisoner - a former top terrorist of the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- that unleashed a wave of terror in the 1970s and 80s . bomb attacks , kidnappings , shootings , hijackings , radical ideology and assassinations - the words are almost commonplace in today 's world plagued by global islamist terrorism .
but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .
nobody talks about this anymore , particularly after sept .
11 .
the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .
" it would be much more productive for the society to close this matter once and for all .

" the different cultures have more in common than political agitators would like us to believe , " steinmeier said on friday in new york .
" we have to do everything possible to avoid a new partitioning of the world into blocs that look hostilely at each other . " violence in the middle east and afghanistan as well as the international fight against terrorism should not be seen as a conflict of cultures or religions but as problems that need to be solved through dialog since " despite all our difference , we live in one world , " he added . the german minister also recalled the division of the world and his own country during the cold war , saying no other country had experienced being so deeply split as germany . history formed german foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of germany plays a major role in today 's politics , steinmeier said " walls and barbed wire straight through our country symbolized the division of europe and the world into two blocs until 1989 , " he said .
" since then germany has become a symbol of overcoming this division . " germany was politically influenced by the international partners who helped secure peace for 45 years , and that their influence was one of the reasons why germany is now taking on similar responsibilities in europe and other parts of the world , steinmeier said .

" give a clear sign of trust so that we can look forward together and can sit down at the negotiating table , " steinmeier said , calling the nuclear conflict with iran " urgent . " " no one wants to deny iran the right to use nuclear energy peacefully , nor is the objective of the diplomatic efforts to isolate iran , " he added . quartet should resume mideast peace efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy set sail for the middle east on thursday as expected , steinmeier also pushed the middle east quartet of the usa , the eu , russia and the united nations to restart its efforts for peace in the middle east while calling on nations there to put their animosities to rest . " whoever wants to make a life of peace instead of violence , safety instead of fear , prosperity instead of poverty possible for their children and grandchildren needs to have the courage to find new paths instead of maintaining old hostilities , " he added . after delivering one of the most anticipated speeches of the un 's meeting , steinmeier , who met with a number of world leaders during his four-day stay in new york , was scheduled to meet with other eu foreign ministers as well as us secretary of state condoleezza rice before returning to berlin on saturday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lawmakers give the go-ahead for lebanon mission germany 's parliament agreed wednesday to contribute naval and air force troops to a un force for lebanon in the first military deployment by germany in the middle east since world war ii .

" nothing upsets people who want to obscure things in this branch more than revealing their names , " seehofer told the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament . the new consumer protection law forces food controllers and authorities to publish on the internet the names and information about retailers who have sold rancid products .

" rather than creating absolute transparency , the law provides for all sorts of exceptions and back-door solutions , " he said , referring to paragraphs in the law that make it possible for authorities and food retailers to refuse to disclose information . changes likely after two-year test phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 tons of spoiled meat were found in germany green party parliamentary leader and former consumer affairs minister renate künast told german public broadcaster ard that the new law is an improvement , but should have gone further by allowing consumers to get information directly from retail stores instead of inspection authorities . the german retailers association called for sparing use of the law saying premature or unproved reports should not be allowed to make consumers uneasy . representatives from germany 's federal states have said that the new guidelines are still not optimal and are likely to be improved after a two-year test phase . germany has been under pressure to get the law passed following the rancid meat scandals of late .
until now , food controls have not been the prerogative of the federal government , but rather , the task of the germany 's 16 states . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de official : meat scandal thus far " tip of the iceberg " the spoiled meat found in the current scandal plaguing the german meat industry is just " the tip of the iceberg , " according to the the federation of german food and drink industries .

names of companies involved in recent rotten meat scandals , for instance , could be made public . german consumer minister horst seehofer said on friday that he was pleased with the new law and hoped it will deter potential offenders . he was speaking about the recent scandal involving wholesalers who had stored and sold rotten meat to stores across germany . " nothing upsets people who want to obscure things in this branch more than revealing their names , " seehofer told the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament . the new consumer protection law forces food controllers and authorities to publish on the internet the names and information about retailers who have sold rancid products .
the law also requires controllers to point to potentially dangerous food products . citizens may also now demand information from authorities themselves , or may be allowed to review authorities ' files of dubious food retailers . legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer minister horst seehöfer -lrb- l -rrb- believes exposing " bad apples " can be a deterrent critics of the new consumer protection law , however , said it does not go far enough and contains many loopholes . they point out that authorities could refuse to disclose information if retailers claimed protection under laws protecting trade and company secrets . thilo bode , head of the consumer protection agency foodwatch , said the new law hinders transparency . " rather than creating absolute transparency , the law provides for all sorts of exceptions and back-door solutions , " he said , referring to paragraphs in the law that make it possible for authorities and food retailers to refuse to disclose information . changes likely after two-year test phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 tons of spoiled meat were found in germany green party parliamentary leader and former consumer affairs minister renate künast told german public broadcaster ard that the new law is an improvement , but should have gone further by allowing consumers to get information directly from retail stores instead of inspection authorities . the german retailers association called for sparing use of the law saying premature or unproved reports should not be allowed to make consumers uneasy . representatives from germany 's federal states have said that the new guidelines are still not optimal and are likely to be improved after a two-year test phase . germany has been under pressure to get the law passed following the rancid meat scandals of late .
until now , food controls have not been the prerogative of the federal government , but rather , the task of the germany 's 16 states . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de official : meat scandal thus far " tip of the iceberg " the spoiled meat found in the current scandal plaguing the german meat industry is just " the tip of the iceberg , " according to the the federation of german food and drink industries .

" there is a hard core group of countries that are blocking , " said an eu diplomat , on condition of anonymity , after informal talks between the bloc 's justice and interior ministers in the southern finish city of tampere . the issue of national vetoes on cross-border police cooperation in criminal affairs has festered into a major obstacle to the european union 's security ambitions . while only around four of the 25 eu countries were against a move from unanimity decision-making to qualified majority voting to decide such matters , only three member states appeared to be fully in favor , diplomatic sources said . those states that diplomats most often named as being against the move included germany , the czech republic , ireland and malta , while france , luxembourg and spain were cited as most ready to take the leap . some countries fear that a change to majority voting would surrender control over or water down national security legislation .

" i 'm convinced that europe has not come far enough yet for us to arrive at any sort of majority decision now , " he said . germany argues that adopting such a system would undermine attempts to revive the constitution , which berlin has a mandate to take forward during its eu presidency , which starts in january . despite the fingers pointed in her direction , german justice minister brigitte zypries said : " no one can say that germany is blocking , " as 14 of the countries whose ministers spoke expressed doubts about abandoning unanimity . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said wednesday it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

names of companies involved in recent rotten meat scandals , for instance , could be made public . german consumer minister horst seehofer said on friday that he was pleased with the new law and hoped it will deter potential offenders . he was speaking about the recent scandal involving wholesalers who had stored and sold rotten meat to stores across germany .

she said the scheme could create 1.5 million new jobs . " when i said 1.5 million , that is not an exaggerated but an understated number , " schavan told parliamentarians thursday , adding that the number could be as high as 1.8 million , but that she was " being modest and saying 1.5 million . " the jobs would be the product of 14.6 billion euros the german government plans to invest in 17 " fields of innovation " by 2010 , schavan said .

" nothing upsets people who want to obscure things in this branch more than revealing their names , " seehofer told the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament . the new consumer protection law forces food controllers and authorities to publish on the internet the names and information about retailers who have sold rancid products .

as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .
" different yardstick for managers " leading german politicians expressed outrage over the move .
social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group head peter struck said on wednesday it showed a lack of instinct , particularly at a time when many people are trying to ensure their survival by fighting for a minimum wage .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierer says his executives should earn more saarland premier peter müller , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said it was incomprehensible why companies continued to expect sacrifices from employees while adding to managers pay packages to such an extent . " employees can only interpret -lrb- the pay increase -rrb- in the sense that executives are measured using a different yardstick , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber , the head of the cdu 's sister party .
bavarian ig metall trade union boss , werner neugebauer said siemens could expect tough negotiations over cuts to the company 's it branch sbs as well as fujitsu siemens computers .
he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .
28 million euros , 12 men , one year criticism also came from the stock markets due to siemens ' weak developments there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , the best paid ceo of a germany company , is on siemens ' supervisory board " what is the shareholder supposed to think ?
at the end of the 2002/03 business year , the siemens share was listed at around 60 euros and since then has climbed by 12.3 percent , " market analyst heino ruland of brokerage steubing told reuters monday .
but over the same period , the dax went up by 82.3 percent . a siemens spokesman on wednesday said that it was normal practice to raise executives ' pay packages at regular intervals .
the company 's 12 executives were remunerated with around 28 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in cash and securities over the previous business year .

but not everyone is convinced yet about gottfried böhm 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday . a pagoda , a lotus flower , a crumpled hat have been used to describe potsdam 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday .
the latest creation by architect gottfried böhm will be the scene of a gala weekend with five premieres over three days and a visit from german president horst köhler . theater director uwe eric laufenberg 's slogan is " people belong in the middle . "
the 2006-2007 program is n't just a bunch of short-lived trendy plays , he said , nor is it all conventional one either . potsdam , located just a hop and a skip outside of berlin , is due for a fresh theater .
the city , brandenburg 's state capital , has n't had a new one in 211 years and theater productions had to make do with temporary solutions for the past 60 years . years of provisional stages since its original theater am kanal was bombed in 1945 during world war ii , the theater company has performed in provisional buildings , including a dance hall , an unfinished structure commissioned by the east german government .
since 1992 , potsdam actors have appeared on the stage of a building affectionately called the " tin can . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt allegemeine zeitung called the theater " an idyll of listlessness " gottfried böhm 's 26-million-euro -lrb- $ 33 million -rrb- theater rests on the edge of a lake and can be accessed either by boat or from schiffbauergasse on the other side , a street that has become known as a cultural center . a native of cologne , böhm is the only german architect to have received the pritzker prize , which is described as the nobel prize for architecture .
the german architecture museum in frankfurt is featuring an exhibit on his works until nov .
5 . last minute adjustments böhm said the 484-seat hans otto theater was inspired by a trip he took to asia , which is apparent in the playfully layered , pagoda-like form .
he did n't have total freedom in the design , though : there was a land-marked gas holder on the site that he was obliged to integrate into the building . the theater , which laufenberg called " a new icon , " is n't quite complete .
the choice of building materials , mainly glass and steel , apparently do not provide for a suitable acoustic . experts are racing to reduce the reverberation in the hall to 1.4 seconds by friday 's gala premiere . but with a magnificent view of the lake and babelsberg castle behind it , the experience inside the theater wo n't be only about what comes from the stage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the curtain opens on the 2006-2007 opera and theater season while a majority of the summer 's cultural events took place on open-air stages , as of september actors and singers are heading indoors to open the 2006-2007 opera and theater season .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagendijk said turkey must amend article 301 " i am happy for shafak , but i believe article 301 must be amended , " joost lagendijk , a senior member of the european parliament , said after the hearing which he followed as an observer .
" if not , there will be similar cases .
only the amendment of the article will satisfy the european union . " his comments were echoed by the eu executive . " the commission welcomes this recent judgment , this is obviously good news , " the european commission 's enlargement spokeswoman krisztina nagy said in brussels .
she added , however , that " a significant threat to freedom of expression " remains in turkish law and urged amendments in article 301 and other " vague " penal code provisions .
charges focused o n fictio n al character shafak , who gave birth to her first child last week , was not present in the courtroom . her trial added a bizarre twist to article 301 because the charges stemmed not from a public statement by the defendant as in other cases , but from lines uttered by shafak 's fictional armenian characters in " the bastard of istanbul . "
one of the book 's characters speaks of " turkish butchers " and of a " genocide " while others talk about being " slaughtered like sheep " during the 1915-1917 massacres . erdogan said his government was ready to discuss proposals to amend article 301 as he welcomed shafak 's acquittal . " the ruling party and the opposition can sit down together again to discuss this issue as laws are not eternal , " he said in ankara . no one has yet been imprisoned under the article , but the appeals court in july confirmed the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting a precedent . on nov .
8 , the european commission will issue a key report on turkey 's progress towards membership , which is expected to be critical of the pace of reform .
" culture of ly n chi n g " shafak also hailed her acquittal , but expressed concern that " a culture of lynching " was emerging in turkey at a time when respect for dissenting views is crucial to boost the country 's democratic credentials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author orhan pamuk has also been brought to court under article 301 " i am concerned about an idea that has recently developed in turkey , the idea that ' those who do not think like us are cooperating with the enemy , " ' she told ntv television . she was referring to a group of nationalist lawyers who instigated the charges against her , the latest in its relentless campaign to pursue before the courts intellectuals who dispute the official line on the armenian massacres . members of the group , which many say is aiming to undermine turkey 's eu bid , engaged in short-lived scuffles with supporters of shafak outside the courtroom .
police immediately stepped in and detained two people , ntv said . shafak 's novel takes place in istanbul and san francisco and recounts the stories of four generations of turkish women and an american-armenian family , the descendants of survivors of the massacres . armenians assert that up to 1.5 million of their people were slaughtered in what was genocide between 1915 and 1917 , as the ottoman empire , modern turkey 's predecessor , was falling apart . categorically rejecting the genocide label , turkey argues that 300,000 armenians and at least as many turks died in civil strife when armenians took up arms for independence in eastern anatolia and sided with invading russian troops . much to ankara 's ire , the massacres have been recognized as genocide by many countries .
last year , germany 's parliament condemned the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians by turks in 1915-1916 , though it avoided using the term " genocide . " a taboo for decades , the armenian killings have only recently become the subject of a tentative public debate , often sending nationalists into a frenzy . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey .

while his predecessors roman herzog und johannes rau gave these annual keynote talks at the upmarket hotel adlon , köhler 's choice of venue reflected his first priority - addressing one of germany 's most urgent problems , the state of its education system . " adequate education is a prerequisite of democracy as well as a highly effective form of social insurance , " he said . you n g people fearful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are well aware how much education matters meanwhile , just a few kilometers away , germany 's family affairs minister ursula von der leyen and sociologist klaus hurrelmann were unveiling the 15th shell study on german youth .
published every three to four years , it is considered the definitive survey of its kind - and the news this year lent weight to the president 's call for an educational revamp . researchers from bielefeld university and the infratest social research institute questioned over 2,500 young people between 12-25 , two thirds of whom admitted they were unnerved by the struggling economy and spiraling poverty . four years ago , only 45 percent said they were apprehensive about their future - 8 percent less than in 2006 .
so what 's gone wrong ? the majority of those questioned said they saw education and qualifications as key to later success - but as köhler pointed out in his opening sentence , some 80,000 young people leave school in germany without a qualification . only 38 percent of pupils from the lowest level of high schools in germany 's three-tier educational system were optimistic about the future , while 57 percent of students at the academically more demanding " gymnasium " said they expected to fare well in life . girls take to the fast la n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are harder working than boys almost as striking as the discrepancy in outlook between students from the three different school types was the gender divide , with 7 percent more girls making the grade to " gymnasium " than boys and 55 percent of them aiming to leave school with a diploma compared to just 47 percent of their male peers . but both girls and boys showed a marked reluctance to start families , despite the fact that 72 percent agreed that family was important , and 39 percent thought marriage was " great . " " most of them are well aware that today it 's harder than ever to juggle education , a job , a career , a relationship and children , " said von der leyen . political a n d eco n omic fall-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disaffected young people are easily swayed by right-wing sloganeering her comments were reflected in further statistics contained in the study , which demonstrated a rise in psychological problems among both young people and their parents .
hurrelmann attributed this primarily to germany 's economic troubles . " financially weak parents can have problems raising children , " he said .
" but all of us - including economists - have to realize that badly brought up children are an economic disadvantage to the country . " equally , he added , they can be a political disadvantage .
far-right parties such as the npd are notoriously quick to take advantage of disaffected young peoples ' anger at society and win them over to its cause . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education failures linked to social background the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 22.09.2006 long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new hans otto theater reminds some of the sydney opera house the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .
but not everyone is convinced yet about gottfried böhm 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday . a pagoda , a lotus flower , a crumpled hat have been used to describe potsdam 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday .
the latest creation by architect gottfried böhm will be the scene of a gala weekend with five premieres over three days and a visit from german president horst köhler . theater director uwe eric laufenberg 's slogan is " people belong in the middle . "
the 2006-2007 program is n't just a bunch of short-lived trendy plays , he said , nor is it all conventional one either . potsdam , located just a hop and a skip outside of berlin , is due for a fresh theater .
the city , brandenburg 's state capital , has n't had a new one in 211 years and theater productions had to make do with temporary solutions for the past 60 years . years of provisional stages since its original theater am kanal was bombed in 1945 during world war ii , the theater company has performed in provisional buildings , including a dance hall , an unfinished structure commissioned by the east german government .
since 1992 , potsdam actors have appeared on the stage of a building affectionately called the " tin can . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt allegemeine zeitung called the theater " an idyll of listlessness " gottfried böhm 's 26-million-euro -lrb- $ 33 million -rrb- theater rests on the edge of a lake and can be accessed either by boat or from schiffbauergasse on the other side , a street that has become known as a cultural center . a native of cologne , böhm is the only german architect to have received the pritzker prize , which is described as the nobel prize for architecture .
the german architecture museum in frankfurt is featuring an exhibit on his works until nov .
5 . last minute adjustments böhm said the 484-seat hans otto theater was inspired by a trip he took to asia , which is apparent in the playfully layered , pagoda-like form .
he did n't have total freedom in the design , though : there was a land-marked gas holder on the site that he was obliged to integrate into the building . the theater , which laufenberg called " a new icon , " is n't quite complete .
the choice of building materials , mainly glass and steel , apparently do not provide for a suitable acoustic . experts are racing to reduce the reverberation in the hall to 1.4 seconds by friday 's gala premiere . but with a magnificent view of the lake and babelsberg castle behind it , the experience inside the theater wo n't be only about what comes from the stage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the curtain opens on the 2006-2007 opera and theater season while a majority of the summer 's cultural events took place on open-air stages , as of september actors and singers are heading indoors to open the 2006-2007 opera and theater season .

ten people survived with serious injuries . " there 's little hope of finding anyone alive in the wreckage , " said a police spokesman seven hours after the collision on an elevated test track in emsland , northern germany . in addition to merkel , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee interrupted a trip in china to return to germany .
the chancellor and german president horst köhler sent their condolences to the families of the victims and thanked those who took part in the rescue operations . transrapid crashed into maintenance train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane lifts parts of the destroyed train on friday the magnetic levitation train was reported to be traveling at some 170 kilometers -lrb- 106 miles -rrb- per hour when it hit a maintenance train . what led to the accident remains unclear , but a spokesman for the operators of the track said initial investigations appeared to rule out a technical fault , indicating that human error was to blame . the maintenance train was tasked with the daily cleaning of the transrapid 's track and was supposed to be removed from the track before the transrapid starts on the 31.5-kilometer-long test track , which is four meters above the ground between dörpen and lathen close to the dutch border . " this accident would not have been possible if all regulations were adhered to , " said rudolf schwarz , head of operators iabg , who additionally pledged to clarify the circumstances surrounding the accident " as soon as possible .

" there is a hard core group of countries that are blocking , " said an eu diplomat , on condition of anonymity , after informal talks between the bloc 's justice and interior ministers in the southern finish city of tampere . the issue of national vetoes on cross-border police cooperation in criminal affairs has festered into a major obstacle to the european union 's security ambitions . while only around four of the 25 eu countries were against a move from unanimity decision-making to qualified majority voting to decide such matters , only three member states appeared to be fully in favor , diplomatic sources said . those states that diplomats most often named as being against the move included germany , the czech republic , ireland and malta , while france , luxembourg and spain were cited as most ready to take the leap . some countries fear that a change to majority voting would surrender control over or water down national security legislation .
others are concerned that it may conflict with their constitutions .
urgent need for change yet many countries agree there is urgent need for change , given the terror attacks in london and madrid and three foiled plots in europe this year , to ensure that draft legislation does not gather dust as it awaits unanimous endorsement . three years elapsed before a compromise was reached on a warrant easing the exchange of evidence between eu countries .
other projects have remained on hold for almost as long , including accords on common minimum rights for suspects , cross-border investigations and protecting information used for security purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid was hit by a terrorist attack in march 2004 " the fact that practical results are insufficient undermines the eu 's credibility at eu level both among citizens and civil servants , " said finnish interior minister kari rajamaki , co-hosting the talks as eu president . " what citizens expect of the eu is added value in security matters , especially in combating organized crime and terrorism , " he said . at a press conference after the talks , he and eu justice commissioner franco frattini refused to name the countries that were blocking , with rajamaki saying only that the results of the talks would now be analyzed . germany prefers reviving eu constitution many issues would have been resolved by the planned eu constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in may last year and fell into limbo as countries gave up ratifying it . in an effort to keep up with fast-evolving security needs , the european commission - the eu 's executive body - has urged members to use an article from a past treaty to move to so-called qualified majority voting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said germany 's not blocking unfortunately for those in favor of change , shifting to qualified majority voting - a system in which 62 percent of europe 's population must be represented - itself requires a unanimous decision . " the question is whether we can accept to take decisions that may be against our own interests , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , representing germany 's states at the talks , before friday 's meeting . " i 'm convinced that europe has not come far enough yet for us to arrive at any sort of majority decision now , " he said . germany argues that adopting such a system would undermine attempts to revive the constitution , which berlin has a mandate to take forward during its eu presidency , which starts in january . despite the fingers pointed in her direction , german justice minister brigitte zypries said : " no one can say that germany is blocking , " as 14 of the countries whose ministers spoke expressed doubts about abandoning unanimity . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said wednesday it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .

" employees can only interpret -lrb- the pay increase -rrb- in the sense that executives are measured using a different yardstick , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber , the head of the cdu 's sister party .
bavarian ig metall trade union boss , werner neugebauer said siemens could expect tough negotiations over cuts to the company 's it branch sbs as well as fujitsu siemens computers .
he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .
28 million euros , 12 men , one year criticism also came from the stock markets due to siemens ' weak developments there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , the best paid ceo of a germany company , is on siemens ' supervisory board " what is the shareholder supposed to think ?
at the end of the 2002/03 business year , the siemens share was listed at around 60 euros and since then has climbed by 12.3 percent , " market analyst heino ruland of brokerage steubing told reuters monday .
but over the same period , the dax went up by 82.3 percent . a siemens spokesman on wednesday said that it was normal practice to raise executives ' pay packages at regular intervals .

while his predecessors roman herzog und johannes rau gave these annual keynote talks at the upmarket hotel adlon , köhler 's choice of venue reflected his first priority - addressing one of germany 's most urgent problems , the state of its education system .

published every three to four years , it is considered the definitive survey of its kind - and the news this year lent weight to the president 's call for an educational revamp . researchers from bielefeld university and the infratest social research institute questioned over 2,500 young people between 12-25 , two thirds of whom admitted they were unnerved by the struggling economy and spiraling poverty . four years ago , only 45 percent said they were apprehensive about their future - 8 percent less than in 2006 .

hurrelmann attributed this primarily to germany 's economic troubles . " financially weak parents can have problems raising children , " he said .
" but all of us - including economists - have to realize that badly brought up children are an economic disadvantage to the country . " equally , he added , they can be a political disadvantage .

she said the scheme could create 1.5 million new jobs . " when i said 1.5 million , that is not an exaggerated but an understated number , " schavan told parliamentarians thursday , adding that the number could be as high as 1.8 million , but that she was " being modest and saying 1.5 million . " the jobs would be the product of 14.6 billion euros the german government plans to invest in 17 " fields of innovation " by 2010 , schavan said .
about 90,000 of the new positions would be in the high-tech industries themselves with the others coming from businesses that support them , she added . most of the federal money is slated to go into the aerospace and energy sectors , although substantial amounts will also be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as bio and nano technologies . germany 's mp3 problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideas developed in germany are often marketed elsewhere the new funding plan focuses its attention on partnerships between research institutes and companies to help scientists receive feedback on the implementation possibilities of their work and to get their ideas into the market faster - an issue that has posed a problem for german researchers in the past .
the mp3 file format commonly used to save and play digital music , for example , was developed in germany but marketed by businesses outside of the country . although germany is ranked second in registered patents behind the united states , researchers say the path to the market needs to be streamlined and improved . " it is no longer among the german strengths to make market-ready innovations and sophisticated services from excellent ideas , " arend oetker , president of the association of foundations for german science , said in a statement tuesday . extra funding for working together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan said she wants new ideas to " ignite " in germany as part of the high-tech research funding plan , schavan 's ministry teamed up with the association to sponsor a contest that will award 250,000 euros to five universities for projects conducted in cooperation with companies .
the organizers issued a call for ideas on tuesday . the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association also welcomed the ministry 's decision to give priority to measures that cut the time it takes for research to hit the shelves . " we have to not only fill the research pipeline but also advocate for a quick implementation of technological opportunities in germany , " said edward krubasik , the group 's president .
" that is the only way we will create new sustainable domestic jobs . " a researcher friendly environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan wants more researchers to be working in germany the strategy also calls for germany to increase its public and private research spending from the current 2.5 percent to 3 percent of its gross domestic product over the next four years , a goal all european union members had previously said they would try to meet . " we are putting the switches in place to make germany a stronger growth motor for research in europe , " schavan said , adding that she wanted the country to become " one of the most researcher friendly countries in the world . " the growth is expected to come from aeronautics , pharmaceuticals , medical technology , logistics , and measurement and control technology , according to a 2006 report by the economic research company prognos , which said those industries are likely to grow in germany . doubts about new jobs remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies clustered in one area often share logistical benefits in the report , which drew attention to the concentration of germany 's high-tech companies in certain areas , prognos came to the conclusion that mainly the south of the country and a handful of northern cities have been benefiting from clusters of activity in their vicinities . the clusters , which often include a university or other research institute , work to combine knowledge in different fields to develop new products and gain an edge over international competitors . by 2030 , many of the products bearing the " made in germany " stamp will come from the high-tech industry as mass production continues leaving much of western europe for countries to the east that have lower labor costs , according to the report . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pours more money into high-tech berlin has announced it is investing 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.7 billion -rrb- in high-tech over the next three years .

" nothing upsets people who want to obscure things in this branch more than revealing their names , " seehofer told the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament . the new consumer protection law forces food controllers and authorities to publish on the internet the names and information about retailers who have sold rancid products .
the law also requires controllers to point to potentially dangerous food products . citizens may also now demand information from authorities themselves , or may be allowed to review authorities ' files of dubious food retailers . legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer minister horst seehöfer -lrb- l -rrb- believes exposing " bad apples " can be a deterrent critics of the new consumer protection law , however , said it does not go far enough and contains many loopholes . they point out that authorities could refuse to disclose information if retailers claimed protection under laws protecting trade and company secrets . thilo bode , head of the consumer protection agency foodwatch , said the new law hinders transparency . " rather than creating absolute transparency , the law provides for all sorts of exceptions and back-door solutions , " he said , referring to paragraphs in the law that make it possible for authorities and food retailers to refuse to disclose information . changes likely after two-year test phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 tons of spoiled meat were found in germany green party parliamentary leader and former consumer affairs minister renate künast told german public broadcaster ard that the new law is an improvement , but should have gone further by allowing consumers to get information directly from retail stores instead of inspection authorities . the german retailers association called for sparing use of the law saying premature or unproved reports should not be allowed to make consumers uneasy . representatives from germany 's federal states have said that the new guidelines are still not optimal and are likely to be improved after a two-year test phase . germany has been under pressure to get the law passed following the rancid meat scandals of late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.09.2006 siemens outrages politicians with executive pay hikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hours are long , but the perks are many for managers siemens ' plan to raise executives ' pay has led to indignation among german politicians and analysts as the company prepares to begin collective negotiations with trade unions . the uproar over siemens decision to increase top managers pay by 30 percent has yet to die down .
as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .
" different yardstick for managers " leading german politicians expressed outrage over the move .
social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group head peter struck said on wednesday it showed a lack of instinct , particularly at a time when many people are trying to ensure their survival by fighting for a minimum wage .
spd secretary general hubertus heil said the executives filled their own pockets with no regard for employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierer says his executives should earn more saarland premier peter müller , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said it was incomprehensible why companies continued to expect sacrifices from employees while adding to managers pay packages to such an extent . " employees can only interpret -lrb- the pay increase -rrb- in the sense that executives are measured using a different yardstick , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber , the head of the cdu 's sister party .
bavarian ig metall trade union boss , werner neugebauer said siemens could expect tough negotiations over cuts to the company 's it branch sbs as well as fujitsu siemens computers .
he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2006 possible presidential pardon reawakens memories of terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak of the raf terror campaign in the 1970s was marked by a spate of killings the german president may grant clemency to a controversial prisoner - a former top terrorist of the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- that unleashed a wave of terror in the 1970s and 80s . bomb attacks , kidnappings , shootings , hijackings , radical ideology and assassinations - the words are almost commonplace in today 's world plagued by global islamist terrorism .
but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .
nobody talks about this anymore , particularly after sept .
11 .
the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .
" it would be much more productive for the society to close this matter once and for all .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history .

the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past .

while his predecessors roman herzog und johannes rau gave these annual keynote talks at the upmarket hotel adlon , köhler 's choice of venue reflected his first priority - addressing one of germany 's most urgent problems , the state of its education system . " adequate education is a prerequisite of democracy as well as a highly effective form of social insurance , " he said . you n g people fearful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are well aware how much education matters meanwhile , just a few kilometers away , germany 's family affairs minister ursula von der leyen and sociologist klaus hurrelmann were unveiling the 15th shell study on german youth .
published every three to four years , it is considered the definitive survey of its kind - and the news this year lent weight to the president 's call for an educational revamp . researchers from bielefeld university and the infratest social research institute questioned over 2,500 young people between 12-25 , two thirds of whom admitted they were unnerved by the struggling economy and spiraling poverty . four years ago , only 45 percent said they were apprehensive about their future - 8 percent less than in 2006 .
so what 's gone wrong ? the majority of those questioned said they saw education and qualifications as key to later success - but as köhler pointed out in his opening sentence , some 80,000 young people leave school in germany without a qualification . only 38 percent of pupils from the lowest level of high schools in germany 's three-tier educational system were optimistic about the future , while 57 percent of students at the academically more demanding " gymnasium " said they expected to fare well in life . girls take to the fast la n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are harder working than boys almost as striking as the discrepancy in outlook between students from the three different school types was the gender divide , with 7 percent more girls making the grade to " gymnasium " than boys and 55 percent of them aiming to leave school with a diploma compared to just 47 percent of their male peers . but both girls and boys showed a marked reluctance to start families , despite the fact that 72 percent agreed that family was important , and 39 percent thought marriage was " great . " " most of them are well aware that today it 's harder than ever to juggle education , a job , a career , a relationship and children , " said von der leyen . political a n d eco n omic fall-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disaffected young people are easily swayed by right-wing sloganeering her comments were reflected in further statistics contained in the study , which demonstrated a rise in psychological problems among both young people and their parents .
hurrelmann attributed this primarily to germany 's economic troubles . " financially weak parents can have problems raising children , " he said .
" but all of us - including economists - have to realize that badly brought up children are an economic disadvantage to the country . " equally , he added , they can be a political disadvantage .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .

names of companies involved in recent rotten meat scandals , for instance , could be made public . german consumer minister horst seehofer said on friday that he was pleased with the new law and hoped it will deter potential offenders . he was speaking about the recent scandal involving wholesalers who had stored and sold rotten meat to stores across germany . " nothing upsets people who want to obscure things in this branch more than revealing their names , " seehofer told the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament . the new consumer protection law forces food controllers and authorities to publish on the internet the names and information about retailers who have sold rancid products .
the law also requires controllers to point to potentially dangerous food products . citizens may also now demand information from authorities themselves , or may be allowed to review authorities ' files of dubious food retailers . legal loopholes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer minister horst seehöfer -lrb- l -rrb- believes exposing " bad apples " can be a deterrent critics of the new consumer protection law , however , said it does not go far enough and contains many loopholes . they point out that authorities could refuse to disclose information if retailers claimed protection under laws protecting trade and company secrets . thilo bode , head of the consumer protection agency foodwatch , said the new law hinders transparency . " rather than creating absolute transparency , the law provides for all sorts of exceptions and back-door solutions , " he said , referring to paragraphs in the law that make it possible for authorities and food retailers to refuse to disclose information . changes likely after two-year test phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 tons of spoiled meat were found in germany green party parliamentary leader and former consumer affairs minister renate künast told german public broadcaster ard that the new law is an improvement , but should have gone further by allowing consumers to get information directly from retail stores instead of inspection authorities . the german retailers association called for sparing use of the law saying premature or unproved reports should not be allowed to make consumers uneasy . representatives from germany 's federal states have said that the new guidelines are still not optimal and are likely to be improved after a two-year test phase . germany has been under pressure to get the law passed following the rancid meat scandals of late .

she said the scheme could create 1.5 million new jobs . " when i said 1.5 million , that is not an exaggerated but an understated number , " schavan told parliamentarians thursday , adding that the number could be as high as 1.8 million , but that she was " being modest and saying 1.5 million . " the jobs would be the product of 14.6 billion euros the german government plans to invest in 17 " fields of innovation " by 2010 , schavan said .
about 90,000 of the new positions would be in the high-tech industries themselves with the others coming from businesses that support them , she added . most of the federal money is slated to go into the aerospace and energy sectors , although substantial amounts will also be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as bio and nano technologies . germany 's mp3 problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideas developed in germany are often marketed elsewhere the new funding plan focuses its attention on partnerships between research institutes and companies to help scientists receive feedback on the implementation possibilities of their work and to get their ideas into the market faster - an issue that has posed a problem for german researchers in the past .
the mp3 file format commonly used to save and play digital music , for example , was developed in germany but marketed by businesses outside of the country . although germany is ranked second in registered patents behind the united states , researchers say the path to the market needs to be streamlined and improved . " it is no longer among the german strengths to make market-ready innovations and sophisticated services from excellent ideas , " arend oetker , president of the association of foundations for german science , said in a statement tuesday . extra funding for working together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan said she wants new ideas to " ignite " in germany as part of the high-tech research funding plan , schavan 's ministry teamed up with the association to sponsor a contest that will award 250,000 euros to five universities for projects conducted in cooperation with companies .
the organizers issued a call for ideas on tuesday . the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association also welcomed the ministry 's decision to give priority to measures that cut the time it takes for research to hit the shelves . " we have to not only fill the research pipeline but also advocate for a quick implementation of technological opportunities in germany , " said edward krubasik , the group 's president .
" that is the only way we will create new sustainable domestic jobs . " a researcher friendly environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan wants more researchers to be working in germany the strategy also calls for germany to increase its public and private research spending from the current 2.5 percent to 3 percent of its gross domestic product over the next four years , a goal all european union members had previously said they would try to meet . " we are putting the switches in place to make germany a stronger growth motor for research in europe , " schavan said , adding that she wanted the country to become " one of the most researcher friendly countries in the world . " the growth is expected to come from aeronautics , pharmaceuticals , medical technology , logistics , and measurement and control technology , according to a 2006 report by the economic research company prognos , which said those industries are likely to grow in germany . doubts about new jobs remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies clustered in one area often share logistical benefits in the report , which drew attention to the concentration of germany 's high-tech companies in certain areas , prognos came to the conclusion that mainly the south of the country and a handful of northern cities have been benefiting from clusters of activity in their vicinities . the clusters , which often include a university or other research institute , work to combine knowledge in different fields to develop new products and gain an edge over international competitors . by 2030 , many of the products bearing the " made in germany " stamp will come from the high-tech industry as mass production continues leaving much of western europe for countries to the east that have lower labor costs , according to the report . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pours more money into high-tech berlin has announced it is investing 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.7 billion -rrb- in high-tech over the next three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 22.09.2006 long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new hans otto theater reminds some of the sydney opera house the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .
but not everyone is convinced yet about gottfried böhm 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday . a pagoda , a lotus flower , a crumpled hat have been used to describe potsdam 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday .
the latest creation by architect gottfried böhm will be the scene of a gala weekend with five premieres over three days and a visit from german president horst köhler . theater director uwe eric laufenberg 's slogan is " people belong in the middle . "
the 2006-2007 program is n't just a bunch of short-lived trendy plays , he said , nor is it all conventional one either . potsdam , located just a hop and a skip outside of berlin , is due for a fresh theater .
the city , brandenburg 's state capital , has n't had a new one in 211 years and theater productions had to make do with temporary solutions for the past 60 years . years of provisional stages since its original theater am kanal was bombed in 1945 during world war ii , the theater company has performed in provisional buildings , including a dance hall , an unfinished structure commissioned by the east german government .
since 1992 , potsdam actors have appeared on the stage of a building affectionately called the " tin can . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt allegemeine zeitung called the theater " an idyll of listlessness " gottfried böhm 's 26-million-euro -lrb- $ 33 million -rrb- theater rests on the edge of a lake and can be accessed either by boat or from schiffbauergasse on the other side , a street that has become known as a cultural center . a native of cologne , böhm is the only german architect to have received the pritzker prize , which is described as the nobel prize for architecture .
the german architecture museum in frankfurt is featuring an exhibit on his works until nov .
5 . last minute adjustments böhm said the 484-seat hans otto theater was inspired by a trip he took to asia , which is apparent in the playfully layered , pagoda-like form .
he did n't have total freedom in the design , though : there was a land-marked gas holder on the site that he was obliged to integrate into the building . the theater , which laufenberg called " a new icon , " is n't quite complete .
the choice of building materials , mainly glass and steel , apparently do not provide for a suitable acoustic . experts are racing to reduce the reverberation in the hall to 1.4 seconds by friday 's gala premiere . but with a magnificent view of the lake and babelsberg castle behind it , the experience inside the theater wo n't be only about what comes from the stage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the curtain opens on the 2006-2007 opera and theater season while a majority of the summer 's cultural events took place on open-air stages , as of september actors and singers are heading indoors to open the 2006-2007 opera and theater season .

but not everyone is convinced yet about gottfried böhm 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday . a pagoda , a lotus flower , a crumpled hat have been used to describe potsdam 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday .
the latest creation by architect gottfried böhm will be the scene of a gala weekend with five premieres over three days and a visit from german president horst köhler . theater director uwe eric laufenberg 's slogan is " people belong in the middle . "
the 2006-2007 program is n't just a bunch of short-lived trendy plays , he said , nor is it all conventional one either . potsdam , located just a hop and a skip outside of berlin , is due for a fresh theater .
the city , brandenburg 's state capital , has n't had a new one in 211 years and theater productions had to make do with temporary solutions for the past 60 years . years of provisional stages since its original theater am kanal was bombed in 1945 during world war ii , the theater company has performed in provisional buildings , including a dance hall , an unfinished structure commissioned by the east german government .
since 1992 , potsdam actors have appeared on the stage of a building affectionately called the " tin can . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt allegemeine zeitung called the theater " an idyll of listlessness " gottfried böhm 's 26-million-euro -lrb- $ 33 million -rrb- theater rests on the edge of a lake and can be accessed either by boat or from schiffbauergasse on the other side , a street that has become known as a cultural center . a native of cologne , böhm is the only german architect to have received the pritzker prize , which is described as the nobel prize for architecture .
the german architecture museum in frankfurt is featuring an exhibit on his works until nov .
5 . last minute adjustments böhm said the 484-seat hans otto theater was inspired by a trip he took to asia , which is apparent in the playfully layered , pagoda-like form .
he did n't have total freedom in the design , though : there was a land-marked gas holder on the site that he was obliged to integrate into the building . the theater , which laufenberg called " a new icon , " is n't quite complete .
the choice of building materials , mainly glass and steel , apparently do not provide for a suitable acoustic . experts are racing to reduce the reverberation in the hall to 1.4 seconds by friday 's gala premiere . but with a magnificent view of the lake and babelsberg castle behind it , the experience inside the theater wo n't be only about what comes from the stage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the curtain opens on the 2006-2007 opera and theater season while a majority of the summer 's cultural events took place on open-air stages , as of september actors and singers are heading indoors to open the 2006-2007 opera and theater season .

as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .
" different yardstick for managers " leading german politicians expressed outrage over the move .
social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group head peter struck said on wednesday it showed a lack of instinct , particularly at a time when many people are trying to ensure their survival by fighting for a minimum wage .
spd secretary general hubertus heil said the executives filled their own pockets with no regard for employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierer says his executives should earn more saarland premier peter müller , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said it was incomprehensible why companies continued to expect sacrifices from employees while adding to managers pay packages to such an extent . " employees can only interpret -lrb- the pay increase -rrb- in the sense that executives are measured using a different yardstick , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber , the head of the cdu 's sister party .
bavarian ig metall trade union boss , werner neugebauer said siemens could expect tough negotiations over cuts to the company 's it branch sbs as well as fujitsu siemens computers .
he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .
28 million euros , 12 men , one year criticism also came from the stock markets due to siemens ' weak developments there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , the best paid ceo of a germany company , is on siemens ' supervisory board " what is the shareholder supposed to think ?
at the end of the 2002/03 business year , the siemens share was listed at around 60 euros and since then has climbed by 12.3 percent , " market analyst heino ruland of brokerage steubing told reuters monday .
but over the same period , the dax went up by 82.3 percent . a siemens spokesman on wednesday said that it was normal practice to raise executives ' pay packages at regular intervals .
the company 's 12 executives were remunerated with around 28 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in cash and securities over the previous business year .
ceo klaus kleinfeld was paid nearly 3.3 million euros alone . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief ackermann stays on top germany 's biggest bank has extended chief executive josef ackermann 's contract until 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : press freedom : basic rights at stake poland cracks down on liberal media german supreme court rules magazine raid unconstitutional court acquits satirical french mag over mohammed cartoons eu " appalled " by killing of armenian-turkish journalist human rights -pipe- 22.09.2006 turkish author cleared in trial , eu keeps up pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafak did not attend the trial as she gave birth just days before a turkish court has acquitted author elif shafak in a trial over a book about the massacres of armenians during world war i , saving the government from fresh embarrassment in its ties to the european union . despite thursday 's acquittal , brussels warned turkey that it should purge its penal code of restrictions on freedom of speech to convince the bloc of its commitment to human rights and democracy norms . with only weeks to go before the eu issues its verdict on turkey 's membership progress , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said his government was open to proposals to reform infamous article 301 of the penal code that landed shafak and a string of other intellectuals in court . the judges cleared shafak , 35 , on lack of evidence shortly after the trial began in a cramped courtroom in central istanbul under tight security against violence by nationalist protestors . shafak risked up to three years in jail for " denigrating turkish national identity " in her best-selling novel " the bastard of istanbul , " or " baba ve pic " -lrb- the father and the bastard -rrb- in turkish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagendijk said turkey must amend article 301 " i am happy for shafak , but i believe article 301 must be amended , " joost lagendijk , a senior member of the european parliament , said after the hearing which he followed as an observer .
" if not , there will be similar cases .
only the amendment of the article will satisfy the european union . " his comments were echoed by the eu executive . " the commission welcomes this recent judgment , this is obviously good news , " the european commission 's enlargement spokeswoman krisztina nagy said in brussels .
she added , however , that " a significant threat to freedom of expression " remains in turkish law and urged amendments in article 301 and other " vague " penal code provisions .
charges focused o n fictio n al character shafak , who gave birth to her first child last week , was not present in the courtroom . her trial added a bizarre twist to article 301 because the charges stemmed not from a public statement by the defendant as in other cases , but from lines uttered by shafak 's fictional armenian characters in " the bastard of istanbul . "
one of the book 's characters speaks of " turkish butchers " and of a " genocide " while others talk about being " slaughtered like sheep " during the 1915-1917 massacres . erdogan said his government was ready to discuss proposals to amend article 301 as he welcomed shafak 's acquittal . " the ruling party and the opposition can sit down together again to discuss this issue as laws are not eternal , " he said in ankara . no one has yet been imprisoned under the article , but the appeals court in july confirmed the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting a precedent . on nov .
8 , the european commission will issue a key report on turkey 's progress towards membership , which is expected to be critical of the pace of reform .
" culture of ly n chi n g " shafak also hailed her acquittal , but expressed concern that " a culture of lynching " was emerging in turkey at a time when respect for dissenting views is crucial to boost the country 's democratic credentials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author orhan pamuk has also been brought to court under article 301 " i am concerned about an idea that has recently developed in turkey , the idea that ' those who do not think like us are cooperating with the enemy , " ' she told ntv television . she was referring to a group of nationalist lawyers who instigated the charges against her , the latest in its relentless campaign to pursue before the courts intellectuals who dispute the official line on the armenian massacres . members of the group , which many say is aiming to undermine turkey 's eu bid , engaged in short-lived scuffles with supporters of shafak outside the courtroom .
police immediately stepped in and detained two people , ntv said . shafak 's novel takes place in istanbul and san francisco and recounts the stories of four generations of turkish women and an american-armenian family , the descendants of survivors of the massacres . armenians assert that up to 1.5 million of their people were slaughtered in what was genocide between 1915 and 1917 , as the ottoman empire , modern turkey 's predecessor , was falling apart . categorically rejecting the genocide label , turkey argues that 300,000 armenians and at least as many turks died in civil strife when armenians took up arms for independence in eastern anatolia and sided with invading russian troops . much to ankara 's ire , the massacres have been recognized as genocide by many countries .
last year , germany 's parliament condemned the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians by turks in 1915-1916 , though it avoided using the term " genocide . " a taboo for decades , the armenian killings have only recently become the subject of a tentative public debate , often sending nationalists into a frenzy . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey .

while his predecessors roman herzog und johannes rau gave these annual keynote talks at the upmarket hotel adlon , köhler 's choice of venue reflected his first priority - addressing one of germany 's most urgent problems , the state of its education system . " adequate education is a prerequisite of democracy as well as a highly effective form of social insurance , " he said . you n g people fearful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are well aware how much education matters meanwhile , just a few kilometers away , germany 's family affairs minister ursula von der leyen and sociologist klaus hurrelmann were unveiling the 15th shell study on german youth .
published every three to four years , it is considered the definitive survey of its kind - and the news this year lent weight to the president 's call for an educational revamp . researchers from bielefeld university and the infratest social research institute questioned over 2,500 young people between 12-25 , two thirds of whom admitted they were unnerved by the struggling economy and spiraling poverty . four years ago , only 45 percent said they were apprehensive about their future - 8 percent less than in 2006 .
so what 's gone wrong ? the majority of those questioned said they saw education and qualifications as key to later success - but as köhler pointed out in his opening sentence , some 80,000 young people leave school in germany without a qualification . only 38 percent of pupils from the lowest level of high schools in germany 's three-tier educational system were optimistic about the future , while 57 percent of students at the academically more demanding " gymnasium " said they expected to fare well in life . girls take to the fast la n e bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are harder working than boys almost as striking as the discrepancy in outlook between students from the three different school types was the gender divide , with 7 percent more girls making the grade to " gymnasium " than boys and 55 percent of them aiming to leave school with a diploma compared to just 47 percent of their male peers . but both girls and boys showed a marked reluctance to start families , despite the fact that 72 percent agreed that family was important , and 39 percent thought marriage was " great . " " most of them are well aware that today it 's harder than ever to juggle education , a job , a career , a relationship and children , " said von der leyen . political a n d eco n omic fall-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disaffected young people are easily swayed by right-wing sloganeering her comments were reflected in further statistics contained in the study , which demonstrated a rise in psychological problems among both young people and their parents .
hurrelmann attributed this primarily to germany 's economic troubles . " financially weak parents can have problems raising children , " he said .
" but all of us - including economists - have to realize that badly brought up children are an economic disadvantage to the country . " equally , he added , they can be a political disadvantage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2006 possible presidential pardon reawakens memories of terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak of the raf terror campaign in the 1970s was marked by a spate of killings the german president may grant clemency to a controversial prisoner - a former top terrorist of the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- that unleashed a wave of terror in the 1970s and 80s . bomb attacks , kidnappings , shootings , hijackings , radical ideology and assassinations - the words are almost commonplace in today 's world plagued by global islamist terrorism .
but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .
nobody talks about this anymore , particularly after sept .
11 .
the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .
" it would be much more productive for the society to close this matter once and for all .

ten people survived with serious injuries . " there 's little hope of finding anyone alive in the wreckage , " said a police spokesman seven hours after the collision on an elevated test track in emsland , northern germany . in addition to merkel , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee interrupted a trip in china to return to germany .
the chancellor and german president horst köhler sent their condolences to the families of the victims and thanked those who took part in the rescue operations . transrapid crashed into maintenance train bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane lifts parts of the destroyed train on friday the magnetic levitation train was reported to be traveling at some 170 kilometers -lrb- 106 miles -rrb- per hour when it hit a maintenance train . what led to the accident remains unclear , but a spokesman for the operators of the track said initial investigations appeared to rule out a technical fault , indicating that human error was to blame . the maintenance train was tasked with the daily cleaning of the transrapid 's track and was supposed to be removed from the track before the transrapid starts on the 31.5-kilometer-long test track , which is four meters above the ground between dörpen and lathen close to the dutch border . " this accident would not have been possible if all regulations were adhered to , " said rudolf schwarz , head of operators iabg , who additionally pledged to clarify the circumstances surrounding the accident " as soon as possible . " some of the 29 passengers were family members and friends of employees who work for the firm that operates the track .
others worked for the energy provider rwe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2006 possible presidential pardon reawakens memories of terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak of the raf terror campaign in the 1970s was marked by a spate of killings the german president may grant clemency to a controversial prisoner - a former top terrorist of the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- that unleashed a wave of terror in the 1970s and 80s . bomb attacks , kidnappings , shootings , hijackings , radical ideology and assassinations - the words are almost commonplace in today 's world plagued by global islamist terrorism .
but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .

it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .

" there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .

the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .
nobody talks about this anymore , particularly after sept .

" the different cultures have more in common than political agitators would like us to believe , " steinmeier said on friday in new york .
" we have to do everything possible to avoid a new partitioning of the world into blocs that look hostilely at each other . " violence in the middle east and afghanistan as well as the international fight against terrorism should not be seen as a conflict of cultures or religions but as problems that need to be solved through dialog since " despite all our difference , we live in one world , " he added . the german minister also recalled the division of the world and his own country during the cold war , saying no other country had experienced being so deeply split as germany . history formed german foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of germany plays a major role in today 's politics , steinmeier said " walls and barbed wire straight through our country symbolized the division of europe and the world into two blocs until 1989 , " he said .
" since then germany has become a symbol of overcoming this division . " germany was politically influenced by the international partners who helped secure peace for 45 years , and that their influence was one of the reasons why germany is now taking on similar responsibilities in europe and other parts of the world , steinmeier said .

" give a clear sign of trust so that we can look forward together and can sit down at the negotiating table , " steinmeier said , calling the nuclear conflict with iran " urgent . " " no one wants to deny iran the right to use nuclear energy peacefully , nor is the objective of the diplomatic efforts to isolate iran , " he added . quartet should resume mideast peace efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy set sail for the middle east on thursday as expected , steinmeier also pushed the middle east quartet of the usa , the eu , russia and the united nations to restart its efforts for peace in the middle east while calling on nations there to put their animosities to rest . " whoever wants to make a life of peace instead of violence , safety instead of fear , prosperity instead of poverty possible for their children and grandchildren needs to have the courage to find new paths instead of maintaining old hostilities , " he added . after delivering one of the most anticipated speeches of the un 's meeting , steinmeier , who met with a number of world leaders during his four-day stay in new york , was scheduled to meet with other eu foreign ministers as well as us secretary of state condoleezza rice before returning to berlin on saturday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lawmakers give the go-ahead for lebanon mission germany 's parliament agreed wednesday to contribute naval and air force troops to a un force for lebanon in the first military deployment by germany in the middle east since world war ii .

" there is a hard core group of countries that are blocking , " said an eu diplomat , on condition of anonymity , after informal talks between the bloc 's justice and interior ministers in the southern finish city of tampere . the issue of national vetoes on cross-border police cooperation in criminal affairs has festered into a major obstacle to the european union 's security ambitions . while only around four of the 25 eu countries were against a move from unanimity decision-making to qualified majority voting to decide such matters , only three member states appeared to be fully in favor , diplomatic sources said . those states that diplomats most often named as being against the move included germany , the czech republic , ireland and malta , while france , luxembourg and spain were cited as most ready to take the leap . some countries fear that a change to majority voting would surrender control over or water down national security legislation .

" there is a hard core group of countries that are blocking , " said an eu diplomat , on condition of anonymity , after informal talks between the bloc 's justice and interior ministers in the southern finish city of tampere . the issue of national vetoes on cross-border police cooperation in criminal affairs has festered into a major obstacle to the european union 's security ambitions . while only around four of the 25 eu countries were against a move from unanimity decision-making to qualified majority voting to decide such matters , only three member states appeared to be fully in favor , diplomatic sources said . those states that diplomats most often named as being against the move included germany , the czech republic , ireland and malta , while france , luxembourg and spain were cited as most ready to take the leap . some countries fear that a change to majority voting would surrender control over or water down national security legislation .
others are concerned that it may conflict with their constitutions .
urgent need for change yet many countries agree there is urgent need for change , given the terror attacks in london and madrid and three foiled plots in europe this year , to ensure that draft legislation does not gather dust as it awaits unanimous endorsement . three years elapsed before a compromise was reached on a warrant easing the exchange of evidence between eu countries .
other projects have remained on hold for almost as long , including accords on common minimum rights for suspects , cross-border investigations and protecting information used for security purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid was hit by a terrorist attack in march 2004 " the fact that practical results are insufficient undermines the eu 's credibility at eu level both among citizens and civil servants , " said finnish interior minister kari rajamaki , co-hosting the talks as eu president . " what citizens expect of the eu is added value in security matters , especially in combating organized crime and terrorism , " he said . at a press conference after the talks , he and eu justice commissioner franco frattini refused to name the countries that were blocking , with rajamaki saying only that the results of the talks would now be analyzed . germany prefers reviving eu constitution many issues would have been resolved by the planned eu constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in may last year and fell into limbo as countries gave up ratifying it . in an effort to keep up with fast-evolving security needs , the european commission - the eu 's executive body - has urged members to use an article from a past treaty to move to so-called qualified majority voting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said germany 's not blocking unfortunately for those in favor of change , shifting to qualified majority voting - a system in which 62 percent of europe 's population must be represented - itself requires a unanimous decision . " the question is whether we can accept to take decisions that may be against our own interests , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , representing germany 's states at the talks , before friday 's meeting . " i 'm convinced that europe has not come far enough yet for us to arrive at any sort of majority decision now , " he said . germany argues that adopting such a system would undermine attempts to revive the constitution , which berlin has a mandate to take forward during its eu presidency , which starts in january . despite the fingers pointed in her direction , german justice minister brigitte zypries said : " no one can say that germany is blocking , " as 14 of the countries whose ministers spoke expressed doubts about abandoning unanimity . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de passenger profiling among eu 's proposed anti-terror measures the european commission said wednesday it would propose new counter-terrorism measures to detect liquid explosives , expand data sharing on airline passengers and train muslim preachers in european values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 22.09.2006 germany to push innovation with business partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one extra job in a high-tech industry can create up to 30 in supporting fields german research and education minister annette schavan has presented a plan to invest nearly 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- in high-tech industries .
she said the scheme could create 1.5 million new jobs . " when i said 1.5 million , that is not an exaggerated but an understated number , " schavan told parliamentarians thursday , adding that the number could be as high as 1.8 million , but that she was " being modest and saying 1.5 million . " the jobs would be the product of 14.6 billion euros the german government plans to invest in 17 " fields of innovation " by 2010 , schavan said .
about 90,000 of the new positions would be in the high-tech industries themselves with the others coming from businesses that support them , she added . most of the federal money is slated to go into the aerospace and energy sectors , although substantial amounts will also be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as bio and nano technologies . germany 's mp3 problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideas developed in germany are often marketed elsewhere the new funding plan focuses its attention on partnerships between research institutes and companies to help scientists receive feedback on the implementation possibilities of their work and to get their ideas into the market faster - an issue that has posed a problem for german researchers in the past .
the mp3 file format commonly used to save and play digital music , for example , was developed in germany but marketed by businesses outside of the country . although germany is ranked second in registered patents behind the united states , researchers say the path to the market needs to be streamlined and improved . " it is no longer among the german strengths to make market-ready innovations and sophisticated services from excellent ideas , " arend oetker , president of the association of foundations for german science , said in a statement tuesday . extra funding for working together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan said she wants new ideas to " ignite " in germany as part of the high-tech research funding plan , schavan 's ministry teamed up with the association to sponsor a contest that will award 250,000 euros to five universities for projects conducted in cooperation with companies .
the organizers issued a call for ideas on tuesday . the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association also welcomed the ministry 's decision to give priority to measures that cut the time it takes for research to hit the shelves . " we have to not only fill the research pipeline but also advocate for a quick implementation of technological opportunities in germany , " said edward krubasik , the group 's president .
" that is the only way we will create new sustainable domestic jobs . " a researcher friendly environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan wants more researchers to be working in germany the strategy also calls for germany to increase its public and private research spending from the current 2.5 percent to 3 percent of its gross domestic product over the next four years , a goal all european union members had previously said they would try to meet . " we are putting the switches in place to make germany a stronger growth motor for research in europe , " schavan said , adding that she wanted the country to become " one of the most researcher friendly countries in the world . " the growth is expected to come from aeronautics , pharmaceuticals , medical technology , logistics , and measurement and control technology , according to a 2006 report by the economic research company prognos , which said those industries are likely to grow in germany . doubts about new jobs remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies clustered in one area often share logistical benefits in the report , which drew attention to the concentration of germany 's high-tech companies in certain areas , prognos came to the conclusion that mainly the south of the country and a handful of northern cities have been benefiting from clusters of activity in their vicinities . the clusters , which often include a university or other research institute , work to combine knowledge in different fields to develop new products and gain an edge over international competitors . by 2030 , many of the products bearing the " made in germany " stamp will come from the high-tech industry as mass production continues leaving much of western europe for countries to the east that have lower labor costs , according to the report . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pours more money into high-tech berlin has announced it is investing 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.7 billion -rrb- in high-tech over the next three years .
germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 22.09.2006 long-awaited potsdam theater finally opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new hans otto theater reminds some of the sydney opera house the capital of brandenburg has waited a long time for a theater of its own .
but not everyone is convinced yet about gottfried böhm 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday . a pagoda , a lotus flower , a crumpled hat have been used to describe potsdam 's new hans otto theater , which opens friday .
the latest creation by architect gottfried böhm will be the scene of a gala weekend with five premieres over three days and a visit from german president horst köhler . theater director uwe eric laufenberg 's slogan is " people belong in the middle . "
the 2006-2007 program is n't just a bunch of short-lived trendy plays , he said , nor is it all conventional one either . potsdam , located just a hop and a skip outside of berlin , is due for a fresh theater .
the city , brandenburg 's state capital , has n't had a new one in 211 years and theater productions had to make do with temporary solutions for the past 60 years . years of provisional stages since its original theater am kanal was bombed in 1945 during world war ii , the theater company has performed in provisional buildings , including a dance hall , an unfinished structure commissioned by the east german government .
since 1992 , potsdam actors have appeared on the stage of a building affectionately called the " tin can . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt allegemeine zeitung called the theater " an idyll of listlessness " gottfried böhm 's 26-million-euro -lrb- $ 33 million -rrb- theater rests on the edge of a lake and can be accessed either by boat or from schiffbauergasse on the other side , a street that has become known as a cultural center . a native of cologne , böhm is the only german architect to have received the pritzker prize , which is described as the nobel prize for architecture .
the german architecture museum in frankfurt is featuring an exhibit on his works until nov .
5 . last minute adjustments böhm said the 484-seat hans otto theater was inspired by a trip he took to asia , which is apparent in the playfully layered , pagoda-like form .
he did n't have total freedom in the design , though : there was a land-marked gas holder on the site that he was obliged to integrate into the building . the theater , which laufenberg called " a new icon , " is n't quite complete .
the choice of building materials , mainly glass and steel , apparently do not provide for a suitable acoustic . experts are racing to reduce the reverberation in the hall to 1.4 seconds by friday 's gala premiere . but with a magnificent view of the lake and babelsberg castle behind it , the experience inside the theater wo n't be only about what comes from the stage . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the curtain opens on the 2006-2007 opera and theater season while a majority of the summer 's cultural events took place on open-air stages , as of september actors and singers are heading indoors to open the 2006-2007 opera and theater season .

she said the scheme could create 1.5 million new jobs . " when i said 1.5 million , that is not an exaggerated but an understated number , " schavan told parliamentarians thursday , adding that the number could be as high as 1.8 million , but that she was " being modest and saying 1.5 million . " the jobs would be the product of 14.6 billion euros the german government plans to invest in 17 " fields of innovation " by 2010 , schavan said .
about 90,000 of the new positions would be in the high-tech industries themselves with the others coming from businesses that support them , she added . most of the federal money is slated to go into the aerospace and energy sectors , although substantial amounts will also be directed toward health and medical research , environmental research as well as bio and nano technologies . germany 's mp3 problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideas developed in germany are often marketed elsewhere the new funding plan focuses its attention on partnerships between research institutes and companies to help scientists receive feedback on the implementation possibilities of their work and to get their ideas into the market faster - an issue that has posed a problem for german researchers in the past .
the mp3 file format commonly used to save and play digital music , for example , was developed in germany but marketed by businesses outside of the country . although germany is ranked second in registered patents behind the united states , researchers say the path to the market needs to be streamlined and improved . " it is no longer among the german strengths to make market-ready innovations and sophisticated services from excellent ideas , " arend oetker , president of the association of foundations for german science , said in a statement tuesday . extra funding for working together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan said she wants new ideas to " ignite " in germany as part of the high-tech research funding plan , schavan 's ministry teamed up with the association to sponsor a contest that will award 250,000 euros to five universities for projects conducted in cooperation with companies .
the organizers issued a call for ideas on tuesday . the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association also welcomed the ministry 's decision to give priority to measures that cut the time it takes for research to hit the shelves . " we have to not only fill the research pipeline but also advocate for a quick implementation of technological opportunities in germany , " said edward krubasik , the group 's president .
" that is the only way we will create new sustainable domestic jobs . " a researcher friendly environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan wants more researchers to be working in germany the strategy also calls for germany to increase its public and private research spending from the current 2.5 percent to 3 percent of its gross domestic product over the next four years , a goal all european union members had previously said they would try to meet . " we are putting the switches in place to make germany a stronger growth motor for research in europe , " schavan said , adding that she wanted the country to become " one of the most researcher friendly countries in the world . " the growth is expected to come from aeronautics , pharmaceuticals , medical technology , logistics , and measurement and control technology , according to a 2006 report by the economic research company prognos , which said those industries are likely to grow in germany . doubts about new jobs remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies clustered in one area often share logistical benefits in the report , which drew attention to the concentration of germany 's high-tech companies in certain areas , prognos came to the conclusion that mainly the south of the country and a handful of northern cities have been benefiting from clusters of activity in their vicinities . the clusters , which often include a university or other research institute , work to combine knowledge in different fields to develop new products and gain an edge over international competitors . by 2030 , many of the products bearing the " made in germany " stamp will come from the high-tech industry as mass production continues leaving much of western europe for countries to the east that have lower labor costs , according to the report . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pours more money into high-tech berlin has announced it is investing 14.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.7 billion -rrb- in high-tech over the next three years .
germany 's education and research minister says the goal is 1.5 million new jobs in high-tech fields .

" rather than creating absolute transparency , the law provides for all sorts of exceptions and back-door solutions , " he said , referring to paragraphs in the law that make it possible for authorities and food retailers to refuse to disclose information . changes likely after two-year test phase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 tons of spoiled meat were found in germany green party parliamentary leader and former consumer affairs minister renate künast told german public broadcaster ard that the new law is an improvement , but should have gone further by allowing consumers to get information directly from retail stores instead of inspection authorities . the german retailers association called for sparing use of the law saying premature or unproved reports should not be allowed to make consumers uneasy . representatives from germany 's federal states have said that the new guidelines are still not optimal and are likely to be improved after a two-year test phase . germany has been under pressure to get the law passed following the rancid meat scandals of late .

as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .
" different yardstick for managers " leading german politicians expressed outrage over the move .
social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group head peter struck said on wednesday it showed a lack of instinct , particularly at a time when many people are trying to ensure their survival by fighting for a minimum wage .

" employees can only interpret -lrb- the pay increase -rrb- in the sense that executives are measured using a different yardstick , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber , the head of the cdu 's sister party .
bavarian ig metall trade union boss , werner neugebauer said siemens could expect tough negotiations over cuts to the company 's it branch sbs as well as fujitsu siemens computers .
he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .
28 million euros , 12 men , one year criticism also came from the stock markets due to siemens ' weak developments there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , the best paid ceo of a germany company , is on siemens ' supervisory board " what is the shareholder supposed to think ?
at the end of the 2002/03 business year , the siemens share was listed at around 60 euros and since then has climbed by 12.3 percent , " market analyst heino ruland of brokerage steubing told reuters monday .
but over the same period , the dax went up by 82.3 percent . a siemens spokesman on wednesday said that it was normal practice to raise executives ' pay packages at regular intervals .
the company 's 12 executives were remunerated with around 28 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in cash and securities over the previous business year .

" the different cultures have more in common than political agitators would like us to believe , " steinmeier said on friday in new york .
" we have to do everything possible to avoid a new partitioning of the world into blocs that look hostilely at each other . " violence in the middle east and afghanistan as well as the international fight against terrorism should not be seen as a conflict of cultures or religions but as problems that need to be solved through dialog since " despite all our difference , we live in one world , " he added . the german minister also recalled the division of the world and his own country during the cold war , saying no other country had experienced being so deeply split as germany . history formed german foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of germany plays a major role in today 's politics , steinmeier said " walls and barbed wire straight through our country symbolized the division of europe and the world into two blocs until 1989 , " he said .
" since then germany has become a symbol of overcoming this division . " germany was politically influenced by the international partners who helped secure peace for 45 years , and that their influence was one of the reasons why germany is now taking on similar responsibilities in europe and other parts of the world , steinmeier said .

" give a clear sign of trust so that we can look forward together and can sit down at the negotiating table , " steinmeier said , calling the nuclear conflict with iran " urgent . " " no one wants to deny iran the right to use nuclear energy peacefully , nor is the objective of the diplomatic efforts to isolate iran , " he added . quartet should resume mideast peace efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy set sail for the middle east on thursday as expected , steinmeier also pushed the middle east quartet of the usa , the eu , russia and the united nations to restart its efforts for peace in the middle east while calling on nations there to put their animosities to rest . " whoever wants to make a life of peace instead of violence , safety instead of fear , prosperity instead of poverty possible for their children and grandchildren needs to have the courage to find new paths instead of maintaining old hostilities , " he added . after delivering one of the most anticipated speeches of the un 's meeting , steinmeier , who met with a number of world leaders during his four-day stay in new york , was scheduled to meet with other eu foreign ministers as well as us secretary of state condoleezza rice before returning to berlin on saturday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lawmakers give the go-ahead for lebanon mission germany 's parliament agreed wednesday to contribute naval and air force troops to a un force for lebanon in the first military deployment by germany in the middle east since world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2006 possible presidential pardon reawakens memories of terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak of the raf terror campaign in the 1970s was marked by a spate of killings the german president may grant clemency to a controversial prisoner - a former top terrorist of the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- that unleashed a wave of terror in the 1970s and 80s . bomb attacks , kidnappings , shootings , hijackings , radical ideology and assassinations - the words are almost commonplace in today 's world plagued by global islamist terrorism .
but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .
nobody talks about this anymore , particularly after sept .
11 .
the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .

the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past .

" there is a hard core group of countries that are blocking , " said an eu diplomat , on condition of anonymity , after informal talks between the bloc 's justice and interior ministers in the southern finish city of tampere . the issue of national vetoes on cross-border police cooperation in criminal affairs has festered into a major obstacle to the european union 's security ambitions . while only around four of the 25 eu countries were against a move from unanimity decision-making to qualified majority voting to decide such matters , only three member states appeared to be fully in favor , diplomatic sources said . those states that diplomats most often named as being against the move included germany , the czech republic , ireland and malta , while france , luxembourg and spain were cited as most ready to take the leap . some countries fear that a change to majority voting would surrender control over or water down national security legislation .
others are concerned that it may conflict with their constitutions .
urgent need for change yet many countries agree there is urgent need for change , given the terror attacks in london and madrid and three foiled plots in europe this year , to ensure that draft legislation does not gather dust as it awaits unanimous endorsement . three years elapsed before a compromise was reached on a warrant easing the exchange of evidence between eu countries .
other projects have remained on hold for almost as long , including accords on common minimum rights for suspects , cross-border investigations and protecting information used for security purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madrid was hit by a terrorist attack in march 2004 " the fact that practical results are insufficient undermines the eu 's credibility at eu level both among citizens and civil servants , " said finnish interior minister kari rajamaki , co-hosting the talks as eu president .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagendijk said turkey must amend article 301 " i am happy for shafak , but i believe article 301 must be amended , " joost lagendijk , a senior member of the european parliament , said after the hearing which he followed as an observer .
" if not , there will be similar cases .
only the amendment of the article will satisfy the european union . " his comments were echoed by the eu executive . " the commission welcomes this recent judgment , this is obviously good news , " the european commission 's enlargement spokeswoman krisztina nagy said in brussels .
she added , however , that " a significant threat to freedom of expression " remains in turkish law and urged amendments in article 301 and other " vague " penal code provisions .
charges focused o n fictio n al character shafak , who gave birth to her first child last week , was not present in the courtroom . her trial added a bizarre twist to article 301 because the charges stemmed not from a public statement by the defendant as in other cases , but from lines uttered by shafak 's fictional armenian characters in " the bastard of istanbul . "
one of the book 's characters speaks of " turkish butchers " and of a " genocide " while others talk about being " slaughtered like sheep " during the 1915-1917 massacres . erdogan said his government was ready to discuss proposals to amend article 301 as he welcomed shafak 's acquittal . " the ruling party and the opposition can sit down together again to discuss this issue as laws are not eternal , " he said in ankara . no one has yet been imprisoned under the article , but the appeals court in july confirmed the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting a precedent . on nov .
8 , the european commission will issue a key report on turkey 's progress towards membership , which is expected to be critical of the pace of reform .
" culture of ly n chi n g " shafak also hailed her acquittal , but expressed concern that " a culture of lynching " was emerging in turkey at a time when respect for dissenting views is crucial to boost the country 's democratic credentials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author orhan pamuk has also been brought to court under article 301 " i am concerned about an idea that has recently developed in turkey , the idea that ' those who do not think like us are cooperating with the enemy , " ' she told ntv television . she was referring to a group of nationalist lawyers who instigated the charges against her , the latest in its relentless campaign to pursue before the courts intellectuals who dispute the official line on the armenian massacres . members of the group , which many say is aiming to undermine turkey 's eu bid , engaged in short-lived scuffles with supporters of shafak outside the courtroom .
police immediately stepped in and detained two people , ntv said . shafak 's novel takes place in istanbul and san francisco and recounts the stories of four generations of turkish women and an american-armenian family , the descendants of survivors of the massacres . armenians assert that up to 1.5 million of their people were slaughtered in what was genocide between 1915 and 1917 , as the ottoman empire , modern turkey 's predecessor , was falling apart . categorically rejecting the genocide label , turkey argues that 300,000 armenians and at least as many turks died in civil strife when armenians took up arms for independence in eastern anatolia and sided with invading russian troops . much to ankara 's ire , the massacres have been recognized as genocide by many countries .
last year , germany 's parliament condemned the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians by turks in 1915-1916 , though it avoided using the term " genocide . " a taboo for decades , the armenian killings have only recently become the subject of a tentative public debate , often sending nationalists into a frenzy . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey .

as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .
" different yardstick for managers " leading german politicians expressed outrage over the move .
social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group head peter struck said on wednesday it showed a lack of instinct , particularly at a time when many people are trying to ensure their survival by fighting for a minimum wage .
spd secretary general hubertus heil said the executives filled their own pockets with no regard for employees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierer says his executives should earn more saarland premier peter müller , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said it was incomprehensible why companies continued to expect sacrifices from employees while adding to managers pay packages to such an extent . " employees can only interpret -lrb- the pay increase -rrb- in the sense that executives are measured using a different yardstick , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber , the head of the cdu 's sister party .
bavarian ig metall trade union boss , werner neugebauer said siemens could expect tough negotiations over cuts to the company 's it branch sbs as well as fujitsu siemens computers .
he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .
28 million euros , 12 men , one year criticism also came from the stock markets due to siemens ' weak developments there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , the best paid ceo of a germany company , is on siemens ' supervisory board " what is the shareholder supposed to think ?
at the end of the 2002/03 business year , the siemens share was listed at around 60 euros and since then has climbed by 12.3 percent , " market analyst heino ruland of brokerage steubing told reuters monday .
but over the same period , the dax went up by 82.3 percent . a siemens spokesman on wednesday said that it was normal practice to raise executives ' pay packages at regular intervals .
the company 's 12 executives were remunerated with around 28 million euros -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in cash and securities over the previous business year .
ceo klaus kleinfeld was paid nearly 3.3 million euros alone . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief ackermann stays on top germany 's biggest bank has extended chief executive josef ackermann 's contract until 2010 .

as the next round of collective bargaining between union representatives and management looms , the plans could cause a boomerang effect , said wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of erlangen / nuremberg . " the employees at siemens in collective negotiations will now point to management helping itself to 30 percent more and that one should also like to be taken into account , " gerke told dw-tv on friday .
" one ca n't let 5,400 employees go on the one hand , make no extraordinary profits and at the same time give top management 30 percent higher salaries , " he added .
pay raises should be used to increase motivation or as rewards , gerke said . siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer had told der spiegel magazine last weekend that he had decided to increase the managing board members ' pay because he determined it was low in comparison to germany 's other leading companies .
the firm 's executives have n't enjoyed a pay hike in three years .
" different yardstick for managers " leading german politicians expressed outrage over the move .
social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group head peter struck said on wednesday it showed a lack of instinct , particularly at a time when many people are trying to ensure their survival by fighting for a minimum wage .

he said the pay raises were excessive and unconscionable . " the siemens managing board apparently has a strange understanding of globalization : manager salaries like in the usa , corporate taxes like in cyprus and , for the employees , salaries like in china , " he said .
28 million euros , 12 men , one year criticism also came from the stock markets due to siemens ' weak developments there .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .
" the raf are leftovers of an ideological turmoil of the 1960s .
nobody talks about this anymore , particularly after sept .
11 .
the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .
this has placed a particular " burden " on the issue , könen said . thus , germans still do n't know who killed industrialist ernst zimmermann , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts , top foreign ministry official gerold von braunmühl , deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen or detlev karsten rohwedder , leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . " there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past . " that 's why it 's all the more important that we finally draw a line under it , " he said .
" it would be much more productive for the society to close this matter once and for all .

but they were also the hallmarks of the campaign of militant violence unleashed by germany 's homegrown terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . born out of the student protest movement of the late 1960s , the radical leftist red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- group kidnapped and killed prominent establishment figures in germany in the name of class struggle and left-wing idealism .
the brutal campaign and the west german state 's heavy-handed response polarized the postwar generation . now , nearly 30 years after the so-called " german autumn " of 1977 , which ended with the suicides of the raf 's core leadership and the brutal kidnapping and murder of the president of the german employers ' association , hanns martin schleyer , the turbulent period in german history may be heading towards the final chapter . a preside n tial pardo n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president köhler may pardon christian klar german president horst köhler has indicated that he may grant clemency to christian klar , one of the four remaining raf members still being held in prison .
a spokesman from the german president 's office confirmed that the president had requested the german justice ministry for a statement on the case . klar , now 54 , was convicted in 1985 during the infamous stammheim trial in stuttgart for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder .
he was sentenced to life imprisonment . like much of the raf rank , klar came from the wealthy southwest , from a middle class family in freiburg .
angered by the punishing prison conditions meted out to the group 's inmates , klar joined the guerrilla group in 1976 when he went to karlsruhe to study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar at a court in stuttgart in 1992 " klar was a classic example of the second raf generation from the karlsruhe scene that was exclusively organized against the city 's main court and several other state institutions , " said gerd könen , a frankfurt-based historian who has written several books about the raf . karlsruhe is home to germany 's highest court . " he was obviously a central figure who played a role in a series of key assassinations , " könen said . klar was found to be involved in the assassination of federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , the killing of banker jürgen ponto and the kidnapping of schleyer . " a ghost from the past " klar , who applied for clemency after a television interview , has said he 's ready to express regret to the relatives of raf victims for whom the consequences of the war , which german author heinrich böll famously called " six against 60 million , " were all too real .
the raf killed more than 30 people during their armed struggle against the west german state . the former top terrorist however stands a good chance of being released earlier than 2008 - the earliest date by which he can be freed according to his verdict . since reunification in 1990 , germany 's presidents have set a precedent of pardoning former raf killers .
eight have been released from prison ever since , the last by köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police launched a massive manhunt for raf members in the 70s and 80s with mugshots of suspects willi winkler , a journalist and writer who is working on a book about the raf , said for many in germany , the radical left-wing group was already history . " christian klar is a ghost from the past , " he said .

the threat of islamist terrorism today is quite different . " " keeper of the flame " in europe , left-wing terrorism erupted in italy and greece in the 1970s too , but it lasted the longest in germany - well into the early 1990s .
it may no longer pose a threat anymore , but a presidential pardon for klar would still draw attention to the remaining three raf prisoners - all of them women who have been sentenced to life imprisonment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown signs of regret among them , 57-year-old brigitte mohnhaupt , who has spent the past 28 years behind bars , is the most enigmatic .
the head of the schleyer kidnapping and killing operation in 1977 , which was meant to raise pressure on the german government to release raf prisoners , mohnhaupt has cloaked herself in silence ever since her conviction .
unlike other former raf members , she has refused to talk to journalists or apply for clemency . " mohnhaupt is a hardliner and she can never be pardoned because she has never shown any signs of contrition and has refused to talk to the authorities , " winkler said .
" in a way , she 's the real keeper of the flame . " " a se n se of the u n resolved " it 's no secret that the four remaining raf prisoners were punished particularly severely for refusing to cooperate with the authorities and divulge information .
german authorities have failed to solve the last five murders which the raf owned up to .

" there 's this sense of the unresolved about the whole thing , even in a purely criminal and legal sense , " said könen , adding that pardoning klar would also bring germany closer to finally closing the book on a painful past .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagendijk said turkey must amend article 301 " i am happy for shafak , but i believe article 301 must be amended , " joost lagendijk , a senior member of the european parliament , said after the hearing which he followed as an observer .
" if not , there will be similar cases .
only the amendment of the article will satisfy the european union . " his comments were echoed by the eu executive . " the commission welcomes this recent judgment , this is obviously good news , " the european commission 's enlargement spokeswoman krisztina nagy said in brussels .
she added , however , that " a significant threat to freedom of expression " remains in turkish law and urged amendments in article 301 and other " vague " penal code provisions .
charges focused o n fictio n al character shafak , who gave birth to her first child last week , was not present in the courtroom . her trial added a bizarre twist to article 301 because the charges stemmed not from a public statement by the defendant as in other cases , but from lines uttered by shafak 's fictional armenian characters in " the bastard of istanbul . "
one of the book 's characters speaks of " turkish butchers " and of a " genocide " while others talk about being " slaughtered like sheep " during the 1915-1917 massacres . erdogan said his government was ready to discuss proposals to amend article 301 as he welcomed shafak 's acquittal . " the ruling party and the opposition can sit down together again to discuss this issue as laws are not eternal , " he said in ankara . no one has yet been imprisoned under the article , but the appeals court in july confirmed the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting a precedent . on nov .
8 , the european commission will issue a key report on turkey 's progress towards membership , which is expected to be critical of the pace of reform .
" culture of ly n chi n g " shafak also hailed her acquittal , but expressed concern that " a culture of lynching " was emerging in turkey at a time when respect for dissenting views is crucial to boost the country 's democratic credentials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author orhan pamuk has also been brought to court under article 301 " i am concerned about an idea that has recently developed in turkey , the idea that ' those who do not think like us are cooperating with the enemy , " ' she told ntv television . she was referring to a group of nationalist lawyers who instigated the charges against her , the latest in its relentless campaign to pursue before the courts intellectuals who dispute the official line on the armenian massacres . members of the group , which many say is aiming to undermine turkey 's eu bid , engaged in short-lived scuffles with supporters of shafak outside the courtroom .
police immediately stepped in and detained two people , ntv said . shafak 's novel takes place in istanbul and san francisco and recounts the stories of four generations of turkish women and an american-armenian family , the descendants of survivors of the massacres . armenians assert that up to 1.5 million of their people were slaughtered in what was genocide between 1915 and 1917 , as the ottoman empire , modern turkey 's predecessor , was falling apart . categorically rejecting the genocide label , turkey argues that 300,000 armenians and at least as many turks died in civil strife when armenians took up arms for independence in eastern anatolia and sided with invading russian troops . much to ankara 's ire , the massacres have been recognized as genocide by many countries .
last year , germany 's parliament condemned the systematic murder of 1.5 million armenians by turks in 1915-1916 , though it avoided using the term " genocide . " a taboo for decades , the armenian killings have only recently become the subject of a tentative public debate , often sending nationalists into a frenzy . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " a great day for orhan , but we have to go on pushing " on a book tour in germany promoting his latest novel " shalimar the clown , " acclaimed writer salman rushdie talked to dw-world about his kashmiri origins , ignored conflicts and the triumph for freedom of speech in turkey .

page last updated at 04:50 gmt , friday , 22 september 2006 05:50 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version scams steal £ 8.4bn from taxpayer by james oliver panorama website exclusive see how the " carousel fraud " scam works british taxpayers have lost a " catastrophic " £ 8.4bn to vat fraudsters in 12 months , according to the results of a report obtained by panorama .
the figures claim that the uk lost five times more money to vat cheats than any other eu country between june 2005 and june 2006 .
the estimates from a belgian taskforce created to fight fraud are much higher than the last published uk estimates .
but the uk government said it did not recognise the figures in the report .
the government 's own figures put vat fraud losses at as much as £ 1.9bn for 2004/05 .
chancellor gordon brown 's 2005/06 estimates are not due until the publication of his pre-budget report later this year .
accurate estimate the belgian figures come from a taskforce which includes government ministers and is called ondersteuningscel in dutch or cellule de soutien in french .

herve jamar is the belgian state secretary with responsibility for dealing with vat fraud .
he worked on the report and said britain has a " unique problem " .
" we estimate the loss to britain to amount to 3.7bn euros with the dubai connection adding some 8bn euros to this figure .
it 's clear there are very close commercial links between britain and dubai .
belgian state secretary herve jamar worked on the report and says the uk has a " unique problem " " we 've made these calculations using very specific criteria , based on data we 've collected and based on risk analysis .
as a result , we 've achieved much more realistic figures .
" and this work was done by police who specialise in tax fraud , in collaboration with other organisations .
our approach to this is therefore very objective . "
vat " carousel fraud " is also called missing trader intra-community fraud -lrb- mtic -rrb- .
it involves the repeated import and export of small , high value goods such as computer chips and mobile phones .
under european trading rules a uk company importing the goods does not have to pay vat but charges it to the next british company it sells the goods on to .
the goods are then exported before being re-imported .
what is carousel fraud ?
small high-value goods , such as mobile phones , are imported free of vat from eu countries and sold with 17.5 % tax added in the uk .
instead of handing the vat to the government , the importing company run by criminals is shut down and the cash is kept by the importers .
this loss of tax is often compounded when the new owners of the goods export them again and can legally reclaim the vat they paid .
goods go round in a " carousel " via bogus supply chains within and beyond the eu because they are repeatedly imported and exported .
by exporting the goods to dubai , the fraudsters break the evidential chain making the fraud harder to detect .
each time the goods go round the carousel , the vat that should be paid to hm revenue and customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- goes missing .
the fraud first emerged in the mid-1990s but has exploded over the past year in the uk as criminals have exploited what law enforcement officials call the " dubai connection " .
this involves exporting the goods to dubai , which is outside the single market , before sending them back into the eu and round the carousel again .
by exporting the goods to dubai , the fraudsters break the evidential chain making the fraud harder to detect .
according to the belgian study , almost three quarters of the tax stolen by the fraudsters in the uk between june 2005 and june 2006 involved carousel frauds using the dubai connection .
from december , a new vat system aimed at stopping the scam will be introduced .
called a " reverse charge " , it means that for certain electronic goods only the final retailer will be able to levy vat .
it aims to stop the criminals stealing vat charged on goods imported free of the tax from elsewhere in the eu .
the paymaster general , dawn primarolo told bbc news 24 that the government rejected belgium claims that britain had lost £ 8.4bn of revenue to tax fraudsters .
" the government was n't involved in the compiling of this report and it simply is n't credible to accept the figures that are present in this report reflect a true picture .
" we 've led the debate in the european union of what 's necessary in order to prevent and frustrate these attempts at stealing money and it ¿ s very important to keep it in that context . "
a treasury spokesperson told panorama that fraud estimates had been published for the past five years , and would be updated in the next pre-budget report .
" we can not comment on the substance of this report and we do not recognise the figures that are set out for the uk , " he said .
this fraud is widely acknowledged as a problem across the eu uk treasury " however , mtic fraud is widely acknowledged as a problem across the eu and we continue to work closely with our european partners to counter it . "
" more than 1,400 hmrc officers are now involved in tackling carousel fraud .
" in response to the recent increase in attempted fraud , hmrc has significantly strengthened this strategy through a combination of legislation , litigation and operational activity , " the spokesperson said .
" recent operational data and trade figures show a significant reduction in the level of trading associated with mtic fraud , and we are confident that this trend will continue , assisted by the forthcoming introduction of the reverse charge . "

vat " carousel fraud " is also called missing trader intra-community fraud -lrb- mtic -rrb- .
it involves the repeated import and export of small , high value goods such as computer chips and mobile phones .

the goods are then exported before being re-imported .
what is carousel fraud ?
small high-value goods , such as mobile phones , are imported free of vat from eu countries and sold with 17.5 % tax added in the uk .
instead of handing the vat to the government , the importing company run by criminals is shut down and the cash is kept by the importers .
this loss of tax is often compounded when the new owners of the goods export them again and can legally reclaim the vat they paid .
goods go round in a " carousel " via bogus supply chains within and beyond the eu because they are repeatedly imported and exported .
by exporting the goods to dubai , the fraudsters break the evidential chain making the fraud harder to detect .
each time the goods go round the carousel , the vat that should be paid to hm revenue and customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- goes missing .
the fraud first emerged in the mid-1990s but has exploded over the past year in the uk as criminals have exploited what law enforcement officials call the " dubai connection " .
this involves exporting the goods to dubai , which is outside the single market , before sending them back into the eu and round the carousel again .
by exporting the goods to dubai , the fraudsters break the evidential chain making the fraud harder to detect .
according to the belgian study , almost three quarters of the tax stolen by the fraudsters in the uk between june 2005 and june 2006 involved carousel frauds using the dubai connection .
from december , a new vat system aimed at stopping the scam will be introduced .
called a " reverse charge " , it means that for certain electronic goods only the final retailer will be able to levy vat .
it aims to stop the criminals stealing vat charged on goods imported free of the tax from elsewhere in the eu .
the paymaster general , dawn primarolo told bbc news 24 that the government rejected belgium claims that britain had lost £ 8.4bn of revenue to tax fraudsters .
" the government was n't involved in the compiling of this report and it simply is n't credible to accept the figures that are present in this report reflect a true picture .
" we 've led the debate in the european union of what 's necessary in order to prevent and frustrate these attempts at stealing money and it ¿ s very important to keep it in that context . "
a treasury spokesperson told panorama that fraud estimates had been published for the past five years , and would be updated in the next pre-budget report .
" we can not comment on the substance of this report and we do not recognise the figures that are set out for the uk , " he said .
this fraud is widely acknowledged as a problem across the eu uk treasury " however , mtic fraud is widely acknowledged as a problem across the eu and we continue to work closely with our european partners to counter it . "
" more than 1,400 hmrc officers are now involved in tackling carousel fraud .
" in response to the recent increase in attempted fraud , hmrc has significantly strengthened this strategy through a combination of legislation , litigation and operational activity , " the spokesperson said .
" recent operational data and trade figures show a significant reduction in the level of trading associated with mtic fraud , and we are confident that this trend will continue , assisted by the forthcoming introduction of the reverse charge . "

he worked on the report and said britain has a " unique problem " .
" we estimate the loss to britain to amount to 3.7bn euros with the dubai connection adding some 8bn euros to this figure .
it 's clear there are very close commercial links between britain and dubai .
" we 've made these calculations using very specific criteria , based on data we 've collected and based on risk analysis .
as a result , we 've achieved much more realistic figures .
" and this work was done by police who specialise in tax fraud , in collaboration with other organisations .
our approach to this is therefore very objective . "
vat " carousel fraud " is also called missing trader intra-community fraud -lrb- mtic -rrb- .
it involves the repeated import and export of small , high value goods such as computer chips and mobile phones .
under european trading rules a uk company importing the goods does not have to pay vat but charges it to the next british company it sells the goods on to .
the goods are then exported before being re-imported .
what is carousel fraud ?
small high-value goods , such as mobile phones , are imported free of vat from eu countries and sold with 17.5 % tax added in the uk .
instead of handing the vat to the government , the importing company run by criminals is shut down and the cash is kept by the importers .
this loss of tax is often compounded when the new owners of the goods export them again and can legally reclaim the vat they paid .
goods go round in a " carousel " via bogus supply chains within and beyond the eu because they are repeatedly imported and exported .
by exporting the goods to dubai , the fraudsters break the evidential chain making the fraud harder to detect .
each time the goods go round the carousel , the vat that should be paid to hm revenue and customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- goes missing .
the fraud first emerged in the mid-1990s but has exploded over the past year in the uk as criminals have exploited what law enforcement officials call the " dubai connection " .
this involves exporting the goods to dubai , which is outside the single market , before sending them back into the eu and round the carousel again .
by exporting the goods to dubai , the fraudsters break the evidential chain making the fraud harder to detect .
according to the belgian study , almost three quarters of the tax stolen by the fraudsters in the uk between june 2005 and june 2006 involved carousel frauds using the dubai connection .
from december , a new vat system aimed at stopping the scam will be introduced .
called a " reverse charge " , it means that for certain electronic goods only the final retailer will be able to levy vat .
it aims to stop the criminals stealing vat charged on goods imported free of the tax from elsewhere in the eu .
the paymaster general , dawn primarolo told bbc news 24 that the government rejected belgium claims that britain had lost £ 8.4bn of revenue to tax fraudsters .
" the government was n't involved in the compiling of this report and it simply is n't credible to accept the figures that are present in this report reflect a true picture .
" we 've led the debate in the european union of what 's necessary in order to prevent and frustrate these attempts at stealing money and it ¿ s very important to keep it in that context . "
a treasury spokesperson told panorama that fraud estimates had been published for the past five years , and would be updated in the next pre-budget report .
" we can not comment on the substance of this report and we do not recognise the figures that are set out for the uk , " he said . "
this fraud is widely acknowledged as a problem across the eu " uk treasury " however , mtic fraud is widely acknowledged as a problem across the eu and we continue to work closely with our european partners to counter it . "
" more than 1,400 hmrc officers are now involved in tackling carousel fraud .
" in response to the recent increase in attempted fraud , hmrc has significantly strengthened this strategy through a combination of legislation , litigation and operational activity , " the spokesperson said .
" recent operational data and trade figures show a significant reduction in the level of trading associated with mtic fraud , and we are confident that this trend will continue , assisted by the forthcoming introduction of the reverse charge . "

the days of chips with everything are over three weeks into the new school term , there 's just one thing that many pupils and their parents are talking about .

dyffryn house in the vale of glamorgan is undergoing £ 1m of renovations to bring it back to its former glory .
but work on the grade ii listed building is having to be rushed over the winter months to ensure the bats are not disturbed .
the building , which has been empty for a number of years , is the home to colonies of several species of bat .
architect nick lloyd from the vale of glamorgan council explained : " dyffryn house has bats in its roof space and has done for a number of years .
" roosting bats are protected by law so the work in dyffryn house has been timed to suit the bats .
" we are going to do the work during the winter months and will probably start in the next few weeks . "
the 18th century house is famed for its edwardian gardens which have been listed as grade i in cadw 's register of landscapes , parks and gardens of special historic interest in wales .
work is currently underway on restoring the gardens to the landscape architect thomas mawson designed for john cory in 1906 .
in 2005 , its owner , the vale of glamorgan council , announced it would spend £ 1m restoring the house .
this work includes re-roofing the building .
bat dormers " the process over the winter months is to ensure that the bats do n't hibernate in the roof , " explained mr lloyd .
" but we are putting in quite a few measures to encourage them to return when the work is done .
" it includes installing bat dormers that allows the bats to enter the roof space .
" the work is due to start in the next few weeks and is timed to last until march with the majority of the work being done in that time . "
there are several colonies such as the long-eared brown bat , the lesser horseshoe bat and the pipistrelle living in the roof space at dyffryn house .

the cyclone , a feature at pleasureland amusement park in southport , is under threat of demolition after the park closed earlier this month .
owners blackpool pleasure beach said it was " unsustainable " as a ride park .
supporters of the ride asked english heritage to have the ride protected but the application was refused .
a statement from the organisation said : " the cyclone is not the oldest rollercoaster of its type and is not part of a wider group of historically significant entertainment buildings - an important factor when assessing whether a building or structure is listable .
" we are saddened that buildings and structures do n't have stronger protection while they are being considered for listing , but we hope this will be reviewed in forthcoming changes to the heritage protection system . "
the amusement park first opened with a figure-of-eight rollercoaster and a slide back in 1913 .

although iran and israel are bitter enemies , few know that iran is home to the largest number of jews anywhere in the middle east outside israel .
about 25,000 jews live in iran and most are determined to remain no matter what the pressures - as proud of their iranian culture as of their jewish roots .
it is dawn in the yusufabad synagogue in tehran and iranian jews bring out the torah and read the ancient text before making their way to work .
it is not a sight you would expect in a revolutionary islamic state , but there are synagogues dotted all over iran where jews discreetly practise their religion .
" because of our long history here we are tolerated , " says jewish community leader unees hammami , who organised the prayers .
he says the father of iran 's revolution , imam khomeini , recognised jews as a religious minority that should be protected .
as a result jews have one representative in the iranian parliament .
" imam khomeini made a distinction between jews and zionists and he supported us , " says mr hammami .
' anti-jewish feeling ' in the yusufabad synagogue the announcements are made in persian - most iranian jews do n't really speak hebrew well .
jews have lived in persia for nearly 3,000 years - the descendants of slaves from babylon saved by cyrus the great .
over the centuries there have been sporadic purges , pogroms and forced conversions to islam as well as periods of peaceful co-existence .
these days anti-jewish feeling is periodically stirred by the media .
whatever they say abroad is lies - we are comfortable in iran - if you 're not political and do n't bother them then they wo n't bother you hersel gabriel mr hammami says state-run television confuses zionism and judaism so that " ordinary people may think that whatever the israelis do is supported by all jews " .
during the fighting in lebanon a hardline weekly newspaper , yalesarat , published two photographs of synagogues on its front page full of people waving israeli flags celebrating israeli independence day .
the paper falsely said the synagogues were in iran - even describing one as the yusufabad synagogue in tehran and locating another in shiraz .
" this provoked a number of opportunists in shiraz , " explains iran 's jewish mp , maurice mohtamed , " and there was an assault on two synagogues . "
mr mohtamed says the incident was defused by the iranian security forces , who explained to people that the news was not true .
and with the coming to power of an ultra-conservative like president mahmoud ahmadinejad , there has been increased concern internationally about the fate of iranian jews .
' holocaust denial ' mr ahmedinejad has repeatedly used rabid anti-israeli rhetoric - slogans like " wipe israel off the map " - and most controversially he has questioned the number killed in the holocaust during world war ii .
mr mohtamed has been outspoken in his condemnation of the president 's views - in itself a sign that there is some space for jews in iran to express themselves .
president ahmedinejad has repeatedly used anti-israeli rhetoric " it 's very regrettable to see a horrible tragedy so far reaching as the holocaust being denied ... it was a very big insult to jews all around the world , " says mr mohtamed , who has also strongly condemned the exhibition of cartoons about the holocaust organised by an iranian newspaper owned by the tehran municipality .
despite the offence mahmoud ahmedinejad has caused to jews around the world , his office recently donated money for tehran 's jewish hospital .
it is one of only four jewish charity hospitals worldwide and is funded with money from the jewish diaspora - something remarkable in iran where even local aid organisations have difficulty receiving funds from abroad for fear of being accused of being foreign agents .
most of the patients and staff are muslim these days , but director ciamak morsathegh is jewish .
" anti-semitism is not an eastern phenomenon , it 's not an islamic or iranian phenomenon - anti-semitism is a european phenomenon , " he says , arguing that jews in iran even in their worst days never suffered as much as they did in europe .
israeli family ties but there are legal problems for jews in iran - if one member of a jewish family converts to islam he can inherit all the family 's property .
jews can not become army officers and the headmasters of the jewish schools in tehran are all muslim , though there is no law that says this should be so .
but their greatest vulnerability is their links to israel - where many jews have relatives .
seven years ago a group of jews in the southern city of shiraz was accused of spying for israel - eventually they were all released .
but today many iranian jews travel to and from iran 's enemy israel .
an anti-israeli ' holocaust cartoon contest ' was held in tehran in one of tehran 's six remaining kosher butcher 's shops , everyone has relatives in israel .
in between chopping up meat , butcher hersel gabriel tells me how he expected problems when he came back from israel , but in fact the immigration officer did n't say anything to him .
" whatever they say abroad is lies - we are comfortable in iran - if you 're not political and do n't bother them then they wo n't bother you , " he explains .
his customer , middle-aged housewife giti agrees , saying she can easily talk to her two sons in tel aviv on the telephone and visit them .
" it 's not a problem coming and going ; i went to israel once through turkey and once through cyprus and it was not problem at all , " she says .
gone are the early days of the iranian revolution when jews - and many muslims - found it hard to get passports to travel abroad .
" in the last five years the government has allowed iranian jews to go to israel freely , meet their families and when they come back they face no problems , " says mr mohtamed .
he says there is also a way for iranian jews who emigrated to israel decades ago to return to iran and see their families .
" they can now go to the iranian consul general in istanbul and get iranian identity documents and freely come to iran , " he says .
the exodus of jews from iran seems to have slowed down - the first wave was in the 1950s and the second was in the wake of the iranian revolution .
those jews who remain in iran seem to have made a conscious decision to stay put .
" we are iranian and we have been living in iran for more than 3,000 years , " says the jewish hospital director ciamak morsathegh .
" i am not going to leave - i will stay in iran under any conditions , " he declares .

" this provoked a number of opportunists in shiraz , " explains iran 's jewish mp , maurice mohtamed , " and there was an assault on two synagogues . "
mr mohtamed says the incident was defused by the iranian security forces , who explained to people that the news was not true .
and with the coming to power of an ultra-conservative like president mahmoud ahmadinejad , there has been increased concern internationally about the fate of iranian jews .
' holocaust denial ' mr ahmedinejad has repeatedly used rabid anti-israeli rhetoric - slogans like " wipe israel off the map " - and most controversially he has questioned the number killed in the holocaust during world war ii .
mr mohtamed has been outspoken in his condemnation of the president 's views - in itself a sign that there is some space for jews in iran to express themselves .
president ahmedinejad has repeatedly used anti-israeli rhetoric " it 's very regrettable to see a horrible tragedy so far reaching as the holocaust being denied ... it was a very big insult to jews all around the world , " says mr mohtamed , who has also strongly condemned the exhibition of cartoons about the holocaust organised by an iranian newspaper owned by the tehran municipality .
despite the offence mahmoud ahmedinejad has caused to jews around the world , his office recently donated money for tehran 's jewish hospital .
it is one of only four jewish charity hospitals worldwide and is funded with money from the jewish diaspora - something remarkable in iran where even local aid organisations have difficulty receiving funds from abroad for fear of being accused of being foreign agents .
most of the patients and staff are muslim these days , but director ciamak morsathegh is jewish .
" anti-semitism is not an eastern phenomenon , it 's not an islamic or iranian phenomenon - anti-semitism is a european phenomenon , " he says , arguing that jews in iran even in their worst days never suffered as much as they did in europe .
israeli family ties but there are legal problems for jews in iran - if one member of a jewish family converts to islam he can inherit all the family 's property .
jews can not become army officers and the headmasters of the jewish schools in tehran are all muslim , though there is no law that says this should be so .
but their greatest vulnerability is their links to israel - where many jews have relatives .
seven years ago a group of jews in the southern city of shiraz was accused of spying for israel - eventually they were all released .
but today many iranian jews travel to and from iran 's enemy israel .
an anti-israeli ' holocaust cartoon contest ' was held in tehran in one of tehran 's six remaining kosher butcher 's shops , everyone has relatives in israel .
in between chopping up meat , butcher hersel gabriel tells me how he expected problems when he came back from israel , but in fact the immigration officer did n't say anything to him .

" it 's not a problem coming and going ; i went to israel once through turkey and once through cyprus and it was not problem at all , " she says .
gone are the early days of the iranian revolution when jews - and many muslims - found it hard to get passports to travel abroad .
" in the last five years the government has allowed iranian jews to go to israel freely , meet their families and when they come back they face no problems , " says mr mohtamed .
he says there is also a way for iranian jews who emigrated to israel decades ago to return to iran and see their families .

although iran and israel are bitter enemies , few know that iran is home to the largest number of jews anywhere in the middle east outside israel .
about 25,000 jews live in iran and most are determined to remain no matter what the pressures - as proud of their iranian culture as of their jewish roots .
it is dawn in the yusufabad synagogue in tehran and iranian jews bring out the torah and read the ancient text before making their way to work .
it is not a sight you would expect in a revolutionary islamic state , but there are synagogues dotted all over iran where jews discreetly practise their religion .
" because of our long history here we are tolerated , " says jewish community leader unees hammami , who organised the prayers .
he says the father of iran 's revolution , imam khomeini , recognised jews as a religious minority that should be protected .
as a result jews have one representative in the iranian parliament .
" imam khomeini made a distinction between jews and zionists and he supported us , " says mr hammami .
' anti-jewish feeling ' in the yusufabad synagogue the announcements are made in persian - most iranian jews do n't really speak hebrew well .
jews have lived in persia for nearly 3,000 years - the descendants of slaves from babylon saved by cyrus the great .
over the centuries there have been sporadic purges , pogroms and forced conversions to islam as well as periods of peaceful co-existence .
these days anti-jewish feeling is periodically stirred by the media .
whatever they say abroad is lies - we are comfortable in iran - if you 're not political and do n't bother them then they wo n't bother you hersel gabriel mr hammami says state-run television confuses zionism and judaism so that " ordinary people may think that whatever the israelis do is supported by all jews " .
during the fighting in lebanon a hardline weekly newspaper , yalesarat , published two photographs of synagogues on its front page full of people waving israeli flags celebrating israeli independence day .
the paper falsely said the synagogues were in iran - even describing one as the yusufabad synagogue in tehran and locating another in shiraz .
" this provoked a number of opportunists in shiraz , " explains iran 's jewish mp , maurice mohtamed , " and there was an assault on two synagogues . "
mr mohtamed says the incident was defused by the iranian security forces , who explained to people that the news was not true .
and with the coming to power of an ultra-conservative like president mahmoud ahmadinejad , there has been increased concern internationally about the fate of iranian jews .
' holocaust denial ' mr ahmedinejad has repeatedly used rabid anti-israeli rhetoric - slogans like " wipe israel off the map " - and most controversially he has questioned the number killed in the holocaust during world war ii .
mr mohtamed has been outspoken in his condemnation of the president 's views - in itself a sign that there is some space for jews in iran to express themselves .
president ahmedinejad has repeatedly used anti-israeli rhetoric " it 's very regrettable to see a horrible tragedy so far reaching as the holocaust being denied ... it was a very big insult to jews all around the world , " says mr mohtamed , who has also strongly condemned the exhibition of cartoons about the holocaust organised by an iranian newspaper owned by the tehran municipality .
despite the offence mahmoud ahmedinejad has caused to jews around the world , his office recently donated money for tehran 's jewish hospital .
it is one of only four jewish charity hospitals worldwide and is funded with money from the jewish diaspora - something remarkable in iran where even local aid organisations have difficulty receiving funds from abroad for fear of being accused of being foreign agents .
most of the patients and staff are muslim these days , but director ciamak morsathegh is jewish .
" anti-semitism is not an eastern phenomenon , it 's not an islamic or iranian phenomenon - anti-semitism is a european phenomenon , " he says , arguing that jews in iran even in their worst days never suffered as much as they did in europe .
israeli family ties but there are legal problems for jews in iran - if one member of a jewish family converts to islam he can inherit all the family 's property .
jews can not become army officers and the headmasters of the jewish schools in tehran are all muslim , though there is no law that says this should be so .
but their greatest vulnerability is their links to israel - where many jews have relatives .
seven years ago a group of jews in the southern city of shiraz was accused of spying for israel - eventually they were all released .
but today many iranian jews travel to and from iran 's enemy israel .
an anti-israeli ' holocaust cartoon contest ' was held in tehran in one of tehran 's six remaining kosher butcher 's shops , everyone has relatives in israel .

" it 's not a problem coming and going ; i went to israel once through turkey and once through cyprus and it was not problem at all , " she says .
gone are the early days of the iranian revolution when jews - and many muslims - found it hard to get passports to travel abroad .
" in the last five years the government has allowed iranian jews to go to israel freely , meet their families and when they come back they face no problems , " says mr mohtamed .
he says there is also a way for iranian jews who emigrated to israel decades ago to return to iran and see their families .
" they can now go to the iranian consul general in istanbul and get iranian identity documents and freely come to iran , " he says .
the exodus of jews from iran seems to have slowed down - the first wave was in the 1950s and the second was in the wake of the iranian revolution .
those jews who remain in iran seem to have made a conscious decision to stay put .

although iran and israel are bitter enemies , few know that iran is home to the largest number of jews anywhere in the middle east outside israel .
about 25,000 jews live in iran and most are determined to remain no matter what the pressures - as proud of their iranian culture as of their jewish roots .
it is dawn in the yusufabad synagogue in tehran and iranian jews bring out the torah and read the ancient text before making their way to work .
it is not a sight you would expect in a revolutionary islamic state , but there are synagogues dotted all over iran where jews discreetly practise their religion .
" because of our long history here we are tolerated , " says jewish community leader unees hammami , who organised the prayers .
he says the father of iran 's revolution , imam khomeini , recognised jews as a religious minority that should be protected .
as a result jews have one representative in the iranian parliament .
" imam khomeini made a distinction between jews and zionists and he supported us , " says mr hammami .
' anti-jewish feeling ' in the yusufabad synagogue the announcements are made in persian - most iranian jews do n't really speak hebrew well .
jews have lived in persia for nearly 3,000 years - the descendants of slaves from babylon saved by cyrus the great .
over the centuries there have been sporadic purges , pogroms and forced conversions to islam as well as periods of peaceful co-existence .
these days anti-jewish feeling is periodically stirred by the media .
whatever they say abroad is lies - we are comfortable in iran - if you 're not political and do n't bother them then they wo n't bother you hersel gabriel mr hammami says state-run television confuses zionism and judaism so that " ordinary people may think that whatever the israelis do is supported by all jews " .
during the fighting in lebanon a hardline weekly newspaper , yalesarat , published two photographs of synagogues on its front page full of people waving israeli flags celebrating israeli independence day .
the paper falsely said the synagogues were in iran - even describing one as the yusufabad synagogue in tehran and locating another in shiraz .
" this provoked a number of opportunists in shiraz , " explains iran 's jewish mp , maurice mohtamed , " and there was an assault on two synagogues . "
mr mohtamed says the incident was defused by the iranian security forces , who explained to people that the news was not true .
and with the coming to power of an ultra-conservative like president mahmoud ahmadinejad , there has been increased concern internationally about the fate of iranian jews .
' holocaust denial ' mr ahmedinejad has repeatedly used rabid anti-israeli rhetoric - slogans like " wipe israel off the map " - and most controversially he has questioned the number killed in the holocaust during world war ii .
mr mohtamed has been outspoken in his condemnation of the president 's views - in itself a sign that there is some space for jews in iran to express themselves .
president ahmedinejad has repeatedly used anti-israeli rhetoric " it 's very regrettable to see a horrible tragedy so far reaching as the holocaust being denied ... it was a very big insult to jews all around the world , " says mr mohtamed , who has also strongly condemned the exhibition of cartoons about the holocaust organised by an iranian newspaper owned by the tehran municipality .
despite the offence mahmoud ahmedinejad has caused to jews around the world , his office recently donated money for tehran 's jewish hospital .
it is one of only four jewish charity hospitals worldwide and is funded with money from the jewish diaspora - something remarkable in iran where even local aid organisations have difficulty receiving funds from abroad for fear of being accused of being foreign agents .
most of the patients and staff are muslim these days , but director ciamak morsathegh is jewish .

israeli family ties but there are legal problems for jews in iran - if one member of a jewish family converts to islam he can inherit all the family 's property .
jews can not become army officers and the headmasters of the jewish schools in tehran are all muslim , though there is no law that says this should be so .
but their greatest vulnerability is their links to israel - where many jews have relatives .
seven years ago a group of jews in the southern city of shiraz was accused of spying for israel - eventually they were all released .
but today many iranian jews travel to and from iran 's enemy israel .
an anti-israeli ' holocaust cartoon contest ' was held in tehran in one of tehran 's six remaining kosher butcher 's shops , everyone has relatives in israel .

the faw council was due to appear before the sport committee this week for their welsh football review report .
but faw secretary general david collins wrote to ams saying they would not be attending the meeting .
mr collins wants to meet the committee after the council has gathered the rest of its evidence .
opposition ams have criticised the faw 's decision .
the faw council wrote to the assembly committee following a meeting in cardiff on tuesday .
it would n't be of any benefit to football if the committee or the faw were too proud to meet owen john thomas am mr collins said the council had made the decision because much of the evidence already submitted to the committee had been " factually incorrect or totally misleading " .
" the council has decided to invite the culture , welsh language and sport committee to meet with us following its evaluation of evidence and prior to its production of its report .
" we hope then that the meeting with the faw ... gives us both the opportunity to explore how the welsh assembly can assist the development of football in wales , " he said .
" the difficulty with -lsb- a committee hearing -rsb- is you have a very short time and they just fire questions at you , so it does n't in fact elicit the tremendous amount of work that the faw has been achieving over the last number of years . "
david collins said he wanted to meet the committee at a later date mr collins added he did not want to " enter into conflict " with the assembly , but work with it .
opposition ams have criticised the faw 's decision not to attend the committee next week .
conservative sport spokeswoman laura anne jones said she was " disappointed " at the news .
" there are certainly many questions that need to be asked to the faw and it is a real shame that they have n't got the balls to come in and defend themselves and maybe tell us of any good work that is going on . "
plaid culture spokesman owen john thomas am said : " what 's important to me is not whether or not they 're -lsb- the faw -rsb- willing to come to the committee but whether they will meet us soon - for the sake of welsh football .
" it would n't be of any benefit to football if the committee or the faw were too proud to meet . "

the faw council was due to appear before the sport committee this week for their welsh football review report .
but faw secretary general david collins wrote to ams saying they would not be attending the meeting .
mr collins wants to meet the committee after the council has gathered the rest of its evidence .
opposition ams have criticised the faw 's decision .
the faw council wrote to the assembly committee following a meeting in cardiff on tuesday .
it would n't be of any benefit to football if the committee or the faw were too proud to meet owen john thomas am mr collins said the council had made the decision because much of the evidence already submitted to the committee had been " factually incorrect or totally misleading " .
" the council has decided to invite the culture , welsh language and sport committee to meet with us following its evaluation of evidence and prior to its production of its report .
" we hope then that the meeting with the faw ... gives us both the opportunity to explore how the welsh assembly can assist the development of football in wales , " he said .
" the difficulty with -lsb- a committee hearing -rsb- is you have a very short time and they just fire questions at you , so it does n't in fact elicit the tremendous amount of work that the faw has been achieving over the last number of years . "
david collins said he wanted to meet the committee at a later date mr collins added he did not want to " enter into conflict " with the assembly , but work with it .

the price cut is aimed at boosting the launch of the machine and making it more competitive with the xbox 360 .
the price for the north american and european launch will stay the same .
the surprise move will see the 20 gigabyte version of the ps3 sell for 49,980 yen -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- when it goes on sale on 11 november in japan .
no changes to the price of the higher end model - 60gb version - or european and us prices were announced .
gaming community sony has previously been criticised by the gaming community for the high cost of the new console .
the lack of an announced price cut for the us and europe markets may also raise some gamers ' ire .
in the us , the system with a 20gb hard drive will cost $ 499 , while a model with a 60gb drive will cost $ 599 .
european pricing is 499 and 599 euros respectively .
the new japanese price puts the console in the same range as the basic xbox 360 machine combined with an add-on hd-dvd player , which cost 49,600 yen together .
japanese gamers are eager to get their hands on the machine sony hopes the price cut will deflect criticism after a series of delays to the playstation 3 console , concerns about price and apathy from some gamers about the capabilities of the machine .
when the new console is released in november it will compete with microsoft 's xbox 360 and the nintendo wii .
nintendo 's new console will cost 25,000 yen or lower in japan and $ 250 -lrb- £ 133 -rrb- or less in the us , while microsoft 's xbox 360 , which went on sale last november , starts at $ 299 in the us and £ 209 in the uk .
playstation boss ken kutaragi , speaking on the opening day of the tokyo game show , also said that all 20gb consoles would come complete with an hdmi connection , important for playing high definition graphics .
previously , sony had said that only the top end 60gb model would come with the connector .
high definition he said that it had now become apparent that there was a need for the high definition capability .
mr kutaragi also took the opportunity to apologise to games developers for delays in the release of the ps3 .
vote results should the japanese ps3 price cut apply to europe and north america ?
yes 95.10 % no 4.90 % 3227 votes cast results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion the new console was originally scheduled for launch in spring 2006 , but technical hitches postponed the worldwide release until november this year .
earlier this month , sony was also forced to announce that european gamers would have to wait until 2007 to get their hands on the next generation console after delays in production .
japanese gamers will be able to buy the console from 11 november .
more than 200 of the consoles are on display at tgs .
" what is important is that we get more consoles sold to make up for the price cut and get more game makers and chip makers in our camp , " mr kutaragi said at the conference .
no further delays he said the company 's focus was now on ensuring that no further delays occur .
the announcements were made in a question and answer session following mr kutaragi 's keynote speech at the opening of tgs .
the speech , titled next generation entertainment created by the ps3 was almost devoid of any announcement about the new console .
instead , mr kutaragi took the opportunity to outline his vision for a future of networked gaming and game development .
he told the audience that game developers need to innovate and be prepared for a new generation of networked gaming in the future .
he told the games industry that advances in computer hardware and internet services could change the way games are made .
gamers ' content content generated by gamers , such as digital photos and video , could be harnessed by game makers , he said .
in addition , data such as digital maps of the real world and blueprints of new cars could be used to make more realistic and cheaper games , he said .
" you might think this is a long way off , but it is not , " he said .
" if the data is available , we can utilise it . "
the tokyo game show takes place from 22 to 24 september at makuhari messe conference centre in chiba near tokyo .

viewpoint jeffrey a mcneely biofuels could end up damaging the natural world rather than saving it from global warming , argues jeff mcneely in the green room .
better policies , better science and genetic modification , he says , can all contribute to a greener biofuels revolution . "
with soaring oil prices , and debates raging on how to reduce carbon emissions to slow climate change , many are looking to biofuels as a renewable and clean source of energy .
the european union recently has issued a directive calling for biofuels to meet 5.75 % of transportation fuel needs by 2010 .
germany and france have announced they intend to meet the target well before the deadline ; california intends going still further .
this is a classic " good news-bad news " story .
of course we all want greater energy security , and helping achieve the goals -lrb- however weak -rrb- of the kyoto protocol is surely a good thing . "
little wonder that many are calling biofuels " deforestation diesel " " send us your comments however , biofuels - made by producing ethanol , an alcohol fuel made from maize , sugar cane , or other plant matter - may be a penny wise but pound foolish way of doing so .
consider the following : the grain required to fill the petrol tank of a range rover with ethanol is sufficient to feed one person per year .
assuming the petrol tank is refilled every two weeks , the amount of grain required would feed a hungry african village for a year much of the fuel that europeans use will be imported from brazil , where the amazon is being burned to plant more sugar and soybeans , and southeast asia , where oil palm plantations are destroying the rainforest habitat of orangutans and many other species .
species are dying for our driving if ethanol is imported from the us , it will likely come from maize , which uses fossil fuels at every stage in the production process , from cultivation using fertilisers and tractors to processing and transportation .
growing maize appears to use 30 % more energy than the finished fuel produces , and leaves eroded soils and polluted waters behind meeting the 5.75 % target would require , according to one authoritative study , a quarter of the eu 's arable land using ethanol rather than petrol reduces total emissions of carbon dioxide by only about 13 % because of the pollution caused by the production process , and because ethanol gets only about 70 % of the mileage of petrol food prices are already increasing .
with just 10 % of the world 's sugar harvest being converted to ethanol , the price of sugar has doubled ; the price of palm oil has increased 15 % over the past year , with a further 25 % gain expected next year .
little wonder that many are calling biofuels " deforestation diesel " , the opposite of the environmentally friendly fuel that all are seeking .
with so much farmland already taking the form of monoculture , with all that implies for wildlife , do we really want to create more diversity-stripped desert ?
others are worried about the impacts of biofuels on food prices , which will affect especially the poor who already spend a large proportion of their income on food .
biotech boost so what is to be done ?
the first step is to increase our understanding of how nature works to produce energy .
amazingly , scientists do not yet have a full understanding of the workings of photosynthesis , the process by which plants use solar energy to absorb carbon dioxide and build carbohydrates . "
some environmentalists are worried that altered trees will cross-breed with wild trees , resulting in a drooping forest rather than one that stands tall " biotechnology , its reputation sullied by public protests over gm foods , may make important contributions .
according to the science journal nature , recombinant technology is already available that could enhance ethanol yield , reduce environmental damage from feedstock , and improve bioprocessing efficiency at the refinery .
the swiss biotech firm syngenta is developing a genetically engineered maize that can help convert itself into ethanol by growing a particular enzyme .
others are designing trees that have less lignin , the strength-giving substance that enables them to stand upright , but makes it more difficult to convert the tree 's cellulose into ethanol .
some environmentalists are worried that these altered trees will cross-breed with wild trees , resulting in a drooping forest rather than one that stands tall and produces useful timber and wildlife habitat .
in the longer run , biotech promises to help convert wood chips , farm wastes , and willow trees into bioethanol more cheaply and cleanly , thereby helping meet energy needs while also improving its public image .
public stake but that is not nearly enough ; bioenergy is too important to be left in the hands of the private sector .
many of the social and environmental benefits of bioenergy are not priced in the market , so the public sector needs to step in to ensure these benefits are delivered .
an easy immediate step would be to mandate improved fuel efficiency for all forms of transport , beginning with the private automobile .
a 20 % increase in fuel-efficiency standards is feasible using current technology , and would save far more energy than europe 's biomass could produce .
biofuels : the next generation governments also need to provide leadership in the form of economic incentives to minimise competition between food and fuel crops , and ensure that water , high-quality agricultural land , and biodiversity are not sacrificed on the altar of our convenience .
calculations of energy return on investment need to include environmental impacts on soil , water , climate change , and ecosystem services .
the bottom line is that biofuels can contribute to energy and environmental goals only as part of an overall strategy that includes energy conservation , a diversity of sustainable energy sources , greater efficiency in production and transport , and careful management of ethanol production . "

biotech boost so what is to be done ?
the first step is to increase our understanding of how nature works to produce energy .

according to the science journal nature , recombinant technology is already available that could enhance ethanol yield , reduce environmental damage from feedstock , and improve bioprocessing efficiency at the refinery .
the swiss biotech firm syngenta is developing a genetically engineered maize that can help convert itself into ethanol by growing a particular enzyme .
others are designing trees that have less lignin , the strength-giving substance that enables them to stand upright , but makes it more difficult to convert the tree 's cellulose into ethanol .
some environmentalists are worried that these altered trees will cross-breed with wild trees , resulting in a drooping forest rather than one that stands tall and produces useful timber and wildlife habitat .
in the longer run , biotech promises to help convert wood chips , farm wastes , and willow trees into bioethanol more cheaply and cleanly , thereby helping meet energy needs while also improving its public image .
public stake but that is not nearly enough ; bioenergy is too important to be left in the hands of the private sector .
many of the social and environmental benefits of bioenergy are not priced in the market , so the public sector needs to step in to ensure these benefits are delivered .
an easy immediate step would be to mandate improved fuel efficiency for all forms of transport , beginning with the private automobile .
a 20 % increase in fuel-efficiency standards is feasible using current technology , and would save far more energy than europe 's biomass could produce .
biofuels : the next generation governments also need to provide leadership in the form of economic incentives to minimise competition between food and fuel crops , and ensure that water , high-quality agricultural land , and biodiversity are not sacrificed on the altar of our convenience .
calculations of energy return on investment need to include environmental impacts on soil , water , climate change , and ecosystem services .
the bottom line is that biofuels can contribute to energy and environmental goals only as part of an overall strategy that includes energy conservation , a diversity of sustainable energy sources , greater efficiency in production and transport , and careful management of ethanol production .

viewpoint jeffrey a mcneely biofuels could end up damaging the natural world rather than saving it from global warming , argues jeff mcneely in the green room .
better policies , better science and genetic modification , he says , can all contribute to a greener biofuels revolution .
europe intends to adapt brazil 's experience with bioethanol with soaring oil prices , and debates raging on how to reduce carbon emissions to slow climate change , many are looking to biofuels as a renewable and clean source of energy .
the european union recently has issued a directive calling for biofuels to meet 5.75 % of transportation fuel needs by 2010 .
germany and france have announced they intend to meet the target well before the deadline ; california intends going still further .
this is a classic " good news-bad news " story .
of course we all want greater energy security , and helping achieve the goals -lrb- however weak -rrb- of the kyoto protocol is surely a good thing .
little wonder that many are calling biofuels " deforestation diesel " send us your comments however , biofuels - made by producing ethanol , an alcohol fuel made from maize , sugar cane , or other plant matter - may be a penny wise but pound foolish way of doing so .
consider the following : the grain required to fill the petrol tank of a range rover with ethanol is sufficient to feed one person per year .
assuming the petrol tank is refilled every two weeks , the amount of grain required would feed a hungry african village for a year much of the fuel that europeans use will be imported from brazil , where the amazon is being burned to plant more sugar and soybeans , and southeast asia , where oil palm plantations are destroying the rainforest habitat of orangutans and many other species .
species are dying for our driving the expansion of biofuels would increase monoculture farming if ethanol is imported from the us , it will likely come from maize , which uses fossil fuels at every stage in the production process , from cultivation using fertilisers and tractors to processing and transportation .
growing maize appears to use 30 % more energy than the finished fuel produces , and leaves eroded soils and polluted waters behind meeting the 5.75 % target would require , according to one authoritative study , a quarter of the eu 's arable land using ethanol rather than petrol reduces total emissions of carbon dioxide by only about 13 % because of the pollution caused by the production process , and because ethanol gets only about 70 % of the mileage of petrol food prices are already increasing .
with just 10 % of the world 's sugar harvest being converted to ethanol , the price of sugar has doubled ; the price of palm oil has increased 15 % over the past year , with a further 25 % gain expected next year .

get the returns in before the end of the month and revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- will calculate the amount of tax owed .
however , the growing number of people who file their returns electronically via the hmrc website have more time , and have a 30 december deadline .
more than nine million people have been sent income tax forms this year .
once the returns have come in , taxpayers will have until 31 january to pay the money they owe to hmrc .
if the tax owed is less than £ 2,000 then the hmrc will try to collect it automatically by changing the taxpayer 's tax code for the forthcoming tax year .
the september and december deadlines only relate to those people who want the hmrc to calculate their tax .
should a person in the self-assessment system have an accountant , or be confident in doing the maths themselves , then the final deadline for getting the forms in and paying any tax owed is at the end of january .
if taxpayers ' forms have not been submitted by then , either manually or electronically , there is an automatic fine of £ 100 .
and if it turns out that there is still tax to pay then interest and surcharges start to be levied until the outstanding sum is paid .
online filing although the system of self-assessment in now in its tenth year this is only the fourth year that hmrc has let people submit their income tax details via its official website .
hmrc said : " when you file your tax return online you get an immediate acknowledgement and , if hmrc owe you money , a faster repayment than if your return is sent on paper . "
when it first started , the web site was plagued with technical problems and in the first year only 30,000 returns were submitted this way .
but last year , with the problems largely ironed out , two million people used the site to fill in and submit their forms .
john whiting , a senior tax partner at accountants price waterhouse coopers said self assessment was now a good system .
" i think the system has got steadily better and more efficient - the website is working much better now as well , " he said .
late payers the system of self assessment is aimed largely at the self employed who are not covered by the standard paye system for collecting income tax .
but it also targets those who may have income that is not taxed at source and people such as company directors , business partners , those with income from letting property or who have complex financial affairs , such as income from abroad .
last year only about half the people who were sent self assessment forms returned them by the september deadline .
more worryingly , about one million then failed to return forms - paper or electronic - by the end of january , thus incurring fines and penalties .
as well as receiving a fine for not getting a form in on time , if anyone fails to pay the required tax by 1 february then interest will start to be levied on the unpaid sum .
and if the tax is still unpaid a month later , by the end of february , a further 5 % fine will be imposed .

get the returns in before the end of the month and revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- will calculate the amount of tax owed .
however , the growing number of people who file their returns electronically via the hmrc website have more time , and have a 30 december deadline .
more than nine million people have been sent income tax forms this year .
once the returns have come in , taxpayers will have until 31 january to pay the money they owe to hmrc .
if the tax owed is less than £ 2,000 then the hmrc will try to collect it automatically by changing the taxpayer 's tax code for the forthcoming tax year .
the september and december deadlines only relate to those people who want the hmrc to calculate their tax .
should a person in the self-assessment system have an accountant , or be confident in doing the maths themselves , then the final deadline for getting the forms in and paying any tax owed is at the end of january .
if taxpayers ' forms have not been submitted by then , either manually or electronically , there is an automatic fine of £ 100 .
and if it turns out that there is still tax to pay then interest and surcharges start to be levied until the outstanding sum is paid .
online filing although the system of self-assessment in now in its tenth year this is only the fourth year that hmrc has let people submit their income tax details via its official website .
hmrc said : " when you file your tax return online you get an immediate acknowledgement and , if hmrc owe you money , a faster repayment than if your return is sent on paper . "
when it first started , the web site was plagued with technical problems and in the first year only 30,000 returns were submitted this way .
but last year , with the problems largely ironed out , two million people used the site to fill in and submit their forms .
john whiting , a senior tax partner at accountants price waterhouse coopers said self assessment was now a good system .
" i think the system has got steadily better and more efficient - the website is working much better now as well , " he said .
late payers the system of self assessment is aimed largely at the self employed who are not covered by the standard paye system for collecting income tax .
but it also targets those who may have income that is not taxed at source and people such as company directors , business partners , those with income from letting property or who have complex financial affairs , such as income from abroad .
last year only about half the people who were sent self assessment forms returned them by the september deadline .
more worryingly , about one million then failed to return forms - paper or electronic - by the end of january , thus incurring fines and penalties .
as well as receiving a fine for not getting a form in on time , if anyone fails to pay the required tax by 1 february then interest will start to be levied on the unpaid sum .
and if the tax is still unpaid a month later , by the end of february , a further 5 % fine will be imposed .

what is going on in the world ?
i work with a lot of muslims and they are as bemused as me .
why ca n't we speak openly and honestly on the issue of terrorism ?
aubrey sutton , bolton text : religion is not worth all the trouble it causes .

nick palmer , leicester text : we believe in free speech in this country - but it works both ways .
gill , sandwich muslims have an obligation as muslims to believe in and understand one faith , one way of life .
to expect muslims to integrate into a " western " way of life that is considered un-islamic is wrong , it will never happen .
ian sutheran , birmingham let 's stand back a moment and smell the coffee .
so all things being equal , if the pope had mentioned any other group of people , would they have protested around the world ?
leroy , london text : are we to assume all muslims are anti-christian ?

you said : text : should n't the home secretary warn parents not to let their children become racists ?
philip , glasgow harriet harman should not be defending the indefensible .

tim morrow , glasgow text : reid was playing politics .

you said : text : charlie k will be back in charge before the next election .

steve fuller , hove , east sussex text : charles is a dish - bring him back !
waz , notts i find charles kennedy to be thoroughly engaging and was very disappointed in his party 's treatment of him after being honest and owning up to his failings .
he is by far the most charismatic and apparently real of all the politicians in the public eye at present and the liberal democrats would be wise to seriously reconsider reappointing him as their leader .
ian walter , portsmouth text : ming is too much of a gent to be a politician .
nick , yorks i just wanted to let charles kennedy know that as an snp supporter since i was able to vote and many years before , the only reason i would consider voting lib dem would be completely down to him .
