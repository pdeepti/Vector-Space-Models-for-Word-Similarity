thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .

he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2006 identifying the roots of immigrant crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inner city life leaves kids alienated and angry in berlin , young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their german peers .
it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .
his priorities would still remain america first , europe second .
the question would be how far would he go to follow the united states ?
berlusconi could face internal unrest from possible coalition partners if he strays too far from europe and the italian public , with its deep-rooted belief in european integration , could also cause problems . italians will not only be choosing their own direction in the coming days but possibly the immediate future of their country in the international arena . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .
his priorities would still remain america first , europe second .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .

i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

" it was the coaching team 's decision , " said hildebrand , who is likely to be involved in germany 's next goalkeeper duel .
" it does n't change anything in my situation . " but many of germany 's other players are interested in seeing how the situation , which the german media have clung to since rudi völler 's side was eliminated from the 2004 european championship , turns out and how kahn 's career will continue . what will become of kahn ?

former germany team mate fredi bobic also said his time on the national team has given him a feeling of how kahn will react . " i ca n't imagine oliver kahn as the number two during a world cup , " he said .
" i think he will resign . " others observers are explicitly recommending " king kahn " pack away his gloves for good . " if i were in kahn 's place i would immediately resign from the national team , " former germany goalkeeper uli stein told the stuttgart zeitung on saturday .
" the question is whether kahn is man enough to accept the decision .
can he can even live with it ? " no word from kahn on future " immeasurably disappointed , " kahn himself said he intends to take some time to evaluate his options with the national team and concentrate on his duties at bayern munich , who seem to have the german title all but in the trophy case . but the most sympathetic ear might come from lehmann , the one person no expects kahn to call on for a heart-to-heart . " i can completely understand how sad he must be , " the new no.1 told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .

the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .

russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .

in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .

european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .

the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2006 eu tells china not to step on its toes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to know where those shoes came from the eu has again taken up the import fight against china by placing a tariff on leather shoes .
the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .

this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 " the protection of human rights is endangered " back to first page back 2/2 which countries have particular deficits ?
my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .

the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

for jürgen klinsmann picking jens lehmann as the starting goalie was the hardest choice of his time at coach of the national team .
german players are just happy a decision has been made . obviously pleased to get off the bench after watching oliver kahn shout at the defense for the last three major international championships , lehmann said he is going to " work even harder " to validate klinsmann 's decision . the german trainer said he and his coaching team analyzed the last 22 months of each player 's development before making the decision german soccer fans have been waiting at least as long to hear . early decision a long time coming " i 'm happy that a decision has been made , " germany 's per mertesacker said , summing up most of the public 's opinion as well .
" it 's been long overdue .
now those involved know where they stand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand 's may move up a spot on the germany bench other players , including stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , are n't taking too much time to analyze the ins and outs of klinsmann 's decision , one the coach reached weeks ahead of the fifa deadline . " it was the coaching team 's decision , " said hildebrand , who is likely to be involved in germany 's next goalkeeper duel .
" it does n't change anything in my situation . " but many of germany 's other players are interested in seeing how the situation , which the german media have clung to since rudi völler 's side was eliminated from the 2004 european championship , turns out and how kahn 's career will continue . what will become of kahn ? " someone always has to be the loser , " hanover striker and german international thomas brdaric said .
" i 'm interested in seeing how oliver kahn reacts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can this man be happy in the second spot ?
former germany team mate fredi bobic also said his time on the national team has given him a feeling of how kahn will react . " i ca n't imagine oliver kahn as the number two during a world cup , " he said .
" i think he will resign . " others observers are explicitly recommending " king kahn " pack away his gloves for good . " if i were in kahn 's place i would immediately resign from the national team , " former germany goalkeeper uli stein told the stuttgart zeitung on saturday .
" the question is whether kahn is man enough to accept the decision .
can he can even live with it ? " no word from kahn on future " immeasurably disappointed , " kahn himself said he intends to take some time to evaluate his options with the national team and concentrate on his duties at bayern munich , who seem to have the german title all but in the trophy case . but the most sympathetic ear might come from lehmann , the one person no expects kahn to call on for a heart-to-heart . " i can completely understand how sad he must be , " the new no.1 told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung .
" i experienced a similar situation for two world cups and two european championships .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .

meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .

in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .

there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .

russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .

i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .

but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2006 identifying the roots of immigrant crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inner city life leaves kids alienated and angry in berlin , young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their german peers .
it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .
his priorities would still remain america first , europe second .
the question would be how far would he go to follow the united states ?
berlusconi could face internal unrest from possible coalition partners if he strays too far from europe and the italian public , with its deep-rooted belief in european integration , could also cause problems . italians will not only be choosing their own direction in the coming days but possibly the immediate future of their country in the international arena . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .

the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.04.2006 opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann : the better choice for the german team germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : italy takes to the polls italian election campaigns turn cut-throat out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?
italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .

the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .
the first pairs of mass-produced cleats - thick , heavy , ankle-high boots often outfitted with six cleats - were designed for students in middle of the 19th century . it was n't until new materials were developed that comfort and weight could be factored in to what players wrapped around their feet .
germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.04.2006 opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann : the better choice for the german team germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.04.2006 opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann : the better choice for the german team germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .

the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .

there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?

for jürgen klinsmann picking jens lehmann as the starting goalie was the hardest choice of his time at coach of the national team .
german players are just happy a decision has been made . obviously pleased to get off the bench after watching oliver kahn shout at the defense for the last three major international championships , lehmann said he is going to " work even harder " to validate klinsmann 's decision . the german trainer said he and his coaching team analyzed the last 22 months of each player 's development before making the decision german soccer fans have been waiting at least as long to hear . early decision a long time coming " i 'm happy that a decision has been made , " germany 's per mertesacker said , summing up most of the public 's opinion as well .
" it 's been long overdue .
now those involved know where they stand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timo hildebrand 's may move up a spot on the germany bench other players , including stuttgart goalkeeper timo hildebrand , are n't taking too much time to analyze the ins and outs of klinsmann 's decision , one the coach reached weeks ahead of the fifa deadline . " it was the coaching team 's decision , " said hildebrand , who is likely to be involved in germany 's next goalkeeper duel .
" it does n't change anything in my situation . " but many of germany 's other players are interested in seeing how the situation , which the german media have clung to since rudi völler 's side was eliminated from the 2004 european championship , turns out and how kahn 's career will continue . what will become of kahn ? " someone always has to be the loser , " hanover striker and german international thomas brdaric said .
" i 'm interested in seeing how oliver kahn reacts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can this man be happy in the second spot ?
former germany team mate fredi bobic also said his time on the national team has given him a feeling of how kahn will react . " i ca n't imagine oliver kahn as the number two during a world cup , " he said .
" i think he will resign . " others observers are explicitly recommending " king kahn " pack away his gloves for good . " if i were in kahn 's place i would immediately resign from the national team , " former germany goalkeeper uli stein told the stuttgart zeitung on saturday .
" the question is whether kahn is man enough to accept the decision .
can he can even live with it ? " no word from kahn on future " immeasurably disappointed , " kahn himself said he intends to take some time to evaluate his options with the national team and concentrate on his duties at bayern munich , who seem to have the german title all but in the trophy case . but the most sympathetic ear might come from lehmann , the one person no expects kahn to call on for a heart-to-heart .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .

what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .
-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .
the first pairs of mass-produced cleats - thick , heavy , ankle-high boots often outfitted with six cleats - were designed for students in middle of the 19th century . it was n't until new materials were developed that comfort and weight could be factored in to what players wrapped around their feet .
germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.04.2006 opinion : klinsmann 's psychological choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann : the better choice for the german team germany coach jürgen klinsmann has let the cat out of the bag and picked jens lehmann to be the side 's starting goalkeeper .
a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .
german coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to demote bayern munich 's oliver kahn to the role of deputy .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure .

" access to criminal groups is a key factor .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .
the first pairs of mass-produced cleats - thick , heavy , ankle-high boots often outfitted with six cleats - were designed for students in middle of the 19th century . it was n't until new materials were developed that comfort and weight could be factored in to what players wrapped around their feet .
germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .
the first pairs of mass-produced cleats - thick , heavy , ankle-high boots often outfitted with six cleats - were designed for students in middle of the 19th century . it was n't until new materials were developed that comfort and weight could be factored in to what players wrapped around their feet .
germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .

what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .

thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .

subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .

he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 " the protection of human rights is endangered " back to first page back 2/2 which countries have particular deficits ?
my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 " the protection of human rights is endangered " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg will not leave a stone unturned when it comes to human rights in europe thomas hammarberg has taken over as the council of europe 's chief human rights envoy .
in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2006 identifying the roots of immigrant crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inner city life leaves kids alienated and angry in berlin , young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their german peers .
it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .
thomas hammarberg of sweden took over this week as the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights in strasbourg .
he succeeds the spaniard alvaro gil-robles , who was the first to hold this position .
the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly appointed the 64-year-old hammarberg in october 2005 for the six-year term .
the swedish diplomat and human rights activist was , among other things , general secretary of amnesty international and head of the olof palme center in stockholm . irène bluche interviewed thomas hammarberg -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " human rights is a soccer issue " amidst all the talk and planning for the upcoming world cup , a german human rights group says its central issue must also be addressed .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .
the first pairs of mass-produced cleats - thick , heavy , ankle-high boots often outfitted with six cleats - were designed for students in middle of the 19th century . it was n't until new materials were developed that comfort and weight could be factored in to what players wrapped around their feet .
germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .

i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .

germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2006 eu tells china not to step on its toes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to know where those shoes came from the eu has again taken up the import fight against china by placing a tariff on leather shoes .
the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

the first ever world cup between japan 's kemari experts and chinese ts ’ uh-küh masters is said to have taken place in 50 b.c. the ancient greeks put a more martial slant on the game , which some say is still visible in some slide tackles , in their sport epskyros , or " ball battle . "
living practically next door , the romans adapted the game for their legionnaires who took the rugby-like game on the conquests as far as the british isles , which are seen as the home of the modern sport millions will focus their attention on this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from feather and hair to artificial intelligence ?
what happened to the ball ? air-filled balls , as documented in a 1519 english school book , seemed to be the norm for the isles ' soccer players , and was apparently already so well-spread that not even william shakespeare could let the sport pass unnoticed .
one of the much-abused characters in his comedy of errors complains that if he must be kicked around like a soccer ball , he should at least like to be sewn in leather . great britain 's patent gb 1886-4359a improved the " modern " ball in 1886 by making it out of rubber , then in 1886 and 1887 patenting the valve and air pump .
but it 's the germans who should be credited for the pattern of black and white hexagons and pentagons that is kicked around the world 's soccer yards - it 's a teutonic invention of 1970 . anyone who has ever kicked the ball over the neighbor 's hedges should also send their thanks to 2006 world cup hosts .
in 2003 , it was a german who came up with the idea of implanting a radio transmitter to determine the balls exact position in de 103 38 620 a1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the best whistle ca n't match a well-timed foul " put your whistle away and get some glasses ! " originally intended for police use , the whistle was invented by great britain 's john hudson , who was responsible for designing many of the whistles used by both police and referees , who suddenly got a lot more attention than when they just waved around white hankies to call a foul .
the debate as to whether this actually improved the game is still raging . reconstructing the path back from today 's goal to its original creator proved a difficult task for munich 's patent office employees , who , even after putting in long weekend hours - bayern munich had after all wrapped up the german title about two weeks into the season - could not determine where soccer 's first strikers were aiming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a touch of mackerel on the top makes all the difference gotta be the fish cartridge while today 's stars wedge their feet into cleats depending on their sponsoring contracts , it was hard to find any teams in the 19th century with 11 pair of the same shoes .
the first pairs of mass-produced cleats - thick , heavy , ankle-high boots often outfitted with six cleats - were designed for students in middle of the 19th century . it was n't until new materials were developed that comfort and weight could be factored in to what players wrapped around their feet .
germany 's de 1998 909 u played a special role changing how contact is made with the ball - the patent called for fish cartridge on the top of the shoe to give players more control . the report did not state whether it was the fish guts that directed more balls toward the goal or the smell that kept the defenders away . carlos aluquerque -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news and features from dw-world.de world cup is every coach 's dream paraguay has the talent to shake up the 2006 world cup favorites ' expectations and make sure the tournament stays exciting , national team coach anibal ruiz told dw-world.de.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2006 identifying the roots of immigrant crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inner city life leaves kids alienated and angry in berlin , young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their german peers .
it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2006 identifying the roots of immigrant crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inner city life leaves kids alienated and angry in berlin , young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their german peers .
it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 " the protection of human rights is endangered " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg will not leave a stone unturned when it comes to human rights in europe thomas hammarberg has taken over as the council of europe 's chief human rights envoy .
in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

" despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?

thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right or left ?
the us or europe ?
the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2006 eu tells china not to step on its toes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to know where those shoes came from the eu has again taken up the import fight against china by placing a tariff on leather shoes .
the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .
his priorities would still remain america first , europe second .
the question would be how far would he go to follow the united states ?
berlusconi could face internal unrest from possible coalition partners if he strays too far from europe and the italian public , with its deep-rooted belief in european integration , could also cause problems . italians will not only be choosing their own direction in the coming days but possibly the immediate future of their country in the international arena . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .
his priorities would still remain america first , europe second .
the question would be how far would he go to follow the united states ?
berlusconi could face internal unrest from possible coalition partners if he strays too far from europe and the italian public , with its deep-rooted belief in european integration , could also cause problems . italians will not only be choosing their own direction in the coming days but possibly the immediate future of their country in the international arena . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .
despite his lack of flamboyance , romano prodi is giving silvio berlusconi a run for his money in the fight to be italy 's next prime minister .
-lrb- april 7 , 2006 -rrb- the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- italian election campaigns turn cut-throat italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2006 identifying the roots of immigrant crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inner city life leaves kids alienated and angry in berlin , young male immigrants are three times more likely to commit violent crimes than their german peers .
it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent . no employment prospects , out-of-work parents , domestic violence … .the standard excuses for juvenile delinquency among immigrants seem credible enough , but do n't explain why it 's a rare problem in the western german city of duisburg , where the immigrant population is just as large as it is berlin . according to hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law in freiburg , this is because one over-riding factor in youth crime is peer group pressure . " as a rule , criminal or violent careers usually begin at an age when jobs and the job market do n't yet play a role , which is between 14 and 17 . " he pointed out .
" access to criminal groups is a key factor .
if a young person grows up in an area where there are lots of criminal gangs ready to welcome him into the fold , then the risk that he gravitates towards crime is significantly greater than it would be in other areas .
in this respect , ethnic considerations play no role at all . " albrecht 's conclusion is that teenagers turn to crime not because they lack prospects , but quite the reverse : that young immigrants lack prospects because they 've embraced crime . government efforts it 's a minority opinion that has never been thoroughly researched .
but in fact , few studies on the roots of violence and crime among young immigrants exist at all .
germany , france , britain and the netherlands are countries that have all experienced juvenile delinquency within their immigrant communities , but share no best-practice strategies when it comes to tackling the problem - largely due to a complete lack of research into its origins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , cars and buildings were torched by youths in many of france 's immigrant areas when violence erupted on the streets of france 's suburbs earlier this year , germany debated the possibility of similar scenes occurring in its own cities .
they already have in the netherlands , where the source of the unrest was similarly traced back to young immigrants . in the last couple of years , resentment in this famously tolerant country has been simmering away among its young muslims .
meanwhile , the dutch government feels it 's pulling out all stops in its attempts to better integrate its young immigrants into society . " in the netherlands we believe in individual supervision , " said rob witte from the institute for multi-cultural development in utrecht .
" we have professional people assigned to supervise teenagers who have fallen foul of the law .
they accompany them to the authorities , and the point is to give them consistent advice rather than conflicting information from different sources . " tackling the symptoms , not the roots britain , in contrast , can only dream of that kind of social support . " there are a lot of heroic people doing very interesting and innovative things to prevent people from drifting into crime here , " said simon hailsworth from the london metropolitan university . but it 's all to no avail when the blair government prefers to tackle the symptoms of the problem rather than roots .
" the trouble is that the kind of heroic and innovative things they 're doing receive very little funding .
i live in society where significant resources are expended on law enforcement instead , " pointed out hailsworth . no light at the end of the tunnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence at one berlin highschool was so extreme police were called in however , prevention is all very well if young criminals can be persuaded that staying on the straight and narrow is worth it .
unfortunately , telling teenage immigrants they 'd be better off in a job training scheme than holding up a kiosk is pointless when they know full well they 'll never get a place on it . but what are the options ? " it 's time we asked ourselves as a society how to stop isolating young people with poor academic results , and how to offer them the social recognition and financial means necessary to lead a contented life that 's free of violence , " said berlin social worker elvira berndt . panagiotis kouparanis -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .

in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights . dw-world : what are your plans for your term as commissioner for human rights ?
thomas hammarberg : one emphasis will be on defending human rights in times of terrorism .
the protection of human rights is very endangered when governments take action against terrorism .
there 's also a lot to do , for example , to safeguard comprehensive human rights for people with disabilities .
a further urgent issue is the treatment of roma in some european countries .
what are you going to do differently than your predecessor alvaro gil-robles ?
he did outstanding work and it is essential that i carry on what he began .
he visited 35 of the 46 member states in the council of europe and put together expert reports .
i will go to the outstanding countries - germany is one of them - and report on the human rights situation there .
subsequently , i will call on those countries my predecessor visited and report on the extent to which they have followed our recommendations .
does a commissioner for human rights even have power ?
he has a certain power when he primarily communicates with non-governmental organizations and the ombudsman or the human rights commissioner on the national level in every country .
the third point of contact is , of course , the media .
these three play a significant role together .
it is my intention to work more closely with them and to support their work .
the commissioner for human rights can thus be more than just a symbolic figure in strasbourg .
what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

what do you consider the biggest problems for your task ?
i think it 's currently xenophobia in europe .
people seem to be afraid of foreigners and suspicious of minorities .
this is a warning signal .
i hope that i can show with my work that these sentiments are not justified .
it 's important that all people in all societies have full human rights .
this way , no divides can develop in a society , which make some people feel excluded and maybe even develop animosity towards the country in which they live .
what has been achieved through the position of the commissioner for human rights ?
above all , recognition within governments that human rights are an important topic now exists - that they have to be put on the political agenda and can no longer be ignored .
if we can show that there are problems and refer to solid and independently researched facts , then we automatically have a basis for discussion with governments .
my predecessor led a direct dialogue with most european governments , so that he could directly relay his recommendations to the right powers .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

my approach is that all countries have human rights problems .
these have to be identified in every country and improvements strived for .
there will never be a situation where a nation does n't have any problems anymore .
i am rather skeptical towards governments , which smugly say that there are no human rights abuses in their country .
one of my goals is therefore to control the situation in all 46 council of europe member states without exception .
of course , i am aware that the problems in some countries are significantly more severe than in other parts of europe .
this can be a result , for example , of a country 's economic situation or a previous war .
what significance does russia have in the council of europe ?
russia is the largest country in the council of europe with the highest population .
it is just celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its membership .
russia will , by the way , be chairing the council of europe in the next term and is therefore a significant country within the council .
of course , controlling human rights in this large country is problematic .
it 's absolutely necessary for the commission of human rights to follow very closely what happens there and , of course , also express recommendations for improvement .
this is one of my priorities .
your predecessor was very involved with the situation in chechnya .
how do you want to proceed in this conflict ?
i will also intensely concern myself with chechnya .
i hope to be able to travel there .
i have visited the country in the past , so that i have a certain feeling for the situation there .
i want to put chechnya very high up on my agenda .
will you be dealing with the question of intelligence services ' authority in countries of the council of europe ?
i am concerned that there is confidential contact between intelligence services , including the us secret service , which is used in a manner harming human rights .
in europe , people are being kidnapped and either taken to guantanamo by us intelligence or to countries like egypt or secret locations .
these people have the right to fair treatment , which they 're being denied .
i am in favor of the council of europe looking into this .
what would you like to have achieved at the end of your six-year term ?
i hope that belarus is a member of the council of europe by then .
it is n't today , since it 's undemocratic .
but i think that there will even be reforms in that country , which theoretically belongs to europe .
i hope that the step backwards in human rights , which we 've experienced since the terror attacks on september 11 , 2001 will cease - and that the previously determined human rights standards will once again be confirmed and enforced in reality .
i also hope that there will be significantly more respect towards the rights of minorities in europe and foreigners that come from other parts of the world .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .

the italian election is much more than a personality contest berlusconi or prodi ?
this is the question facing italian voters in the next days .
but what effect will the result of the election have beyond italy 's borders ?
what can europe and the wider international community expect ? whoever wins the italian parliamentary election on april 9-10 - incumbent center-right prime minister silvio berlusconi or his bitter center-left rival and former eu commission president romano prodi - italy can expect an uncertain future . if berlusconi is given five more years of power , experts believe that he will continue to undermine democracy by creating laws which suit his own interests in areas such as the media and the judicial system . on the other hand if prodi becomes prime minister italy could be getting a potential time-bomb government , a mish-mash of leftists who only joined together behind their one common desire : the removal of berlusconi from power .
after achieving that , it is possible the fractious coalition would collapse in an implosion of self-interest . but what of the wider effects ?
for the european union , victory for berlusconi 's coalition would mean it would face five more years of dealing with an italian prime minister who many perceive as divisive and obtrusive .
while it is important to acknowledge differences of opinion within eu institutions and across the elites of eu member states , the overall consensus is that berlusconi has been more problematic than not . his numerous critics in the eu believe berlusconi is nothing more than a businessman who has dragged italy 's economic growth rate to the lowest in europe , lined his pockets at the country 's expense , embroiled the government in corruption scandals and has continually said the wrong things at the wrong time . berlusconi 's iraq support an open wound he has angered more inclusive eu quarters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and the memory of his cold-shouldering of europe in favour of italy 's relationship with the united states over iraq , which so angered eu allies france and germany , is still fresh .
his continued pro-us stance , coupled with the emergence of an increasingly vocal euro-skepticism within his own ruling coalition , has widely been blamed for weakening italy 's role within the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to be heard but not to listen under berlusconi , italy has become the thorn in the side of a number of european projects including the european arrest warrant - which is still not in operation in italy - and the stability and growth pact which italy continues to break with public debt currently standing at around 120 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and its budget deficit at four percent . from the eu 's point of view , there have been very few positives to come from the last five years of berlusconi rule .
the main plus point would be the political stability italy has enjoyed since his election success in 2001 .
berlusconi is the first post-war italian prime minister to serve a full legislative period , although whether his critics at the eu would see this as a positive is debatable . read on : romano prodi , europe and the transatlantic relationship 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 08.04.2006 italian elections : the foreign policy question back to first page back 2/2 although it would never publicly declare any preferred allegiance , there is little doubt that the eu would favour romano prodi as italian leader . while berlusconi has worked hard to cement a stronger transatlantic relationship at the expense of closer european ties , prodi has made it clear that a new center-left government would prioritise europe and the mediterranean region .
" only the resumption of a european policy can give us a voice in the world , " he said recently . berlusconi makes no secret of the fact that he is no fan of the eu and considers brussels a ball and chain which prevents him from acting as freely as he would like to .
prodi on the other hand has a more eurocentric vision and an in-depth knowledge of the eu from his five years as commission president .
as italian prime minister from 1996-1998 , he also made italy 's joining of the single european currency a primary goal and won passage of budgets that significantly reduced the government deficit . a prodi a eurocentric with a strong european conviction dr. damian grasmück from the center for european integration studies in bonn believes that a prodi government would ease the tensions between italy and the eu .
" prodi would be much more accepted , " he told dw-world.de.
" under prodi , and previous governments , italy was known for being a strong supporter of the european integration process .
that changed under berlusconi .
prodi 's strong european conviction is without question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi guided italy towards the single currency marco incenti from the centre for european policy studies in brussels is not so convinced .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a prodi government would be better for the eu .
there is no single italian government that can steer things in one or the other direction at the european level .
what can be said is that a prodi government would be more ' organic ' to the eu system , and prodi would probably be better for italy in europe . " despite his european credentials prodi is seen by some critics as the economics professor without a political party who failed to save his government from collapsing in 1998 and who has also been investigated for corruption .
even as his latest coalition enters the final stretch of the campaign in front by a nose , some doubt whether his shaky collection of leftists would stay together long enough to form a government . if the center-left coalition does come to power and remains intact , would that mean a reversal of berlusconi 's policy of aligning italy closer to the united states ?
prodi has said that , if elected , his government 's relations with the united states would be " good and honest " despite differences on iraq and that italy and europe needed close ties with washington . us favors berlusconi while prodi may strain ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has been useful for the us in europe " one would expect dialogue to be more strained if prodi were prime minister , " said charles kupchan , the director of european studies at the council of foreign affairs , a washington think-tank .
" but prodi will want relations to be smooth .
having good ties with the us carries weight , as berlusconi found .
and prodi wo n't have to make the unpopular decision of bringing italian troops home from iraq .
berlusconi has spared him that . " " the bush administration would prefer for berlusconi to stay in power as he has done much to push europe in a more atlanticist direction , " kupchan added .
" if he stays in power , there is unlikely to be any major changes .
berlusconi can hardly push italy any closer to us than he already has . " dr. carol mershon , an associate professor in italian politics at the university of virginia , agrees .
" since the establishment of the italian republic , italian relations with the us have maintained the same basic profile : italy is a loyal ally of the us .
no dramatic changes in this basic profile are likely whether prodi again becomes prime minister or berlusconi remains as prime minister . " little change in ' special relationship ' expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi wants good ties but iraq will cloud relations given a further five years then , berlusconi would be unlikely to change his foreign policy .
his priorities would still remain america first , europe second .
the question would be how far would he go to follow the united states ?
berlusconi could face internal unrest from possible coalition partners if he strays too far from europe and the italian public , with its deep-rooted belief in european integration , could also cause problems . italians will not only be choosing their own direction in the coming days but possibly the immediate future of their country in the international arena . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's " professore " ready to assume prime minister 's seat italians call him " the professor " due to his level-headedness and knowledge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2006 eu tells china not to step on its toes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to know where those shoes came from the eu has again taken up the import fight against china by placing a tariff on leather shoes .
the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2006 eu tells china not to step on its toes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to know where those shoes came from the eu has again taken up the import fight against china by placing a tariff on leather shoes .
the surcharge , to be phased in gradually , has not found favor in china , but europeans are also unhappy . 1.2 billion pairs of shoes .
that is the number of pieces of footwear that china annually imports to europe .
they are predominantly low-end models , providing an option for consumers with little spending power .
in germany , for example , chinese shoes make up 49 percent of imports on the market .
brussels has had its eyes on shoe imports from china and other low-cost places of production in asia , and has taken action on behalf of european shoe manufacturers to throttle the increasing dominance of the competition from the far east .
over the course of the next five months , tariffs will be raised to 19.4 percent on chinese leather shoes .
vietnam will also be subjected to tariffs .
" it is important that we act against unfair trade while encouraging legitimate and competitive trade from emerging economies , " said eu trade commissioner peter mandelson in march .
" we do not target china and vietnam ’ s natural competitive advantages , only unfair distortions of trade . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson asked for , and received , tariffs on chinese shoes the eu believes that the two countries provide low-cost loans , partial tax exemptions and below-market rents to shoe manufacturers , which in turn leads to dumping abroad .
this has harmed european competitors , said mandelson .
european shoe industry displeased the reactions to the new tariffs from the european shoe industry have hardly been ones of enthusiasm .
mandelson has asked shoe retailers not to pass on the surcharges to the consumers , having said that the shoe margins in europe are high enough as is .
it is quite clear to german shoe retailers that this will not be possible .
" the ones who will be footing the bill for this bit of regulatory madness from brussels are the consumers .
the tariffs will cause shoe prices to rise , " said winfried toubartz ’ , head of the association of german shoe retailers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers may face higher shoe prices in the future the shoe manufacturers of europe , who it might be thought would be celebrating the small victory , are also up in arms .
the european confederation of the footwear industry -lrb- cec -rrb- said in a press release that although the measures were correct in principle , they were unsatisfactory .
the reasons varied from insufficient tariffs to the failure to penalize athletic shoes .
when approached this week to answer more questions about the tariffs , the cec ’ s senior advisor jean-luc tanghe was reluctant to answer .
when asked just what the eu measure meant for the european shoe industry , he responded that the confederation was not satisfied " since the burden of tricks , copies and lies -lrb- of the chinese -rrb- are a plague for european cartesian minds . "
china not to take this fight lying down the european shoemakers may be worried about pirated footwear from china and vietnam , but the competition in china is determined not to accept mandelson ’ s decision .
the shoe industry provides work for some four million people in china .
one of the largest chinese companies alone has 200,000 employees putting shoes together , primarily for foreign markets .
150 private chinese shoe manufacturers have banded together to contest the eu tariff , and are going before the european court of justice in luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoe production : labor-intensive but a huge industry in china " most of the pressure against us is coming from italy , spain and portugal , but the european companies will suffer under these tariffs .
after all , we use italian machines , " yu shengxian , the lawyer representing the 150 chinese companies , told deutsche welle .
the shoe industry has been a boon to china .
the profit margins are biggest in the eu , hence , more jobs are being created especially to cater to that market .
" we are building a plant bigger than the main just to make shoes for europe .
but the tariffs , they could ruin our plans .
we currently have 3,000 employees .
the new plant will employ 4,000 , " liao haijun , marketing director of shoe manufacturer fuguinao , told deutsche welle .
the booming economy of china is boosted by such business .
china ’ s profits are coming at the cost of europe , however , according to trade commissioner mandelson .
it is hard to believe that either side will sacrifice jobs , either protecting or creating more of them , just to reach a compromise .
the association of 150 chinese shoemakers has suggested that if no proper agreement is achieved , then they will go to the world trade organization with their case . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

a decision as bold as it is correct and foreseeable , according to dw-world.de 's oliver samson . klinsmann 's decision put lehmann between the posts in the no. 1 jersey during this summer 's world cup is another chance for the national team coach to show his nerve since the pro-lehmann stance is naturally also an anti-kahn decision . it will take a lot of self-confidence to weather the public storm brewing around the verdict against the " titian " of german soccer and hero of the last world cups , not to mention the booing bound to come from kahn 's lobby of bayern munich , german soccer kaiser franz beckenbauer and the mass-market bild tabloid .
in fact , it 's difficult to imagine another way the national team coach could make as many enemies in one press conference . klinsmann , however , has never been worried about facing tough adversaries as he continues marching down the road of renewal he paved with the german team , taking no notice of whose toes he may step on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann seldom get this close in practice two equally skilled competitors now klinsmann 's revival has worked its way back to the best-manned position in the german team .
it hardly makes sense to judge friday 's decision on purely athletic grounds .
kahn and lehmann are , without a doubt , world-class goalkeepers , and not even soccer 's most qualified experts would be able to distinguish a tangible difference in their overall skills . but klinsmann 's decision was n't based on the how , when and why each of them comes out of the goal to grab the ball .
the coach has explicitly implanted a psychological aspect to his team and when it comes to the psychological side , lehmann is bounds beyond kahn . the arsenal keeper is at arguably the apex of his career .
standing behind a young side in london , which a few months ago even team coach arsene wenger said was being " laughed out " of matches , lehmann has helped carry his team mates triumphantly to the champions league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after two cups on the bench , can lehmann believe he 'll actually be the starter ?
timing right for psychological choice from laughing-stock to international hero : exactly the path klinsmann would like to see the germany side take while hosting the 2006 world cup - with lehmann standing behind the team .
no one will ever be able to prove he 's the better goalkeeper - not even after the tournament - but there is no question lehmann is the goalie who fits best in germany 's klinsmann era . the decision to announce his choice weeks before the fifa deadline hints toward the notion that klinsmann has long-favored lehmann .
now , while lehmann 's star is still shining bright , it 's just the right time for klinsmann to sell the pro-lehmann call to the german public , instead of waiting few more matches that could lead to the blunder that shakes up the team 's psychological state . oliver samson -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : jens lehmann named german number one for world cup germany 's number one goalkeeper at the 2006 world cup will be arsenal stopper jens lehmann , it was revealed friday .

" my son has hardly seen me , i have told him i ca n't be his dad , but i can be his friend , " says ' paul ' , an inmate at hmp chelmsford .
there are murmurs of understanding among the group of prisoners taking part in a fathers ' course at the jail .
some hope they will soon be back with their partners and children , others are pleased they still come to visit .
many know they have let their family down .
every year an estimated 150,000 schoolchildren will experience having a parent in jail .
nearly one-third of the children will experience significant mental health problems - well above average .
lengthy trips to see their parent in prison and life in a cash-strapped home are standard .
' doing the best ' some members of the prison group have not told their children about where they are , opting to pretend they are away for work reasons .
" i went through a time of imprisonment where i thought i was doing the best my by kid by not saying where i was , " offers one .
families and prisons 7 % of children will see a parent imprisoned during school years every year 150,000 children have a parent in prison two thirds of women prisoners are mothers one in four families has a five-hour round trip for prison visits one in five married prisoners will be separated as a result 45 % of prisoners lose contact with family during sentence sources : prison reform trust and pops another says the course has helped him realise the impact it has had on his sons .
it 's not his first time in prison , but he says he now knows that he wants " quality of time with my wife , quality of time with my children - money means nothing " .
encouraging the men to think about the effects of their crimes on their families is at the centre of the course - as is the need to think about their role after release .
progress is not always easy .
some of the fathers seem distracted , others offer thoughts on " good parenting " that the course leaders patiently suggest they reconsider .
' devastating time ' the effects of a partner being sent to jail have been experienced first-hand by anita .
when her husband was jailed for manslaughter , she suffered a breakdown and saw her two young children suffer as a result of their father 's sudden absence .
unable to stay in their london home , they went to a refuge and then a new home in a new city .
" it was a devastating time , " she says .
her three-year-old son started bed-wetting and her nine-year-old daughter was so upset by the sudden separation from friends she needed counselling .
such experiences are not as uncommon as people may think , campaigners say .
when a parent is sent to jail it often means the loss of a large part of the family income , says farida anderson of the partners of prisoners and families support group . "
if a prisoner has a good family unit to return home to they 're less likely to re-offend , so it 's good for society " lucy gampell , action for prisoners ' families the emotional impact can be even greater .
for a partner left behind the separation can feel " like a bereavement " and many choose to pretend they have split-up , rather than admit their husband or wife is in prison , ms anderson says .
such decisions have knock-on effects for the children who , burdened with the secret , are unable to get the extra help they need at school , or from friends .
while anita has not told her children to keep their father 's crime secret , her daughter , now 12 , decided to do just that .
" she has had to make new friends and because of the shame of it she ca n't tell them . "
community prisons while crimes as serious as the one committed by anita 's husband inevitably lead to lengthy sentences and family break-ups , the government wants to do more to keep families together , particularly for those prisoners whose crimes were less serious . "
the one good side of it is that i have become a lot closer to my daughters " ' david ' plans for " community prisons " with relatively modest levels of security and closer links to the local area have been outlined by the home secretary .
charles clarke said re-offending falls when prisoners are helped to " reintegrate into society through developing their relations with their friends and family " .
" if a prisoner has a good family unit to return home to they 're less likely to re-offend , so it 's good for society , " says lucy gampell of action for prisoners ' families .
' absolutely woeful ' it is often those things that seem relatively simple that hinder a family 's efforts to stay in touch with a prisoner .
some complain of " days on the telephone " trying to organise routine visits .
there can be long and tiring trips to distant prisons .
children who have been excited by the prospect of seeing their parent then go through the confusion and disappointment of waiting for the next visit .
maintaining family ties despite such problems is worthwhile , however , says " david " , a father of two young girls , as his wife comes towards the end of a 15-month sentence for indecent assault .
having been left upset and confused by the sudden absence of their mother , the two girls - aged nine and five - were buoyed by the trips to see her , despite the " sterile " prison atmosphere .
a four-day home visit helped prepare them for her return , but mike knows the experience will not suddenly be forgotten when they are reunited .
" the one good side of it is that i have become a lot closer to my daughters , but the other side of it is that their relationship with their mum is not going to be the same . "

having a parent in jail takes its toll on children when her husband was jailed for manslaughter , she suffered a breakdown and saw her two young children suffer as a result of their father 's sudden absence .
unable to stay in their london home , they went to a refuge and then a new home in a new city .
" it was a devastating time , " she says .
her three-year-old son started bed-wetting and her nine-year-old daughter was so upset by the sudden separation from friends she needed counselling .
such experiences are not as uncommon as people may think , campaigners say .
when a parent is sent to jail it often means the loss of a large part of the family income , says farida anderson of the partners of prisoners and families support group .
if a prisoner has a good family unit to return home to they 're less likely to re-offend , so it 's good for society lucy gampell , action for prisoners ' families the emotional impact can be even greater .
for a partner left behind the separation can feel " like a bereavement " and many choose to pretend they have split-up , rather than admit their husband or wife is in prison , ms anderson says .
such decisions have knock-on effects for the children who , burdened with the secret , are unable to get the extra help they need at school , or from friends .
while anita has not told her children to keep their father 's crime secret , her daughter , now 12 , decided to do just that .
" she has had to make new friends and because of the shame of it she ca n't tell them . "
community prisons while crimes as serious as the one committed by anita 's husband inevitably lead to lengthy sentences and family break-ups , the government wants to do more to keep families together , particularly for those prisoners whose crimes were less serious .
the one good side of it is that i have become a lot closer to my daughters ' david ' plans for " community prisons " with relatively modest levels of security and closer links to the local area have been outlined by the home secretary .
charles clarke said re-offending falls when prisoners are helped to " reintegrate into society through developing their relations with their friends and family " .
" if a prisoner has a good family unit to return home to they 're less likely to re-offend , so it 's good for society , " says lucy gampell of action for prisoners ' families .
' absolutely woeful ' it is often those things that seem relatively simple that hinder a family 's efforts to stay in touch with a prisoner .
some complain of " days on the telephone " trying to organise routine visits .
there can be long and tiring trips to distant prisons .
children who have been excited by the prospect of seeing their parent then go through the confusion and disappointment of waiting for the next visit .
maintaining family ties despite such problems is worthwhile , however , says " david " , a father of two young girls , as his wife comes towards the end of a 15-month sentence for indecent assault .
having been left upset and confused by the sudden absence of their mother , the two girls - aged nine and five - were buoyed by the trips to see her , despite the " sterile " prison atmosphere .
a four-day home visit helped prepare them for her return , but mike knows the experience will not suddenly be forgotten when they are reunited .
" the one good side of it is that i have become a lot closer to my daughters , but the other side of it is that their relationship with their mum is not going to be the same . "

now they are introducing a new technology that some say threatens a fundamental invasion of our privacy .
we are all familiar with barcodes , those product fingerprints that save cashiers the bother of keying in the code number of everything we buy .
now , meet their replacement : the rfid tag , or radio frequency id tag .
these smart labels consist of a tiny chip surrounded by a coiled antenna .
good tracking while barcodes need to be manually scanned , rfid simply broadcasts its presence and data to electronic readers .
it means the computer networks of companies can track the position and progress of billions of products on rail , road , sea and shelf . "
you start to ask yourself : ' who has the ability to read the chips and what do they do with the information ? " '
vint cerf , internet pioneer albrecht von truchsess , from the german supermarket chain metro group , which uses this technology , says : " rfid really brings a revolution to everything that is transported from one point to the other , and in the future you will have it really on everything .
" that means that we do n't have to do anything while the goods are on the way from the production site to our stores .
it is just done automatically . "
for all the benefits the technology promises , the roll-out of rfid is in danger of being derailed by the public 's perception of it .
a christian author in the us , for example , has just published a book claiming rfid will evolve into the mark of the beast featured in revelation and presage the end of the world .
' big brother ' ?
the technology has also attracted criticism from more moderate voices .
among these is vint cerf .
he is one of the inventors of the internet and is now employed by google as the company 's internet evangelist .
he told click : " what everybody worries about is that these identifiers will be used not to keep track of the object , but of the person associated with the object and then there 's a big brother scenario that everybody worries about .
" but when the economics get to the point where the readers are inexpensive and the chips are inexpensive , then you start to ask yourself who has the ability to read the chips and what do they do with the information ? "
metro sees rfid working for it by having food traceable back to the farm , queues cut to nothing , and shelves that shout when they are empty .
but with remotely readable tags on everything from boots to beans , is it the customers or what they buy that is being labelled ?
former australian privacy commissioner malcolm crompton says : " if done wrongly , it really is possible that i can buy things in one shop and be tracked in another shop , that the data , once collected , stays there for someone to come in and collect and use under circumstances that i do n't know about or that i do n't approve of .
" i think that is when society is on a slippery slope . "
the fear is that what we buy will be forever linked to us .
in the nightmare scenario , an innocently discarded soft drink can could end up in what later becomes a crime scene .
rfid could open a whole new field of forensics where the tag on the can removes any reasonable doubt .
taking steps concerns about rfid have been taken up by viviane reding , the european commissioner for information society and media .
she has recently launched a public consultation process with a view to seeing whether rfid needs to be regulated .
she says : " a new technology that is bound to be multiplied by 10 to 15 times in the next coming years in numbers of sales will not fly , and will not be of benefit to the community and to the economy if the consumers are afraid that this technology might be a threat to their privacy . "
one solution being floated is the idea of killing the code on the chip as customers leave the shop .
whatever comes out of the european commission 's consultation , it looks likely that your saturday shop will never be the same again .

now they are introducing a new technology that some say threatens a fundamental invasion of our privacy .
we are all familiar with barcodes , those product fingerprints that save cashiers the bother of keying in the code number of everything we buy .
now , meet their replacement : the rfid tag , or radio frequency id tag .
these smart labels consist of a tiny chip surrounded by a coiled antenna .
good tracking while barcodes need to be manually scanned , rfid simply broadcasts its presence and data to electronic readers .
it means the computer networks of companies can track the position and progress of billions of products on rail , road , sea and shelf .
you start to ask yourself : ' who has the ability to read the chips and what do they do with the information ? '
vint cerf , internet pioneer albrecht von truchsess , from the german supermarket chain metro group , which uses this technology , says : " rfid really brings a revolution to everything that is transported from one point to the other , and in the future you will have it really on everything .
" that means that we do n't have to do anything while the goods are on the way from the production site to our stores .
it is just done automatically . "
for all the benefits the technology promises , the roll-out of rfid is in danger of being derailed by the public 's perception of it .
a christian author in the us , for example , has just published a book claiming rfid will evolve into the mark of the beast featured in revelation and presage the end of the world .
' big brother ' ?
the technology has also attracted criticism from more moderate voices .
among these is vint cerf .
he is one of the inventors of the internet and is now employed by google as the company 's internet evangelist .
he told click : " what everybody worries about is that these identifiers will be used not to keep track of the object , but of the person associated with the object and then there 's a big brother scenario that everybody worries about .
" but when the economics get to the point where the readers are inexpensive and the chips are inexpensive , then you start to ask yourself who has the ability to read the chips and what do they do with the information ? "
metro sees rfid working for it by having food traceable back to the farm , queues cut to nothing , and shelves that shout when they are empty .
slippery slope : could your discarded items come back to haunt you ?
but with remotely readable tags on everything from boots to beans , is it the customers or what they buy that is being labelled ?
former australian privacy commissioner malcolm crompton says : " if done wrongly , it really is possible that i can buy things in one shop and be tracked in another shop , that the data , once collected , stays there for someone to come in and collect and use under circumstances that i do n't know about or that i do n't approve of .
" i think that is when society is on a slippery slope . "
the fear is that what we buy will be forever linked to us .
in the nightmare scenario , an innocently discarded soft drink can could end up in what later becomes a crime scene .
rfid could open a whole new field of forensics where the tag on the can removes any reasonable doubt .
taking steps concerns about rfid have been taken up by viviane reding , the european commissioner for information society and media .
she has recently launched a public consultation process with a view to seeing whether rfid needs to be regulated .
she says : " a new technology that is bound to be multiplied by 10 to 15 times in the next coming years in numbers of sales will not fly , and will not be of benefit to the community and to the economy if the consumers are afraid that this technology might be a threat to their privacy . "

now they are introducing a new technology that some say threatens a fundamental invasion of our privacy .
we are all familiar with barcodes , those product fingerprints that save cashiers the bother of keying in the code number of everything we buy .
now , meet their replacement : the rfid tag , or radio frequency id tag .
these smart labels consist of a tiny chip surrounded by a coiled antenna .
good tracking while barcodes need to be manually scanned , rfid simply broadcasts its presence and data to electronic readers .
it means the computer networks of companies can track the position and progress of billions of products on rail , road , sea and shelf .
you start to ask yourself : ' who has the ability to read the chips and what do they do with the information ? '
vint cerf , internet pioneer albrecht von truchsess , from the german supermarket chain metro group , which uses this technology , says : " rfid really brings a revolution to everything that is transported from one point to the other , and in the future you will have it really on everything .
" that means that we do n't have to do anything while the goods are on the way from the production site to our stores .
it is just done automatically . "
for all the benefits the technology promises , the roll-out of rfid is in danger of being derailed by the public 's perception of it .
a christian author in the us , for example , has just published a book claiming rfid will evolve into the mark of the beast featured in revelation and presage the end of the world .
' big brother ' ?
the technology has also attracted criticism from more moderate voices .
among these is vint cerf .
he is one of the inventors of the internet and is now employed by google as the company 's internet evangelist .
he told click : " what everybody worries about is that these identifiers will be used not to keep track of the object , but of the person associated with the object and then there 's a big brother scenario that everybody worries about .
" but when the economics get to the point where the readers are inexpensive and the chips are inexpensive , then you start to ask yourself who has the ability to read the chips and what do they do with the information ? "
metro sees rfid working for it by having food traceable back to the farm , queues cut to nothing , and shelves that shout when they are empty .
slippery slope : could your discarded items come back to haunt you ?
but with remotely readable tags on everything from boots to beans , is it the customers or what they buy that is being labelled ?
former australian privacy commissioner malcolm crompton says : " if done wrongly , it really is possible that i can buy things in one shop and be tracked in another shop , that the data , once collected , stays there for someone to come in and collect and use under circumstances that i do n't know about or that i do n't approve of .
" i think that is when society is on a slippery slope . "
the fear is that what we buy will be forever linked to us .
in the nightmare scenario , an innocently discarded soft drink can could end up in what later becomes a crime scene .
rfid could open a whole new field of forensics where the tag on the can removes any reasonable doubt .
taking steps concerns about rfid have been taken up by viviane reding , the european commissioner for information society and media .
she has recently launched a public consultation process with a view to seeing whether rfid needs to be regulated .
she says : " a new technology that is bound to be multiplied by 10 to 15 times in the next coming years in numbers of sales will not fly , and will not be of benefit to the community and to the economy if the consumers are afraid that this technology might be a threat to their privacy . "
one solution being floated is the idea of killing the code on the chip as customers leave the shop .
whatever comes out of the european commission 's consultation , it looks likely that your saturday shop will never be the same again .

" he 's a 21-year-old , he 's just finished 12 months at sandhurst which is pretty gruelling for anybody and he 's doing what thousands of youngsters do when they graduate , whether it 's from sandhurst or whether it 's from university , " he added .
' jolly evening ' both newspapers say the prince declined the offer of a lap dance in the club , in colnbrook , berkshire .
novelist and friend of prince charles and the duchess of cornwall , jilly cooper , told five live anyone shocked by the prince 's actions was " really very prudish " .
" i mean he had a lovely time .
he obviously got on with his mates .
he passed out in very gruelling circumstances - he may well have to go to iraq .
" he 's under a lot of pressure .
and then he goes out and has a jolly evening .
i ca n't see anything wrong with it at all . "
prince harry leaves sandhurst next week , and will be watched by the queen and the duke of edinburgh , the prince of wales and duchess of cornwall and his brother prince william as he marches in the traditional passing out parade and commissions as an officer .
he will join the household cavalry 's blues and royals regiment .

gtfm , which was set up in pontypridd in 2002 , was the first radio station in wales to be supported by the uk government , with eu backing .
it is run by five full-time staff and volunteers but has warned of closure unless funding can be secured .
the assembly government said it would not comment .
andrew jones , the station manager said : " we were funded mainly through objective one -lrb- european union -rrb- monies for the first three years , but that is n't available next year .
this grant that we 've lost may seem small , but it 's our lifeline andrew jones , gtfm station manager " we 've never asked for or been offered any money from either rhondda cynon taf council or the assembly , up until now .

" community radio stations are only allowed to receive 50 % of their income from any one funding source , including advertising .
" this grant that we 've lost may seem small , but it 's our lifeline , " he said .
he said the refusal of the grant was probably down to the radio station not being recognised as a community service .

another plaid am , leanne wood , said : " surely the last thing the government wants is to see money invested in projects and see them come to an abrupt end like this .
" there has got to be some strategic thinking and planning .

this year marks the 90th anniversary of the easter rising - but it also marks the largest collection of 1916 memorabilia ever to go on sale .
the collection , much of it on view to the public for the first time , goes under the auctioneer 's hammer on sunday and wednesday .
the 1916 easter rising marked the symbolic birth of the irish republic .
the leaders of the doomed rebellion were quickly executed by the british after a fight against hopeless odds and the might of the british empire , but their deaths inspired the drive for irish self-determination .
there is fascination in ireland about the rising and what inspired it - even among a vocal group of modern critics who argue it was undemocratic , a claim mocked by those in ireland who today revere the leaders , the great folk-heroes of irish nationalism .
the 90th anniversary sees two auctions .
up for grabs are items such as rebel leader michael collins ' typewriter , the hand-written first manuscript of the irish national anthem by its author peader kearney , and a vast store of memorabilia - everything from police intelligence reports , personal letters , propaganda posters , medals , to art .
the first written copy of the irish national anthem stuart cole of dublin fine art auctioneers adam 's , said : " one of the principal unique aspects of this sale is that it contains so much material that comes directly from the families of those who were involved , principally the thomas clarke archive which is , to my mind , one of the only intact archives from one of the leaders of 1916 .

clarke 's wife kathleen painstakingly recorded everything to do with his life .

there was little interest in memorabilia for the 50th anniversary in 1966 , possibly because ireland was a poorer country and many participants in the rising were still alive .
ireland 's economic boom has seen revolutionary relics rocket in value .
items stored in cupboards and drawers across the country have been brought to the auction rooms in dublin , often family heirlooms , with owners either keen to cash in , or fearful of caring for and storing items now worth huge amounts of money .

auctioneer ian whyte of whyte 's , who are also holding an auction which includes the personal papers of peader kearney , says that irish wealth in the economic boom now means that 90 % of 1916 collectors are irish-based , the reverse of 30 years ago when most went to the us and abroad .
but some fear the auctions could see the disappearance of jewels of irish political history and say that the irish state should have intervened to buy them .
" with the large amount of wealthy collectors around , the museums and archives ca n't afford to buy all this , they 'd need huge amounts of funds , " said mr whyte .
" the happy medium is where serious and responsible collectors have the pleasure of owning items , conserving them and insuring them - and then they lend it to the museums who would n't even have the space for much of this .
" but when they have big exhibitions , they can draw on the resources of collectors - which also enhances the value of their collections .
so the private owners are a resource for the national institutions . "
some collectors will be holding on to their memorabilia , while others will be buying at these auctions , mindful that in 10 years time the centenary of the 1916 rising could see another revolution in prices on anything to do with the irish rebellion .

auctioneer ian whyte of whyte 's , who are also holding an auction which includes the personal papers of peader kearney , says that irish wealth in the economic boom now means that 90 % of 1916 collectors are irish-based , the reverse of 30 years ago when most went to the us and abroad .
but some fear the auctions could see the disappearance of jewels of irish political history and say that the irish state should have intervened to buy them .
" with the large amount of wealthy collectors around , the museums and archives ca n't afford to buy all this , they 'd need huge amounts of funds , " said mr whyte .
" the happy medium is where serious and responsible collectors have the pleasure of owning items , conserving them and insuring them - and then they lend it to the museums who would n't even have the space for much of this .
" but when they have big exhibitions , they can draw on the resources of collectors - which also enhances the value of their collections .
so the private owners are a resource for the national institutions . "
some collectors will be holding on to their memorabilia , while others will be buying at these auctions , mindful that in 10 years time the centenary of the 1916 rising could see another revolution in prices on anything to do with the irish rebellion .
one wonders what the executed 1916 socialist leader james connolly would think of it all ...
the 1916 collection is open to the public .

this microphone , this spotlight ...
doing our thing , performing our poems we may be nervous as hell , but here we all stand with a story to tell so many ideas in this 13 year old middleschool mind of mine welcome to " slam poetry " , an art form born in chicago which has now embraced schools across the united states .
the words are expressed forcefully , reminiscent of the way heavy rap is delivered .
the accompanying body motions speak of time spent on the street , of attitude and of a " listen to me , i have something to say " demand .
the piece of slam poetry woven through this story was written by mauricio gonzales , a 14-year-old hispanic teenager from the bronx , new york .
mauricio and his schoolmates at arthur toscanini junior high have taken part in a video conference with young people from buckhaven and levenmouth in fife in a project called digital link which may see the emergence of scottish versions of slam poetry .
the american teenagers stepped up in front of scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell , in new york as part of tartan week , and went through their repertoire , each poem prompting waves of applause from their audiences on both sides of the atlantic .
i wanna write about the intensity we create and the words we have fun with i wanna write about these metaphors and rhymes we write sometimes , stabbing us slowly in the soul , with a pen full of ink , full of meaning i wanna write about these similes wrapping me in a warm blanket , handing me a hot cup of coco after i shovel snow an organisation called dream yard takes professional artists into about 40 schools in the bronx and works on integrating art forms into the school curriculum .
schools in the district take part in slam poetry competitions via video conference .
co-founder jason duchin said : " it 's an opportunity not only for kids to compete against one other but to share poetry , to share skills , thoughts and styles and to interact with each other in a wonderfully supportive way .
" it presents opportunities to unlock the doors of their imagination and through seeing in concrete works of art the beautiful things that are possible gives people the confidence to realise those dreams , those things that they just imagine but do n't talk about . "
after mauricio and the others had completed their routines , the admiration in fife was unmistakeable .
dacquan brown , 15 , told the scottish teenagers that poetry was an outlet for them to express themselves through words and body expressions .
" poetry gives each poet in here a way to speak to the world with similes and metaphors and it gives everybody a way of listening to us without us having to get into trouble .
" i speak to the world in poetic manner . "
i wanna write about how 30 seconds ago my lungs were heaving , having trouble breathing and how it felt like there was a championship wrestling match going on in my belly , about how i did n't have to open my fists to know my palms were sweaty you may not see them now , but my kneecaps are shaking up and down like one of them back massagers from the sharper image back came the reply from scotland : " the poetry we mainly look at here is in the school curriculum .
it 's more historic .
we do n't have anything that 's modern or is expressive as what we 've just seen from you guys . "
then an observation from scotland of a difference between the two cultures .
" you guys love your country way more than young people in scotland do . "
right now i feel like we 're all one big family " dacquan brown bronx pupil " there 's a lot more confidence in you .
young people in scotland have a real self-confidence crisis at the moment and i think that you guys in america with slam poetry have a way of expressing your feelings and how deep they are . "
mr mcconnell , a former teacher , said : " i think we all know there are issues in scotland with the confidence of young people and we have to find new ways of helping young people become more confident and express themselves better in scotland . "
i wanna write about these other poets writing , reading , reciting , performing masterpieces we place into a master puzzle and my god , to be both impressed and intimidated by these poets i 've heard poems about politics , love , rape , hate , death of their loved ones , and death wished upon those they hated ...
alistair hunter , chief executive levenmouth ymca , had made the trip to the bronx to help forge the embryonic long-distance link .
his organisation works on helping to fulfil the aspirations of young people in central fife .
" we 're here to learn how they do what they do , why they do it , the benefits of that and we 're going to take that back to buckhaven and work out how we 're going to link these young people up so they can learn from each other , " he said .
the video link closed with talk of further hook-ups and of levenmouth entering a team in a future slam poetry competition .
the two groups had bridged their geographic and cultural divides through the use of technology and shared words with common and different meanings .
dacquan brown 's final statement to fife summed it up : " right now i feel like we 're all one big family . "

doing our thing , performing our poems we may be nervous as hell , but here we all stand with a story to tell so many ideas in this 13 year old middleschool mind of mine welcome to " slam poetry " , an art form born in chicago which has now embraced schools across the united states .
the words are expressed forcefully , reminiscent of the way heavy rap is delivered .
the accompanying body motions speak of time spent on the street , of attitude and of a " listen to me , i have something to say " demand .
mauricio gonzales -lrb- far right -rrb- and his schoolmates the piece of slam poetry woven through this story was written by mauricio gonzales , a 14-year-old hispanic teenager from the bronx , new york .
mauricio and his schoolmates at arthur toscanini junior high have taken part in a video conference with young people from buckhaven and levenmouth in fife in a project called digital link which may see the emergence of scottish versions of slam poetry .
the american teenagers stepped up in front of scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell , in new york as part of tartan week , and went through their repertoire , each poem prompting waves of applause from their audiences on both sides of the atlantic .
i wanna write about the intensity we create and the words we have fun with i wanna write about these metaphors and rhymes we write sometimes , stabbing us slowly in the soul , with a pen full of ink , full of meaning i wanna write about these similes wrapping me in a warm blanket , handing me a hot cup of coco after i shovel snow an organisation called dream yard takes professional artists into about 40 schools in the bronx and works on integrating art forms into the school curriculum .
schools in the district take part in slam poetry competitions via video conference .
co-founder jason duchin said : " it 's an opportunity not only for kids to compete against one other but to share poetry , to share skills , thoughts and styles and to interact with each other in a wonderfully supportive way .
the bronx and levenmouth came together on a video link " it presents opportunities to unlock the doors of their imagination and through seeing in concrete works of art the beautiful things that are possible gives people the confidence to realise those dreams , those things that they just imagine but do n't talk about . "
after mauricio and the others had completed their routines , the admiration in fife was unmistakeable .
dacquan brown , 15 , told the scottish teenagers that poetry was an outlet for them to express themselves through words and body expressions .
" poetry gives each poet in here a way to speak to the world with similes and metaphors and it gives everybody a way of listening to us without us having to get into trouble .
" i speak to the world in poetic manner . "
i wanna write about how 30 seconds ago my lungs were heaving , having trouble breathing and how it felt like there was a championship wrestling match going on in my belly , about how i did n't have to open my fists to know my palms were sweaty you may not see them now , but my kneecaps are shaking up and down like one of them back massagers from the sharper image back came the reply from scotland : " the poetry we mainly look at here is in the school curriculum .
it 's more historic .
we do n't have anything that 's modern or is expressive as what we 've just seen from you guys . "
then an observation from scotland of a difference between the two cultures .
" you guys love your country way more than young people in scotland do .
right now i feel like we 're all one big family dacquan brown bronx pupil " there 's a lot more confidence in you .
young people in scotland have a real self-confidence crisis at the moment and i think that you guys in america with slam poetry have a way of expressing your feelings and how deep they are . "
mr mcconnell , a former teacher , said : " i think we all know there are issues in scotland with the confidence of young people and we have to find new ways of helping young people become more confident and express themselves better in scotland . "
i wanna write about these other poets writing , reading , reciting , performing masterpieces we place into a master puzzle and my god , to be both impressed and intimidated by these poets i 've heard poems about politics , love , rape , hate , death of their loved ones , and death wished upon those they hated ...
alistair hunter , chief executive levenmouth ymca , had made the trip to the bronx to help forge the embryonic long-distance link .
his organisation works on helping to fulfil the aspirations of young people in central fife .
" we 're here to learn how they do what they do , why they do it , the benefits of that and we 're going to take that back to buckhaven and work out how we 're going to link these young people up so they can learn from each other , " he said .
the video link closed with talk of further hook-ups and of levenmouth entering a team in a future slam poetry competition .
the two groups had bridged their geographic and cultural divides through the use of technology and shared words with common and different meanings .
dacquan brown 's final statement to fife summed it up : " right now i feel like we 're all one big family . "

this microphone , this spotlight ...
doing our thing , performing our poems we may be nervous as hell , but here we all stand with a story to tell so many ideas in this 13 year old middleschool mind of mine welcome to " slam poetry " , an art form born in chicago which has now embraced schools across the united states .
the words are expressed forcefully , reminiscent of the way heavy rap is delivered .
the accompanying body motions speak of time spent on the street , of attitude and of a " listen to me , i have something to say " demand .
mauricio gonzales -lrb- far right -rrb- and his schoolmates the piece of slam poetry woven through this story was written by mauricio gonzales , a 14-year-old hispanic teenager from the bronx , new york .
mauricio and his schoolmates at arthur toscanini junior high have taken part in a video conference with young people from buckhaven and levenmouth in fife in a project called digital link which may see the emergence of scottish versions of slam poetry .
the american teenagers stepped up in front of scotland 's first minister jack mcconnell , in new york as part of tartan week , and went through their repertoire , each poem prompting waves of applause from their audiences on both sides of the atlantic .
i wanna write about the intensity we create and the words we have fun with i wanna write about these metaphors and rhymes we write sometimes , stabbing us slowly in the soul , with a pen full of ink , full of meaning i wanna write about these similes wrapping me in a warm blanket , handing me a hot cup of coco after i shovel snow an organisation called dream yard takes professional artists into about 40 schools in the bronx and works on integrating art forms into the school curriculum .
schools in the district take part in slam poetry competitions via video conference .
co-founder jason duchin said : " it 's an opportunity not only for kids to compete against one other but to share poetry , to share skills , thoughts and styles and to interact with each other in a wonderfully supportive way .
the bronx and levenmouth came together on a video link " it presents opportunities to unlock the doors of their imagination and through seeing in concrete works of art the beautiful things that are possible gives people the confidence to realise those dreams , those things that they just imagine but do n't talk about . "
after mauricio and the others had completed their routines , the admiration in fife was unmistakeable .
dacquan brown , 15 , told the scottish teenagers that poetry was an outlet for them to express themselves through words and body expressions .
" poetry gives each poet in here a way to speak to the world with similes and metaphors and it gives everybody a way of listening to us without us having to get into trouble .
" i speak to the world in poetic manner . "
i wanna write about how 30 seconds ago my lungs were heaving , having trouble breathing and how it felt like there was a championship wrestling match going on in my belly , about how i did n't have to open my fists to know my palms were sweaty you may not see them now , but my kneecaps are shaking up and down like one of them back massagers from the sharper image back came the reply from scotland : " the poetry we mainly look at here is in the school curriculum .
it 's more historic .
we do n't have anything that 's modern or is expressive as what we 've just seen from you guys . "
then an observation from scotland of a difference between the two cultures .
" you guys love your country way more than young people in scotland do .
right now i feel like we 're all one big family dacquan brown bronx pupil " there 's a lot more confidence in you .
young people in scotland have a real self-confidence crisis at the moment and i think that you guys in america with slam poetry have a way of expressing your feelings and how deep they are . "
mr mcconnell , a former teacher , said : " i think we all know there are issues in scotland with the confidence of young people and we have to find new ways of helping young people become more confident and express themselves better in scotland . "
i wanna write about these other poets writing , reading , reciting , performing masterpieces we place into a master puzzle and my god , to be both impressed and intimidated by these poets i 've heard poems about politics , love , rape , hate , death of their loved ones , and death wished upon those they hated ...
alistair hunter , chief executive levenmouth ymca , had made the trip to the bronx to help forge the embryonic long-distance link .
his organisation works on helping to fulfil the aspirations of young people in central fife .
" we 're here to learn how they do what they do , why they do it , the benefits of that and we 're going to take that back to buckhaven and work out how we 're going to link these young people up so they can learn from each other , " he said .
the video link closed with talk of further hook-ups and of levenmouth entering a team in a future slam poetry competition .
the two groups had bridged their geographic and cultural divides through the use of technology and shared words with common and different meanings .
dacquan brown 's final statement to fife summed it up : " right now i feel like we 're all one big family . "
do n't we all love this stage ?
