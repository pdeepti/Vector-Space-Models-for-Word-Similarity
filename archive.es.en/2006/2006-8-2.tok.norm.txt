additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

" in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .

the situation has become critical for the neckar river , one of the rhine 's major tributaries in southern germany .
the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour . " but if it does reach a critical stage , there are methods to get oxygen back into rivers , he said .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .
algae and other pollutants make this situation even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in the completely dry schwarze elster riverbed in brandenburg hundreds of dead fish have already been found in canals and lakes in berlin , and thousands of eels have died in wetlands along the rhine river near düsseldorf .
the situation has become critical for the neckar river , one of the rhine 's major tributaries in southern germany .
the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour . " but if it does reach a critical stage , there are methods to get oxygen back into rivers , he said . " you can let more water tumble over the dams , for example , which oxygenates the water throughout the churning action , " matthias said .
" also , some sewage plants have facilities to agitate or aerate water which flows back into rivers , which increases the oxygen levels . " of course , healthier waterways are n't just better for fish and other marine life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .
the intelligence service 's use of cryptic codes makes it unclear if the 11 other politicians knew they were delivering information to the secret police . birthler , however , said the new records do not shed much new light on west german politicians ' activities . " we are releasing files on 16 parliamentarians who had codes written next to their names , " she told german public broadcaster zdf .
" they could have been informal employees , they could be people who were used or people about whom the stasi collected information . " william borm -lrb- free democratic party -rrb- , gerhard flämig -lrb- social democratic party -rrb- , julius steiner -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , leo wagner -lrb- christian social union -rrb- and karl wienand -lrb- spd -rrb- were named as the five politicians accused of working for the national security service of the former german democratic republic . possible stasi i n flue n ce o n vote of co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandt -lrb- right -rrb- won a vote of confidence by two votes in 1972 the stasi is said to have influenced steiner and wagner during a 1972 no confidence vote for chancellor willy brandt -lrb- spd -rrb- .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part . " a connection to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron curtain divided germany until 1989 hülsemann can personally recall just what the atmosphere was like at the iron curtain - he and his parents checked out the german-german border from the west german side in 1986 . the term " iron curtain , " first used by winston churchill in a 1946 speech , caught on as a harsh metaphor for decades of ideological and political separation between the former soviet union and the rest of the continent to the west . " when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance . " you can find a lot of pretty good maps on the internet , especially from the former ussr , " said hülsemann , pointing to a cyrillic map of karelia , a region between russia and finland .
" there 's a lot of patchwork involved , " he said .
" i 'll have to go into the villages and ask my way through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian border guards cut a barbed wire fence , part of the iron curtain , in may 1989 asking may prove difficult , as hülsemann will have to rely on the village residents who can speak a bit of english or else make the most of hand gestures and sign language .
from norway through finland and russia to turkey and greece - that 's too many languages to learn beforehand . though it 's clear that hülsemann will follow the intangible iron curtain , his route will write itself as he cycles . " i do n't think you can plan so precisely , " he said .
" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part . " a connection to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron curtain divided germany until 1989 hülsemann can personally recall just what the atmosphere was like at the iron curtain - he and his parents checked out the german-german border from the west german side in 1986 . the term " iron curtain , " first used by winston churchill in a 1946 speech , caught on as a harsh metaphor for decades of ideological and political separation between the former soviet union and the rest of the continent to the west . " when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance . " you can find a lot of pretty good maps on the internet , especially from the former ussr , " said hülsemann , pointing to a cyrillic map of karelia , a region between russia and finland .
" there 's a lot of patchwork involved , " he said .
" i 'll have to go into the villages and ask my way through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian border guards cut a barbed wire fence , part of the iron curtain , in may 1989 asking may prove difficult , as hülsemann will have to rely on the village residents who can speak a bit of english or else make the most of hand gestures and sign language .
from norway through finland and russia to turkey and greece - that 's too many languages to learn beforehand . though it 's clear that hülsemann will follow the intangible iron curtain , his route will write itself as he cycles . " i do n't think you can plan so precisely , " he said .
" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .
it does n't make any sense to plan out every five or 10 kilometer stretch .
i know how long the route is , when i have to be where , where the border crossings are - and in between i 'll just feel my way along . " physical challenge not central hülsemann wants to get on his bike each morning around 9 a.m. and cover 150 to 200 kilometers per day .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .

but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .

most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production . " completed in wahnfried on nov .

i have nothing else to say ! ! " wrote richard wagner on the last page of the score for twilight of the gods . the composer may not have anything else to say , but critics and wagnerians have plenty to get off their chests , even 130 years after the first bayreuth festival and premier of the " ring " cycle . opinions were sharply divided when the first complete performance of the cycle came to a close monday evening and both " boo " and " bravo " were heard on the green hill .

most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production . " completed in wahnfried on nov .
21 , 1874 .
i have nothing else to say ! ! " wrote richard wagner on the last page of the score for twilight of the gods . the composer may not have anything else to say , but critics and wagnerians have plenty to get off their chests , even 130 years after the first bayreuth festival and premier of the " ring " cycle . opinions were sharply divided when the first complete performance of the cycle came to a close monday evening and both " boo " and " bravo " were heard on the green hill . " by now , one has to wonder if -lrb- director tankred dorst -rrb- ever managed to develop an interpretation of ' the ring ' or if his inspiration on wagner was exhausted after just a few decorative thoughts , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . two years is too fast for four operas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard siegel as the " mime " in what dorst conceived as siegfried 's physics classroom eighty-year old dramatist tankred dorst agreed to create a new production of wagner 's marathon masterpiece just two years ago , which left little time for polishing the rough edges and experimenting with new ideas . the result lacked " dramaturgical conclusiveness " and " well thought out characterization , " wrote one critic . in an interview with ap after performances of only " rhinegold " and " the valkyrie , " dorst handed responsibility for the less-than-perfect character development to the singers . " i encouraged the singers to personify their roles themselves , " he said . " but not everyone has the talent for that . " however , the high quality of singing " generally contributed to the fact that this ' siegfried ' musically outweighed the disappointment of a hopeless production , " continued the faz , referring to the third opera in the cycle . virginia-born tenor stephen gould struggled with nervousness at first , according to several sources , but pulled through with a generally convincing performance as siegfried . in contrast to jürgen flimm 's last " ring " production in 2000 , dorst decided against a brief-case carrying siegfried and avoided heavy social or political messages .
the problem was , according to critics , that he did n't manage to convey any convincing message . thielemann on fire in the pit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian thielemann the unanimous favorite in bayreuth this week was neither on the stage nor behind it .
conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
serious wagnerians typically arrive at the festival in tuxedos and evening gowns - not the most ideal attire for the sticky , narrow theater filled to the brim with some 2,000 spectators . it 's not surprising that many guests were seen rushing to the nearby kneipp water therapy facility during the intermissions to cool their feet in the shallow baths .
-lrb- sebastian kneipp was a 19th century bavarian priest who used water to treat all kinds of ailments . -rrb- another chance awaits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't show up in shorts , even though it can get toasty in the 19th century theater the summer heat will ease into fall and tankred dorst will have the opportunity to revise his " ring " production before next year 's re-run .
that 's the advantage behind the workshop-style festival , where new productions are typically performed over three to five seasons . dorst said he was only able to implement 70 to 80 percent of his original ideas in the final production , whether due to time constraints or conflict with the authoritative leadership .
having told ap that he does n't want to do another new production , it remains to be seen how motivated he is to refine this one for a more convincing clash between the human and divine next summer . " the ring " will be performed in its entirety twice more during the 2006 wagner festival , which runs through aug .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture .

but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 .

" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels .

" unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .

but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .
in 2003 , us group procter & gamble -lrb- p & g -rrb- took over wella - and 4711 .
now , just three years later , the product is up for sale again . p & g said it wants to sell off 4711 -lrb- and its equally unique-smelling sister products tosca , sir irisch moos and extase -rrb- " for strategic reasons . "
it wanted to focus on brands which had a high potential for global growth , it said . p & g said it would keep its fragrance production site in cologne .
but it would now focus on " lifestyle and celebrity " fragrances , such as those promoted by naomi campbell and cindy crawford . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " perfume " on its way to silver screen it took two decades but production of the movie version of " perfume , " the blockbuster novel by patrick süskind , has begun .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .
in 2003 , us group procter & gamble -lrb- p & g -rrb- took over wella - and 4711 .
now , just three years later , the product is up for sale again . p & g said it wants to sell off 4711 -lrb- and its equally unique-smelling sister products tosca , sir irisch moos and extase -rrb- " for strategic reasons . "
it wanted to focus on brands which had a high potential for global growth , it said . p & g said it would keep its fragrance production site in cologne .

this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part .

" when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance .

" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .

it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part . " a connection to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron curtain divided germany until 1989 hülsemann can personally recall just what the atmosphere was like at the iron curtain - he and his parents checked out the german-german border from the west german side in 1986 . the term " iron curtain , " first used by winston churchill in a 1946 speech , caught on as a harsh metaphor for decades of ideological and political separation between the former soviet union and the rest of the continent to the west . " when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance . " you can find a lot of pretty good maps on the internet , especially from the former ussr , " said hülsemann , pointing to a cyrillic map of karelia , a region between russia and finland .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian border guards cut a barbed wire fence , part of the iron curtain , in may 1989 asking may prove difficult , as hülsemann will have to rely on the village residents who can speak a bit of english or else make the most of hand gestures and sign language .
from norway through finland and russia to turkey and greece - that 's too many languages to learn beforehand . though it 's clear that hülsemann will follow the intangible iron curtain , his route will write itself as he cycles . " i do n't think you can plan so precisely , " he said .
" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .
it does n't make any sense to plan out every five or 10 kilometer stretch .
i know how long the route is , when i have to be where , where the border crossings are - and in between i 'll just feel my way along . " physical challenge not central hülsemann wants to get on his bike each morning around 9 a.m. and cover 150 to 200 kilometers per day .
that should take six to eight hours , which still leaves time to take in his historically significant surroundings and talk with the people he meets . in mid-september , frank hülsemann will return to germany with several thousand kilometers more under his belt , and countless personal impressions of modern life along the iron curtain - 17 years after its collapse . britta kleymann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old europe opens doors to eastern workers a majority of older eu states have decided to open their doors to workers from newer east european members and will be lifting or easing their restrictions , according to eu officials .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production . " completed in wahnfried on nov .
21 , 1874 .
i have nothing else to say ! ! " wrote richard wagner on the last page of the score for twilight of the gods . the composer may not have anything else to say , but critics and wagnerians have plenty to get off their chests , even 130 years after the first bayreuth festival and premier of the " ring " cycle . opinions were sharply divided when the first complete performance of the cycle came to a close monday evening and both " boo " and " bravo " were heard on the green hill . " by now , one has to wonder if -lrb- director tankred dorst -rrb- ever managed to develop an interpretation of ' the ring ' or if his inspiration on wagner was exhausted after just a few decorative thoughts , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . two years is too fast for four operas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard siegel as the " mime " in what dorst conceived as siegfried 's physics classroom eighty-year old dramatist tankred dorst agreed to create a new production of wagner 's marathon masterpiece just two years ago , which left little time for polishing the rough edges and experimenting with new ideas . the result lacked " dramaturgical conclusiveness " and " well thought out characterization , " wrote one critic . in an interview with ap after performances of only " rhinegold " and " the valkyrie , " dorst handed responsibility for the less-than-perfect character development to the singers .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .
algae and other pollutants make this situation even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in the completely dry schwarze elster riverbed in brandenburg hundreds of dead fish have already been found in canals and lakes in berlin , and thousands of eels have died in wetlands along the rhine river near düsseldorf .
the situation has become critical for the neckar river , one of the rhine 's major tributaries in southern germany .
the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour . " but if it does reach a critical stage , there are methods to get oxygen back into rivers , he said . " you can let more water tumble over the dams , for example , which oxygenates the water throughout the churning action , " matthias said .
" also , some sewage plants have facilities to agitate or aerate water which flows back into rivers , which increases the oxygen levels . " of course , healthier waterways are n't just better for fish and other marine life .
humans benefit as well .

martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .

he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .

but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .

" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .

" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .

it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .
in 2003 , us group procter & gamble -lrb- p & g -rrb- took over wella - and 4711 .
now , just three years later , the product is up for sale again . p & g said it wants to sell off 4711 -lrb- and its equally unique-smelling sister products tosca , sir irisch moos and extase -rrb- " for strategic reasons . "
it wanted to focus on brands which had a high potential for global growth , it said . p & g said it would keep its fragrance production site in cologne .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .

martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .

the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part . " a connection to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron curtain divided germany until 1989 hülsemann can personally recall just what the atmosphere was like at the iron curtain - he and his parents checked out the german-german border from the west german side in 1986 . the term " iron curtain , " first used by winston churchill in a 1946 speech , caught on as a harsh metaphor for decades of ideological and political separation between the former soviet union and the rest of the continent to the west . " when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance . " you can find a lot of pretty good maps on the internet , especially from the former ussr , " said hülsemann , pointing to a cyrillic map of karelia , a region between russia and finland .
" there 's a lot of patchwork involved , " he said .
" i 'll have to go into the villages and ask my way through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian border guards cut a barbed wire fence , part of the iron curtain , in may 1989 asking may prove difficult , as hülsemann will have to rely on the village residents who can speak a bit of english or else make the most of hand gestures and sign language .
from norway through finland and russia to turkey and greece - that 's too many languages to learn beforehand . though it 's clear that hülsemann will follow the intangible iron curtain , his route will write itself as he cycles . " i do n't think you can plan so precisely , " he said .
" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .
it does n't make any sense to plan out every five or 10 kilometer stretch .
i know how long the route is , when i have to be where , where the border crossings are - and in between i 'll just feel my way along . " physical challenge not central hülsemann wants to get on his bike each morning around 9 a.m. and cover 150 to 200 kilometers per day .
that should take six to eight hours , which still leaves time to take in his historically significant surroundings and talk with the people he meets . in mid-september , frank hülsemann will return to germany with several thousand kilometers more under his belt , and countless personal impressions of modern life along the iron curtain - 17 years after its collapse . britta kleymann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old europe opens doors to eastern workers a majority of older eu states have decided to open their doors to workers from newer east european members and will be lifting or easing their restrictions , according to eu officials .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part . " a connection to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron curtain divided germany until 1989 hülsemann can personally recall just what the atmosphere was like at the iron curtain - he and his parents checked out the german-german border from the west german side in 1986 . the term " iron curtain , " first used by winston churchill in a 1946 speech , caught on as a harsh metaphor for decades of ideological and political separation between the former soviet union and the rest of the continent to the west . " when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance . " you can find a lot of pretty good maps on the internet , especially from the former ussr , " said hülsemann , pointing to a cyrillic map of karelia , a region between russia and finland .
" there 's a lot of patchwork involved , " he said .
" i 'll have to go into the villages and ask my way through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian border guards cut a barbed wire fence , part of the iron curtain , in may 1989 asking may prove difficult , as hülsemann will have to rely on the village residents who can speak a bit of english or else make the most of hand gestures and sign language .
from norway through finland and russia to turkey and greece - that 's too many languages to learn beforehand . though it 's clear that hülsemann will follow the intangible iron curtain , his route will write itself as he cycles . " i do n't think you can plan so precisely , " he said .
" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .
it does n't make any sense to plan out every five or 10 kilometer stretch .
i know how long the route is , when i have to be where , where the border crossings are - and in between i 'll just feel my way along . " physical challenge not central hülsemann wants to get on his bike each morning around 9 a.m. and cover 150 to 200 kilometers per day .
that should take six to eight hours , which still leaves time to take in his historically significant surroundings and talk with the people he meets . in mid-september , frank hülsemann will return to germany with several thousand kilometers more under his belt , and countless personal impressions of modern life along the iron curtain - 17 years after its collapse . britta kleymann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old europe opens doors to eastern workers a majority of older eu states have decided to open their doors to workers from newer east european members and will be lifting or easing their restrictions , according to eu officials .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .
the intelligence service 's use of cryptic codes makes it unclear if the 11 other politicians knew they were delivering information to the secret police . birthler , however , said the new records do not shed much new light on west german politicians ' activities . " we are releasing files on 16 parliamentarians who had codes written next to their names , " she told german public broadcaster zdf .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass .

conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .

" by now , one has to wonder if -lrb- director tankred dorst -rrb- ever managed to develop an interpretation of ' the ring ' or if his inspiration on wagner was exhausted after just a few decorative thoughts , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . two years is too fast for four operas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard siegel as the " mime " in what dorst conceived as siegfried 's physics classroom eighty-year old dramatist tankred dorst agreed to create a new production of wagner 's marathon masterpiece just two years ago , which left little time for polishing the rough edges and experimenting with new ideas . the result lacked " dramaturgical conclusiveness " and " well thought out characterization , " wrote one critic . in an interview with ap after performances of only " rhinegold " and " the valkyrie , " dorst handed responsibility for the less-than-perfect character development to the singers . " i encouraged the singers to personify their roles themselves , " he said . " but not everyone has the talent for that .

conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
serious wagnerians typically arrive at the festival in tuxedos and evening gowns - not the most ideal attire for the sticky , narrow theater filled to the brim with some 2,000 spectators . it 's not surprising that many guests were seen rushing to the nearby kneipp water therapy facility during the intermissions to cool their feet in the shallow baths .

that 's the advantage behind the workshop-style festival , where new productions are typically performed over three to five seasons . dorst said he was only able to implement 70 to 80 percent of his original ideas in the final production , whether due to time constraints or conflict with the authoritative leadership .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .
algae and other pollutants make this situation even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in the completely dry schwarze elster riverbed in brandenburg hundreds of dead fish have already been found in canals and lakes in berlin , and thousands of eels have died in wetlands along the rhine river near düsseldorf .
the situation has become critical for the neckar river , one of the rhine 's major tributaries in southern germany .
the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour . " but if it does reach a critical stage , there are methods to get oxygen back into rivers , he said . " you can let more water tumble over the dams , for example , which oxygenates the water throughout the churning action , " matthias said .
" also , some sewage plants have facilities to agitate or aerate water which flows back into rivers , which increases the oxygen levels . " of course , healthier waterways are n't just better for fish and other marine life .
humans benefit as well .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .
the intelligence service 's use of cryptic codes makes it unclear if the 11 other politicians knew they were delivering information to the secret police . birthler , however , said the new records do not shed much new light on west german politicians ' activities . " we are releasing files on 16 parliamentarians who had codes written next to their names , " she told german public broadcaster zdf .
" they could have been informal employees , they could be people who were used or people about whom the stasi collected information . " william borm -lrb- free democratic party -rrb- , gerhard flämig -lrb- social democratic party -rrb- , julius steiner -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , leo wagner -lrb- christian social union -rrb- and karl wienand -lrb- spd -rrb- were named as the five politicians accused of working for the national security service of the former german democratic republic . possible stasi i n flue n ce o n vote of co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandt -lrb- right -rrb- won a vote of confidence by two votes in 1972 the stasi is said to have influenced steiner and wagner during a 1972 no confidence vote for chancellor willy brandt -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he stayed in power when the final vote tally left his opponent two votes shorts of the 249 necessary for a change of government . an additional 11 people were notified of the existence of their records in the stasi 's " rosenholz " files , which were kept on foreign contacts , and their files will also be released in the coming weeks if they do not request to keep them closed . the researchers who requested the files hope to gain new insights into the relationships between west and east germany , including details on brandt 's visit to erfurt in 1970 and a 1972 contract concerning how the two german states would fundamentally deal with each other . fi n al report expected i n 2007 birthler added that neither she nor the department she heads has held back any information . the german weekly newspaper die zeit had accused birthler of dissolving a task force working on the rosenholz files and delaying its report after as many as 43 west german politicians ' names were reported to be listed . birthler called the claims " absurd " and said her office is sticking to its plan of releasing a final rosenholz report by 2007 . the rosenholz files , which were given to birthler 's office by the united states in 2003 , contain microfilm versions of some 317,000 personal records and 77,000 files of gdr operating procedures , according to the stasi record keeping office . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former stasi officers coming out of the shadows former members of east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , have increased their public profile recently , insisting that they are being libeled by the larger society .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .

olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .

most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production . " completed in wahnfried on nov .
21 , 1874 .
i have nothing else to say ! ! " wrote richard wagner on the last page of the score for twilight of the gods . the composer may not have anything else to say , but critics and wagnerians have plenty to get off their chests , even 130 years after the first bayreuth festival and premier of the " ring " cycle . opinions were sharply divided when the first complete performance of the cycle came to a close monday evening and both " boo " and " bravo " were heard on the green hill . " by now , one has to wonder if -lrb- director tankred dorst -rrb- ever managed to develop an interpretation of ' the ring ' or if his inspiration on wagner was exhausted after just a few decorative thoughts , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . two years is too fast for four operas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard siegel as the " mime " in what dorst conceived as siegfried 's physics classroom eighty-year old dramatist tankred dorst agreed to create a new production of wagner 's marathon masterpiece just two years ago , which left little time for polishing the rough edges and experimenting with new ideas . the result lacked " dramaturgical conclusiveness " and " well thought out characterization , " wrote one critic . in an interview with ap after performances of only " rhinegold " and " the valkyrie , " dorst handed responsibility for the less-than-perfect character development to the singers . " i encouraged the singers to personify their roles themselves , " he said . " but not everyone has the talent for that . " however , the high quality of singing " generally contributed to the fact that this ' siegfried ' musically outweighed the disappointment of a hopeless production , " continued the faz , referring to the third opera in the cycle . virginia-born tenor stephen gould struggled with nervousness at first , according to several sources , but pulled through with a generally convincing performance as siegfried . in contrast to jürgen flimm 's last " ring " production in 2000 , dorst decided against a brief-case carrying siegfried and avoided heavy social or political messages .
the problem was , according to critics , that he did n't manage to convey any convincing message . thielemann on fire in the pit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian thielemann the unanimous favorite in bayreuth this week was neither on the stage nor behind it .
conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
serious wagnerians typically arrive at the festival in tuxedos and evening gowns - not the most ideal attire for the sticky , narrow theater filled to the brim with some 2,000 spectators . it 's not surprising that many guests were seen rushing to the nearby kneipp water therapy facility during the intermissions to cool their feet in the shallow baths .

the problem was , according to critics , that he did n't manage to convey any convincing message . thielemann on fire in the pit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian thielemann the unanimous favorite in bayreuth this week was neither on the stage nor behind it .
conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
serious wagnerians typically arrive at the festival in tuxedos and evening gowns - not the most ideal attire for the sticky , narrow theater filled to the brim with some 2,000 spectators . it 's not surprising that many guests were seen rushing to the nearby kneipp water therapy facility during the intermissions to cool their feet in the shallow baths .

that 's the advantage behind the workshop-style festival , where new productions are typically performed over three to five seasons . dorst said he was only able to implement 70 to 80 percent of his original ideas in the final production , whether due to time constraints or conflict with the authoritative leadership .
having told ap that he does n't want to do another new production , it remains to be seen how motivated he is to refine this one for a more convincing clash between the human and divine next summer .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .
the intelligence service 's use of cryptic codes makes it unclear if the 11 other politicians knew they were delivering information to the secret police . birthler , however , said the new records do not shed much new light on west german politicians ' activities . " we are releasing files on 16 parliamentarians who had codes written next to their names , " she told german public broadcaster zdf .
" they could have been informal employees , they could be people who were used or people about whom the stasi collected information . " william borm -lrb- free democratic party -rrb- , gerhard flämig -lrb- social democratic party -rrb- , julius steiner -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , leo wagner -lrb- christian social union -rrb- and karl wienand -lrb- spd -rrb- were named as the five politicians accused of working for the national security service of the former german democratic republic . possible stasi i n flue n ce o n vote of co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandt -lrb- right -rrb- won a vote of confidence by two votes in 1972 the stasi is said to have influenced steiner and wagner during a 1972 no confidence vote for chancellor willy brandt -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he stayed in power when the final vote tally left his opponent two votes shorts of the 249 necessary for a change of government . an additional 11 people were notified of the existence of their records in the stasi 's " rosenholz " files , which were kept on foreign contacts , and their files will also be released in the coming weeks if they do not request to keep them closed . the researchers who requested the files hope to gain new insights into the relationships between west and east germany , including details on brandt 's visit to erfurt in 1970 and a 1972 contract concerning how the two german states would fundamentally deal with each other . fi n al report expected i n 2007 birthler added that neither she nor the department she heads has held back any information . the german weekly newspaper die zeit had accused birthler of dissolving a task force working on the rosenholz files and delaying its report after as many as 43 west german politicians ' names were reported to be listed . birthler called the claims " absurd " and said her office is sticking to its plan of releasing a final rosenholz report by 2007 . the rosenholz files , which were given to birthler 's office by the united states in 2003 , contain microfilm versions of some 317,000 personal records and 77,000 files of gdr operating procedures , according to the stasi record keeping office . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former stasi officers coming out of the shadows former members of east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , have increased their public profile recently , insisting that they are being libeled by the larger society .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .
algae and other pollutants make this situation even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in the completely dry schwarze elster riverbed in brandenburg hundreds of dead fish have already been found in canals and lakes in berlin , and thousands of eels have died in wetlands along the rhine river near düsseldorf .
the situation has become critical for the neckar river , one of the rhine 's major tributaries in southern germany .
the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour . " but if it does reach a critical stage , there are methods to get oxygen back into rivers , he said . " you can let more water tumble over the dams , for example , which oxygenates the water throughout the churning action , " matthias said .
" also , some sewage plants have facilities to agitate or aerate water which flows back into rivers , which increases the oxygen levels . " of course , healthier waterways are n't just better for fish and other marine life .
humans benefit as well .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .
a summer like this one will become a normal summer . " drought hit agricultural sector hard despite the many summer storms that swept across germany , the country had less than 70 percent of the average july rainfall .
this had a severe impact on the agricultural industry .
in the eastern german state of brandenburg , for example , farmers said their wheat yield was down some 40 to 50 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers feel the heat according to müller-westermaier , more heat required more precipitation .
but he said rainfall trends due to global warming have become more difficult to predict . " the models are not very good , but what they say up to now at least for central europe is that especially in winter we will have more precipitation , " müller-westermaier said .
" in summer , there will be less precipitation .
this is , of course , not a good forecast , so perhaps we will have to change our agricultural production in the future . " eu n eeds to wake up to water problems the situation is even worse for farmers in the mediterranean countries of france , italy and spain .
in the last year , reservoir levels in spain have dropped to nearly half of their capacity , which is a clear indicator of drought . climate change has exacerbated the problems caused by bad water management .
martin geiger , the head of the freshwater program at environmental group wwf , said that in countries like spain , more than 70 percent of water resources are used in agriculture - and much of this is wasted .
he said the european union needed to wake up to how precious a resource water is . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water has become an extremely precious resource " if the eu would link water savings to the subsidies they provide , this would impact the current water use because there are efficiently gains of up to 30 to 40 percent you can reach with modern technology , and only a few areas currently use those modern technologies , " geiger said . geiger said that unless co2 emissions are cut drastically soon , drought and desertification will become commonplace in europe .
he said that some water also needed to be given back to nature . " wwf is calling for environmental flows , which mean that you have a minimum amount for nature conserved , " geiger said .
" and not like in spain , where you use it first for agriculture and for tourism and then the households get something , and , ' oh , we forgot about nature . '
rather than leaving nature in last place , they should consider it in an integrated way , and include nature . " heat is killi n g fish the extreme warm weather has caused many of germany 's rivers and lakes to turn into stagnant pools , with very little oxygen in the water .
algae and other pollutants make this situation even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead fish in the completely dry schwarze elster riverbed in brandenburg hundreds of dead fish have already been found in canals and lakes in berlin , and thousands of eels have died in wetlands along the rhine river near düsseldorf .
the situation has become critical for the neckar river , one of the rhine 's major tributaries in southern germany .
the water temperature has risen to nearly 28 degrees here , and the oxygen levels are seriously low . " we have to watch the river extremely carefully , " said uwe matthias from baden württemberg 's environment , measurement and conservation office .
" we have numerous recording stations which measure temperature , oxygen levels and conduction , and we are checking these levels practically every hour . " but if it does reach a critical stage , there are methods to get oxygen back into rivers , he said . " you can let more water tumble over the dams , for example , which oxygenates the water throughout the churning action , " matthias said .
" also , some sewage plants have facilities to agitate or aerate water which flows back into rivers , which increases the oxygen levels . " of course , healthier waterways are n't just better for fish and other marine life .
humans benefit as well .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany .

" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

" in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .
the intelligence service 's use of cryptic codes makes it unclear if the 11 other politicians knew they were delivering information to the secret police . birthler , however , said the new records do not shed much new light on west german politicians ' activities . " we are releasing files on 16 parliamentarians who had codes written next to their names , " she told german public broadcaster zdf .
" they could have been informal employees , they could be people who were used or people about whom the stasi collected information . " william borm -lrb- free democratic party -rrb- , gerhard flämig -lrb- social democratic party -rrb- , julius steiner -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , leo wagner -lrb- christian social union -rrb- and karl wienand -lrb- spd -rrb- were named as the five politicians accused of working for the national security service of the former german democratic republic . possible stasi i n flue n ce o n vote of co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandt -lrb- right -rrb- won a vote of confidence by two votes in 1972 the stasi is said to have influenced steiner and wagner during a 1972 no confidence vote for chancellor willy brandt -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he stayed in power when the final vote tally left his opponent two votes shorts of the 249 necessary for a change of government . an additional 11 people were notified of the existence of their records in the stasi 's " rosenholz " files , which were kept on foreign contacts , and their files will also be released in the coming weeks if they do not request to keep them closed . the researchers who requested the files hope to gain new insights into the relationships between west and east germany , including details on brandt 's visit to erfurt in 1970 and a 1972 contract concerning how the two german states would fundamentally deal with each other . fi n al report expected i n 2007 birthler added that neither she nor the department she heads has held back any information . the german weekly newspaper die zeit had accused birthler of dissolving a task force working on the rosenholz files and delaying its report after as many as 43 west german politicians ' names were reported to be listed . birthler called the claims " absurd " and said her office is sticking to its plan of releasing a final rosenholz report by 2007 . the rosenholz files , which were given to birthler 's office by the united states in 2003 , contain microfilm versions of some 317,000 personal records and 77,000 files of gdr operating procedures , according to the stasi record keeping office . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former stasi officers coming out of the shadows former members of east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , have increased their public profile recently , insisting that they are being libeled by the larger society .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

he headed off wednesday on his next adventure : for the next six weeks , he 'll trace the former iron curtain , from the arctic sea in norway to the black sea in turkey and back to germany . " on a bicycle , you travel slowly enough that you can absorb everything around you , " said the mountain biker .
" you can take smaller paths … and that 's the fascinating part . " a connection to the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iron curtain divided germany until 1989 hülsemann can personally recall just what the atmosphere was like at the iron curtain - he and his parents checked out the german-german border from the west german side in 1986 . the term " iron curtain , " first used by winston churchill in a 1946 speech , caught on as a harsh metaphor for decades of ideological and political separation between the former soviet union and the rest of the continent to the west . " when i think that the -lrb- border -rrb- went from the arctic sea all the way to the black sea and divided not only germany but other countries that used to have a great deal of exchange , i find it very interesting , " said the 34-year-old cyclist .
" it really fascinated me and i thought i 'd just go there and take a look . " preparing for an adventure hülsemann has spent nearly a year researching his expedition on the internet and gathering maps .
besides packing the essentials - a tent , sleeping bag , camping stove and bike repair kit - not many details can be worked out in advance . " you can find a lot of pretty good maps on the internet , especially from the former ussr , " said hülsemann , pointing to a cyrillic map of karelia , a region between russia and finland .
" there 's a lot of patchwork involved , " he said .
" i 'll have to go into the villages and ask my way through . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian border guards cut a barbed wire fence , part of the iron curtain , in may 1989 asking may prove difficult , as hülsemann will have to rely on the village residents who can speak a bit of english or else make the most of hand gestures and sign language .
from norway through finland and russia to turkey and greece - that 's too many languages to learn beforehand . though it 's clear that hülsemann will follow the intangible iron curtain , his route will write itself as he cycles . " i do n't think you can plan so precisely , " he said .
" if the russian border guard says i have to go this way instead of that way , then i ca n't do anything about it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

many lakes and rivers are at record lows , aggravating problems already caused by bad water management . the heat wave that has gripped europe this summer has been breaking records across the continent .
in germany , dramatically high temperatures made this july the second hottest since 1901 .
a 1911 record for the highest july temperature in britain was broken when a village in surrey hit 36.5 degrees celsius -lrb- 97.7 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
and the dutch meteorological institute said this july was the hottest month in the netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706 . even though it has cooled down somewhat in the past few days , last month was still three-and-a-half degrees warmer than average , said gerhard müller-westermaier , an expert in climate monitoring at germany 's national meteorology service .
he said that the heat wave is part of global warming . " it fits the picture and it will continue to get warmer , " müller-westermaier said .
" we have had a warming of about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century and the forecast says that in the next 100 years , we may have temperatures 1.5 to 5.5 degrees warmer .

most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production . " completed in wahnfried on nov .
21 , 1874 .
i have nothing else to say ! ! " wrote richard wagner on the last page of the score for twilight of the gods . the composer may not have anything else to say , but critics and wagnerians have plenty to get off their chests , even 130 years after the first bayreuth festival and premier of the " ring " cycle . opinions were sharply divided when the first complete performance of the cycle came to a close monday evening and both " boo " and " bravo " were heard on the green hill . " by now , one has to wonder if -lrb- director tankred dorst -rrb- ever managed to develop an interpretation of ' the ring ' or if his inspiration on wagner was exhausted after just a few decorative thoughts , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . two years is too fast for four operas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard siegel as the " mime " in what dorst conceived as siegfried 's physics classroom eighty-year old dramatist tankred dorst agreed to create a new production of wagner 's marathon masterpiece just two years ago , which left little time for polishing the rough edges and experimenting with new ideas . the result lacked " dramaturgical conclusiveness " and " well thought out characterization , " wrote one critic . in an interview with ap after performances of only " rhinegold " and " the valkyrie , " dorst handed responsibility for the less-than-perfect character development to the singers . " i encouraged the singers to personify their roles themselves , " he said . " but not everyone has the talent for that . " however , the high quality of singing " generally contributed to the fact that this ' siegfried ' musically outweighed the disappointment of a hopeless production , " continued the faz , referring to the third opera in the cycle . virginia-born tenor stephen gould struggled with nervousness at first , according to several sources , but pulled through with a generally convincing performance as siegfried . in contrast to jürgen flimm 's last " ring " production in 2000 , dorst decided against a brief-case carrying siegfried and avoided heavy social or political messages .
the problem was , according to critics , that he did n't manage to convey any convincing message . thielemann on fire in the pit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian thielemann the unanimous favorite in bayreuth this week was neither on the stage nor behind it .
conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
serious wagnerians typically arrive at the festival in tuxedos and evening gowns - not the most ideal attire for the sticky , narrow theater filled to the brim with some 2,000 spectators . it 's not surprising that many guests were seen rushing to the nearby kneipp water therapy facility during the intermissions to cool their feet in the shallow baths .
-lrb- sebastian kneipp was a 19th century bavarian priest who used water to treat all kinds of ailments . -rrb- another chance awaits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't show up in shorts , even though it can get toasty in the 19th century theater the summer heat will ease into fall and tankred dorst will have the opportunity to revise his " ring " production before next year 's re-run .
that 's the advantage behind the workshop-style festival , where new productions are typically performed over three to five seasons . dorst said he was only able to implement 70 to 80 percent of his original ideas in the final production , whether due to time constraints or conflict with the authoritative leadership .
having told ap that he does n't want to do another new production , it remains to be seen how motivated he is to refine this one for a more convincing clash between the human and divine next summer . " the ring " will be performed in its entirety twice more during the 2006 wagner festival , which runs through aug .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .

" we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.08.2006 germany phasing out price protection for biodiesel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices at the biodiesel pump are likely to go up due to a new tax as biodiesel becomes a more common fuel among germans and farmers expand their fields to meet rising demand , a tax break for the fuel has expired , meaning biodiesel will become just as expensive as regular diesel . filling the tank with flowers just got a little more expensive for german drivers . an energy tax law took effect tuesday , lifting the bonus given to ecologically friendly fuels such as biodiesel by nine euro cents -lrb- $ 0.11 -rrb- per liter -lrb- about a fourth of a gallon -rrb- .
additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 . " it 's death in installments , " said karin ratzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry -lrb- bdv -rrb- . other german environmental groups were less perturbed by the phase-out of the tax break . biodiesel tax to bring in 1.6 billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry said biodiesel got too much of a break " we do not completely understand the excitement around the tax , " jürgen resch , head of the german environmental help association , told german public broadcaster ard .
" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .

it 's unclear whether they worked as spies . the files , requested by researchers and media , will be released sometime this week , according to marianne birthler , head of the authority that researches the gdr 's secret police . the west german parliamentarians ' names were listed in records as " unofficial employees " or contacts for the german secret police , or stasi .
five sets of records concern politicians who knowingly cooperated with the stasi .
the intelligence service 's use of cryptic codes makes it unclear if the 11 other politicians knew they were delivering information to the secret police . birthler , however , said the new records do not shed much new light on west german politicians ' activities . " we are releasing files on 16 parliamentarians who had codes written next to their names , " she told german public broadcaster zdf .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

" we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

additional annual increases of six euro cents per liter starting in 2008 will put biodiesel on equal footing with " regular " diesel by 2012 .

" the taxation of biofuels makes sense when the prices for petroleum products are rising .
not taxing biofuels could allow relatively high profits in the processing chain .
that would not be justified . " the cash-strapped german finance ministry also questioned the justification behind biodiesel 's exemption from the 45-euro-cent petroleum tax , and said it amounted to too much of a tax advantage in a statement to the press .
the ministry said it expects the new law to bring in about 1.6 billion euros in additional revenue . but renewable energy sources like biodiesel can not compete with fossil fuels because the newer technology is still faced with higher production costs , ratzlaff said . " we are not against a taxation of biodiesel , but we are against taxing it at an equal rate as fossil fuels , because then it can no longer compete , " she said .
" customers will only remain interested in biodiesel as long as it is cheaper than fossil fuels . " in their decision to drop the tax break , which became law at the end of june , government officials placed too much emphasis on other emerging environmental fuel technologies , ratzlaff added . a focus on undeveloped technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german biodiesel comes from rapeseed " the decision might have come too fast , " she said .
" the government may have focused on a next generation of biomass , which has a lot of potential , and i think politicians got the impression that this technology would be available tomorrow , but it will still take some time until we are able to use it . " unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

" unlike biodiesel , which is made only from the rape plant 's seeds with some of the byproducts used in other agricultural processes , biomass , which is currently being tested on a small scale in germany , can create energy from a number of sources including the entire rapeseed plant as well as agricultural and domestic waste . while the new tax will be a new source of income for the government , biofuels could also fulfill other goals , ratzlaff said . " the reasons behind using biofuels are to reduce carbon-dioxide levels , to have a secure source of energy production and to promote regional agriculture , " she said .
" the tax break decision does not help find a way to become increasingly independent of energy imports and leaves behind regional agriculture . " germany producing and selling more biodiesel than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have n't shied away from putting biodiesel in the tank before the new law came into effect , biofuel use grew steadily in environmentally-conscious germany and is now available at about 1,900 of the country 's 15,000 gas stations . the german statistics office also reported that 2006 's harvest of rapeseed was 6 percent higher than in 2005 , largely due to higher biodiesel demand , and that germany plants more rapeseed than any other country in the world . sales of biodiesel have increased because it is less expensive .
but in the face of higher production costs , it is the tax break that has made it less expensive for consumers , ratzlaff said , adding that , in the near future at least , biodiesel is likely to remain less expensive than petroleum-based diesel . she said she expects producers to pass some of the additional costs on to consumers and to make up the difference by lowering their profit margins . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german company fills tanks with sun rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .

the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded . germany 's federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe said on tuesday it was looking into two incidents , in which luggage with propane gas was found in the western german cities of dortmund and koblenz . " because of the proximity in time of the two discoveries of explosives , we are investigating an unknown perpetrator and possible membership of a terrorist group , " the federal prosecutors office said in a statement . the authorities said they were still investigating whether the suitcase bombs had been similar to one another or were capable of detonating . abandoned suitcases contained the bombs the railway station in the western city of koblenz was evacuated tuesday afternoon after lost-and-found staff noticed a gas canister inside a bag that had been handed in the previous day . on monday , bomb-disposal experts used water jets in the city of dortmund to dismantle a suitcase containing a timer , propane gas and gasoline .
a train conductor had found that suitcase monday afternoon behind a seat on the lower deck of a double-decker train that shuttles a three-hour route between the cities of aachen and hamm . the conductor handed the bag in to the lost-and-found office in the dortmund train station , where staff called police after looking inside . prosecutors said the 11-liter -lrb- three-gallon -rrb- canister of propane gas and nearly five liters of gasoline inside could have injured or killed train passengers if it had exploded in a crowded wagon . motives still unclear dortmund police said they remained uncertain whether the device had actually been primed to go off .
jürgen kleis , head of the team of detectives on the case , said in dortmund that german police had never had a case like it and the first step would be to profile possible offenders . the bomb construction was " professional " kleis added . " we ca n't rule out many possibilities based on our current investigations : a political motive , a criminal one or a private one , " kleis said . dortmund police were not even sure at what time of day the suitcase was left on the train , which had been on the move since dawn . last year a businessman , who had tried to extort money from a german bank , was jailed for 12 years for leaving a bag packed with explosives in dresden railway station in mid-2003 .

at the same time , spain 's foreign minister flew into lebanon on the eu 's behalf for talks on the crisis . " we have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in lebanon , " army chief of staff dan halutz told reporters in the israeli border town of kiryat shmona after the raid on baalbek , a hezbollah stronghold 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- to the north and less than 15 kilometers from the border with syria .
the raid was the deepest yet into lebanese territory . minutes later , a missile fell near beit shean , some 60 kilometers south of the border , hezbollah 's deepest strike yet into israel . police said at least 190 rockets had slammed into northern israel in what was by mid-afternoon already the biggest single-day barrage from lebanon since the jewish state launched its offensive against hezbollah on july 12 .
at least 36 rockets struck populated areas , killing at least one person and wounding 19 others . the barrage came a day after israeli premier ehud olmert said the offensive had significantly weakened hezbollah .
" today , the threat posed by hezbollah is not what it was .
it can no longer threaten this people , as this people have stood up to it and have come out victorious , " olmert said late tuesday . israeli warplanes meanwhile roared back into full-scale action , destroying two bridges in northern lebanon about five kilometers from the border with syria and killing three lebanese soldiers in the southern port of sidon . israeli forces were also engaged in a second front further to the north and were seeking to take the village of aadaisseh , police said . israel had called a 48-hour partial halt to air attacks after a raid on the lebanese village of qana sunday that killed 52 civilians , most of them children .
the deaths caused worldwide outrage and prompted calls for an immediate ceasefire . israel masses more troops on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel poured up to 10,000 troops into south lebanon but olmert dismissed the calls and israel broadened its offensive on the ground , pouring thousands of crack infantrymen , paratroopers and reserve units into southern lebanon .
olmert told british television wednesday that israel would continue to fight hezbollah until an international force - " an effective force made of combat units " - is deployed in south lebanon . justice minister haim ramon told israeli public radio the offensive in lebanon would last until the end of next week .
" i counsel everyone to show determination and patience and let the army finish the job , " ramon said .
" at the minimum , we have until the end of next week to react and try and finish the job . " ramon added that israel would " not negotiate with terrorists " nor would it " release prisoners to terrorist organizations " - apparently dismissing any suggestion that it might seek to exchange those captured in baalbek for two soldiers taken prisoner by hezbollah on july 12 . un security council prepares more discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council has only just agreed to start talking in a sign of progress , the permanent un security council members embarked on intense talks on the conflict and ambassadors said a resolution setting out a possible settlement was close .
" i 'm confident that by tomorrow we 'll be in a position to have discussions in the council on a text which actually takes us forward , " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones-parry told reporters . france and the united states had been divided over whether a political settlement should be agreed between israel and hezbollah before any international force is sent in . meanwhile , spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos arrived in lebanon on behalf of the eu and called for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's offensive in lebanon , followed by the deployment of un peacekeepers and lebanese forces along the country 's volatile border with israel . moratinos met with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora and offered eu support to his efforts to end the crisis before traveling to neighboring syria as part of european union efforts to end the hostilities . spanish fm in beirut , damascus on eu business " mr. siniora 's plan proposed a political dynamic for all parties and it is important that these goals be achieved as soon as possible , " moratinos said .
" it is important that hezbollah and israel accept the ceasefire as soon as the security council makes its decision , " he added , referring to an expected un resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lebanese pm is desperate for a peace deal besides an immediate ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners between lebanon and israel , siniora 's plan includes deploying the lebanese army in the south and barring any group except the official military from carrying arms . siniora has also called for the boosting of un forces in lebanon and international control of the contested , israeli-held shebaa farms border area . the plan foresees the disarmament of hezbollah , which was also a plank of a 1989 accord to end lebanon 's bitter 1975-1990 civil war as well as a un resolution in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree on immediate mideast ceasefire call the european union failed tuesday to call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east , preferring instead to demand an " immediate cessation of hostilities , " the bloc 's presidency said .

most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production . " completed in wahnfried on nov .
21 , 1874 .
i have nothing else to say ! ! " wrote richard wagner on the last page of the score for twilight of the gods . the composer may not have anything else to say , but critics and wagnerians have plenty to get off their chests , even 130 years after the first bayreuth festival and premier of the " ring " cycle . opinions were sharply divided when the first complete performance of the cycle came to a close monday evening and both " boo " and " bravo " were heard on the green hill . " by now , one has to wonder if -lrb- director tankred dorst -rrb- ever managed to develop an interpretation of ' the ring ' or if his inspiration on wagner was exhausted after just a few decorative thoughts , " wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . two years is too fast for four operas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard siegel as the " mime " in what dorst conceived as siegfried 's physics classroom eighty-year old dramatist tankred dorst agreed to create a new production of wagner 's marathon masterpiece just two years ago , which left little time for polishing the rough edges and experimenting with new ideas . the result lacked " dramaturgical conclusiveness " and " well thought out characterization , " wrote one critic . in an interview with ap after performances of only " rhinegold " and " the valkyrie , " dorst handed responsibility for the less-than-perfect character development to the singers . " i encouraged the singers to personify their roles themselves , " he said . " but not everyone has the talent for that . " however , the high quality of singing " generally contributed to the fact that this ' siegfried ' musically outweighed the disappointment of a hopeless production , " continued the faz , referring to the third opera in the cycle . virginia-born tenor stephen gould struggled with nervousness at first , according to several sources , but pulled through with a generally convincing performance as siegfried . in contrast to jürgen flimm 's last " ring " production in 2000 , dorst decided against a brief-case carrying siegfried and avoided heavy social or political messages .
the problem was , according to critics , that he did n't manage to convey any convincing message . thielemann on fire in the pit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian thielemann the unanimous favorite in bayreuth this week was neither on the stage nor behind it .
conductor christian thielemann was under the stage , where he had extra ventilators installed to keep cool during one of germany 's hottest weeks ever . thielemann , a berlin native , has been one of the most sought after opera conductors since the early 1990s and is a veteran of bayreuth , having conducted " tannhäuser , " " the mastersingers of nuremberg , " " parsifal " and beethoven 's ninth symphony there in previous years . behind his specially ordered fans , the 47-year-old conductor probably had the best seat in the house , as temperatures rose to over 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
serious wagnerians typically arrive at the festival in tuxedos and evening gowns - not the most ideal attire for the sticky , narrow theater filled to the brim with some 2,000 spectators . it 's not surprising that many guests were seen rushing to the nearby kneipp water therapy facility during the intermissions to cool their feet in the shallow baths .
-lrb- sebastian kneipp was a 19th century bavarian priest who used water to treat all kinds of ailments . -rrb- another chance awaits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't show up in shorts , even though it can get toasty in the 19th century theater the summer heat will ease into fall and tankred dorst will have the opportunity to revise his " ring " production before next year 's re-run .
that 's the advantage behind the workshop-style festival , where new productions are typically performed over three to five seasons . dorst said he was only able to implement 70 to 80 percent of his original ideas in the final production , whether due to time constraints or conflict with the authoritative leadership .
having told ap that he does n't want to do another new production , it remains to be seen how motivated he is to refine this one for a more convincing clash between the human and divine next summer . " the ring " will be performed in its entirety twice more during the 2006 wagner festival , which runs through aug .

germany 's " miracle water " with the characteristic aroma no longer suits the scent of the 21st century . it 's a scent many have smelled on a hot summer day traveling on a german train .
back in the days before they were air conditioned , it could get pretty hot in those train compartments .
luckily , refreshment was n't far off .
large numbers of usually older women would take tiny bottles with a distinct blue-and-gold label out of their purses , dab the content behind their ears and the odor of 4711 would waft through the compartment .
it was - as the advertising slogan from 1952 said - " the fragrance and freshness of cologne . " essential oils extracted from citrus fruits , rosemary and lavender are the main ingredients of 4711 eau de cologne .
it is n't a scent for everyone 's taste - especially for people under the age of 65 , although scores of young violin pupils might disagree .
due to the fragrance 's 85 percent alcohol content , some violin teachers instruct their students to use 4711 to clean the rosin left on the strings from the bow . slowing heartbeats and relieving headaches fragrance tastes aside , 4711 is nevertheless a cologne and german institution .
it was born in 1792 , when a carthusian monk gave the young merchant wilhelm mülhens the secret recipe for " aqua mirabilis " or miracle water as a wedding gift . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 4711 home in the glockengasse is up for sale , too shortly thereafter , mülhens set up a small factory in cologne 's glockengasse 4711 and began production .
this house number became the fragrance 's trademark . in the 18th century , it was marketed particularly for its medicinal qualities .
it could slow a racing heartbeat when a few drops were taken internally , and relieve headaches when sniffed through the nose , the accompanying leaflet said . but after a napoleonic decree in 1810 demanded the exact recipe be divulged , 4711 manufacturers decided to give their product a new image and market it as " toilet water " for external use .
this suited fragrance habits of the aspiring bourgeoisie - using intense scents to conceal bodily odors .
and the formula could remain secret . 4711 seems to indicate the wrong lifestyle today after 200 years of consistent success , 4711 has turned into something of an unwanted child over the past decade , though . german hairstyling specialists wella bought the mühlens group - including the rights to 4711 - in 1994 .
in 2003 , us group procter & gamble -lrb- p & g -rrb- took over wella - and 4711 .
now , just three years later , the product is up for sale again . p & g said it wants to sell off 4711 -lrb- and its equally unique-smelling sister products tosca , sir irisch moos and extase -rrb- " for strategic reasons . "
it wanted to focus on brands which had a high potential for global growth , it said . p & g said it would keep its fragrance production site in cologne .
but it would now focus on " lifestyle and celebrity " fragrances , such as those promoted by naomi campbell and cindy crawford . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " perfume " on its way to silver screen it took two decades but production of the movie version of " perfume , " the blockbuster novel by patrick süskind , has begun .

the controversial nature of the bill means days of debate are still expected as hundreds of amendments are tabled .
but the government seems assured of passing its version of a spy law .
the debate comes at a time of rising concern about government spying around the world .
hong kong first got a government spying law almost 10 years ago , in the last days of the british administration .
as was usual then , the law had a clause announcing its implementation at a date to be determined by the governor .
but the governor was gone three days later and the law never came into force .
intense debate now hong kong 's lawmakers are debating the interception of communications and surveillance bill .
like the earlier one , it seeks to regulate how the police and other law enforcement bodies may conduct covert surveillance or tap telephones .
it forces them to secure proper authority beforehand .
debate is intense , however , on what level of authority is best .
civil rights defenders believe the law is open to abuse by government .
they have tabled around 100 amendments trying to toughen protection clauses .
the government insists the law will not be used for any political purposes and that it offers hitherto unknown levels of privacy and legal redress to hong kong people .
concerns that the law could allow for spying on members of the political opposition are persuading members of the democrat party and others to veto this bill .
legislators have been called back from summer recess to participate , but parties backing the government are expected to have the numbers to pass it regardless after the next few days of marathon debate .

more than 60 % of those questioned by insurance firm direct line said the driving test should include tuition on how to drive on country routes .
the company has called for the rural speed limit to be reduced to 40mph .
but one mid wales road safety campaigner said that without police enforcement this was " unrealistic " .
the poll also found that 48 % of women found driving on rural roads difficult .

one area where most people in mid wales would expect this survey to be welcomed , is along the a487 coast road between aberystwyth and south-west wales .
a lot of drivers speed through the three villages councillor alun lloyd jones it takes drivers through the ceredigion villages of llanfarian , rhydyfelin and blaenplwyf , where people have been campaigning for years for tighter speed restrictions .
but local councillor alun lloyd jones branded the more general rural speed restriction suggestion as " unrealistic " .
along with others , he has fought for improved road safety measures in all three communities near aberystwyth .
the campaign has led to a 30mph limit through llanfarian , while bollards have been placed on a section of pavement .
mr jones said : " a lot of drivers speed through the three villages and there have been five deaths in rhydyfelin alone in the last 20 years . "
" i 've been campaigning to get a roundabout and a pedestrian crossing there since i became a county councillor in 1991 and my father campaigned too in the 1970s .
" other traffic calming measures have been put in place and rhydyfelin is a 40mph limit now . "
however , mr jones said that unless police were on the spot few people obeyed the limits .
mr jones says some people ignore the 30mph through llanfarian direct line said 64 % of road deaths took place in rural areas and that a quarter of those who drove in the country admitted speeding .
a spokewoman said : " the majority of motorists on the country roads in summer are likely to be unfamiliar with them and they can be extremely dangerous - especially when approached at high speeds .
" we 're also calling on the government to reduce the speed limit from 60mph to 40mph as we feel the current speed limit is too fast for narrow rural lanes . "
mr jones added that motorists needed to show " common sense " .
" there are some areas that need to be 40mph , but there are many other stretches where 60mph is perfectly fine " .

reporting their last results before they merge , mittal saw net profits for the april to june period rise to $ 1.09bn -lrb- £ 533m -rrb- from $ 1.02bn last year .
net profits at arcelor fell to 653m euros -lrb- $ 837m ; £ 446m -rrb- compared with 1bn euros for the same period in 2005 .
dutch-based mittal last month acquired the remaining arcelor shares it needed to complete the takeover .
mittal had been trying to buy luxembourg-based arcelor since the start of this year .
costly takeover battle arcelor said its results were hit by higher raw material costs and the expense of trying to fight off mittal 's approach , which it initially rejected .
it said it spent 182m euros trying to prevent mittal 's takeover , before eventually accepting its rival 's third , higher offer of 25.8bn euros in june .
arcelor also had to pay 140m euros to the russian steel firm severstal after it ditched a merger with the company in favour of going with mittal .
the combined group will have the name arcelor mittal .
arcelor mittal will have 320,000 employees and produce about 116 million tonnes of steel per year , about 10 % of world production .
the results from arcelor and mittal came after a brazilian judge said mittal must make an offer to buy out shareholders of a brazilian division of arcelor .
the ruling could add an extra 4m euros to mittal 's takeover costs .

reporting their last results before they merge , mittal saw net profits for the april to june period rise to $ 1.09bn -lrb- £ 533m -rrb- from $ 1.02bn last year .
net profits at arcelor fell to 653m euros -lrb- $ 837m ; £ 446m -rrb- compared with 1bn euros for the same period in 2005 .
dutch-based mittal last month acquired the remaining arcelor shares it needed to complete the takeover .
mittal had been trying to buy luxembourg-based arcelor since the start of this year .
costly takeover battle arcelor said its results were hit by higher raw material costs and the expense of trying to fight off mittal 's approach , which it initially rejected .
it said it spent 182m euros trying to prevent mittal 's takeover , before eventually accepting its rival 's third , higher offer of 25.8bn euros in june .
arcelor also had to pay 140m euros to the russian steel firm severstal after it ditched a merger with the company in favour of going with mittal .
the combined group will have the name arcelor mittal .
arcelor mittal will have 320,000 employees and produce about 116 million tonnes of steel per year , about 10 % of world production .
the results from arcelor and mittal came after a brazilian judge said mittal must make an offer to buy out shareholders of a brazilian division of arcelor .
the ruling could add an extra 4m euros to mittal 's takeover costs .

the cheapest broadband offer may not be the best nine million households in britain have turned their backs on these slow internet connections , and switched to broadband , freeing up their phone and allowing them to really surf the web .
some 70,000 homes are now signing up for broadband every week , making it one of the fastest growing consumer products yet .

if you all start uploading files at the same time , you 'll probably feel nostalgic for your old-fashioned modem open university : the cost of " free " broadband however , there is more to this than just consumer demand .
last year , an important regulatory decision changed the way broadband is supplied .
bt , which largely controls access to the internet via its copper wire telephone network , was told by ofcom to open up its infrastructure to the competition .
other companies can now control the wire that runs from your telephone socket to the pole on your street , and on to the local exchange .
the telecom term for this is " local loop unbundling " , or llu , and it sparked a process that has come to fruition with this summer 's incredible boom in broadband offers .
free broadband the first company to seize the llu opportunity in earnest , by going beyond existing regional attempts , was carphone warehouse .
it is known for being britain 's biggest mobile phone retailer , but its fixed line business talk talk has also been a success .
many people have been disappointed with the " free " offers its chief executive , charles dunstone , decided on a bold move into broadband internet .
he wanted to change the conventional way people were billed for broadband .
previously , customers were charged separately telephone line rental and calls on the one hand , and internet connections on the other .
if he could get control of the telephone wire into customers ' homes , he would be able to offer a £ 21-a-month package that provided the first two - with broadband included in the cost .
he turned this strategy into a bold marketing claim - his broadband was " free " .
trojan horse in april this year , as the offer opened to the public , the talk talk website crashed under the weight of demand .
within days , the offer had created a media storm , and it was becoming clear that the 170,000 new customers dunstone had banked on had been conservative .

ntl is the biggest supplier of broadband through their fibre-optic network .
about 40 % of the residents are already connected to broadband , which is slightly higher than the uk average .
a feeding frenzy began , as big companies like o2 snapped up small and medium-sized internet suppliers .
mobile operator orange absorbed internet service provider wanadoo - also owned by orange 's parent , france telecom - and shortly afterwards joined the " free " broadband bandwagon by offering it to customers on a £ 30 per month tariff .
as with the talk talk deal , orange were offering broadband as a kind of " loss leader " , attracting customers with something " must-have " in return for tying them into a lengthy 18-month contract .
for mobile and landline telephone companies , broadband had become a kind of trojan horse to get into their homes .
unsuccessful attempt we have followed three families as they tried to find their way through the maze of new deals and offers .
chris harris and his family found that the increased competition meant they could ditch their dial-up for broadband and still save money , but they also discovered there was a downside .
like others who signed up for the talk talk " free " broadband offer , mr harris found himself in a call centre queue , trying to find out why he had to wait for more than a month for the service .
mr dunstone apologised and offered to speed up the process .
however , confusion at the local bt exchange meant that at the end of july the harris family were still without their broadband .
broadband tv dave wilson and family had already been on broadband for 3 years through ntl .
sky boss james murdoch is keen to get in on the act despite having their own cable network to pipe broadband into their customers ' homes , ntl , which recently merged with telewest , is not immune to the fierce competition in the broadband marketplace .
mr wilson considered switching to the orange " free " broadband offer , but was persuaded to stay with ntl after they offered him a large price cut .
ntl has just announced a new package , offering broadband alongside tv , landline and mobile calls , which they hope will attract new customers , as well as hanging on to people like mr wilson .
and what about bt ?
in june , the company launched total broadband , which includes lower introductory prices and things like virus checkers included in the price .
bt also showcased new broadband services , which it claims offers customers the broadband of the future .
key to the strategy is a new television service via broadband , still in the pipeline but due to launch in the autumn .
hot market we met up with maureen harrison as she tried out another bt broadband gadget - a videophone .
she was attracted by being able to see as well as speak to her daughter and grandchildren , but was not keen on having to pay for separate bt subscriptions for her family .
by mid july , sky launched a much anticipated broadband offer of their own .
last year sky 's parent , bskyb , acquired a broadband supplier called easynet , which had expertise in gaining access to bt 's broadband network .
the bskyb offer , under boss james murdoch , continues the " free " theme by offering it to their tv subscribers as part of the package .
however , only around a third of them get to receive this at present .
analysts believe that the summer of 2006 will be remembered not just for its scorching temperatures , but also as the coming of age of broadband britain .

pre-tax profits rose 4 % to £ 1.78bn -lrb- $ 3.3bn -rrb- for the first half of the year , helped by strong cost controls .
but provisions to cover bad debts also rose .
across the group as a whole they climbed 20 % to £ 800m , and at the uk retail business they rose 16 % to £ 632m .
lloyds tsb said the rise reflected more customers experiencing repayment problems and higher bankruptcy levels .
the bank added that it expected " greater stability " in impairment charges in the second half of the year after it tightened its lending criteria .
lloyds said that in the first half of 2006 , more than 99 % of new personal loans and 80 % of new credit cards were sold to existing customers , where the bank has a better idea of the customer 's financial strength .
however , it added : " the rate of growth in the number of customers filing for bankruptcy and ivas -lrb- individual voluntary arrangements -rrb- does ... remain a key factor in the outlook for retail impairment . "
improved sales mix income grew by 6 % across the group as a whole , lloyds said , while costs increased by just 1 % .
in its uk retail banking business , income rose 3 % , while it managed to cut costs by 3 % .
this helped the uk banking side to report a 2 % rise in pre-tax profits to £ 713m .
lloyds said the uk business had been helped by a better sales mix , with less unsecured lending and higher levels of mortgage lending and customer deposits .
lloyds added that it had seen " excellent " growth at its scottish widows life assurance business , with a 35 % rise in new business weighted sales and a 15 % rise in pre-tax profits .
