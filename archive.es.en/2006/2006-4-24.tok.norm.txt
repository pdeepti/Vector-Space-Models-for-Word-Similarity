program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2006 germany hopes to help india spread the light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's hopelessly tangled electricity sector is in urgent need of a fix india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .
delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .

the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

they cited the example of apple 's itunes , which has grown in europe . but the hearing was short on drama or rhetoric , as lawyers got down to the technical haggling which will ultimately decide the case . biggest decision ever after a five-year investigation , the european commission made its biggest competition decision ever in march 2004 when it found that microsoft had broke eu law by using a quasi monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft nearly half a billion euros , the eu ordered microsoft to sell a version of windows unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by makers of rival products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says microsoft is hurting consumer choice although microsoft reluctantly paid its half-billion-euro fine and introduced versions of windows without the player , it has failed to satisfy all of brussels ' demands to correct the situation and filed the appeal against the ruling to get it overturned . separately from the trial , the commission has threatened microsoft with fines of up to 2 million euros per day if it finds in the coming months that the company is not doing enough to meet the demands laid out in the 2004 ruling . the trial holds huge stakes for both sides because a defeat for microsoft would leave it little choice but to bow to the commission 's demands , while eu regulators could find their authority seriously compromised if they were to lose . but it will not be until the end of this year , at the very earliest , that the judges will hand down their decision , which could then be appealed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .

wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .
it 's the first time the union has agreed to make added compensation conditional on a firm 's performance . kannegiesser stressed that in agreeing the rise , the employers had gone as far as they possibly could . " it 's an appropriate result for both parties , " peters said . difficult burden but the head of germany 's employers ' association , dieter hundt , said the agreement created a " burden " that many employers would find " difficult to bear " because the pay rises were much higher than was necessary to keep employees happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall leader jürgen peters he nonetheless welcomed as " significant progress " a provision allowing flexibility in organizing employers ' work . bernd gottschalk , president of the automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- , said the agreement would not improve competition or strengthen germany 's economy . the engineering and metalworking sectors , spanning industries from cars to semi-conductors , are among the most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . the 5,000 businesses in the sector include big names such as the thyssenkrupp steel company , electronics group siemens and car makers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen . tens of thousands of metal workers took part in a series of warning strikes across the country and the union had threatened to start an indefinite general strike this week . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de metal workers join germany 's strikers as a public service strike continues into its eighth week in southern germany and on the heels of a health care sector strike , thousands of metal workers cast aside their tools on wednesday .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- unions , employers prepare for bitter battle in wage talks employers and unions sharpened their knives for a bitter battle in upcoming sector-wide wage talks in germany , with unions calling for pay increases and employers threatening to slash jobs and move abroad .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .
critics believe more should be done to boost the dramatically falling birth rate in germany rather than setting up initiatives to provide for childcare . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

" we are committed to being long-term investors in the company and our intention is to support the company and its management - particularly at the supervisory board level - in executing a strategy of long-term value creation , " said blackstone chief executive stephen schwarzman in a statement . blackstone managed some 14 billion dollars of investments across the world last year , mainly in property and corporate debt .
it also advises firms on restructuring programs . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecommunications company , is planning to invest in new technology and cut thousands of jobs to counter a fall in its traditional fixed-line business as part of its restructuring strategy . foreign investment a positive step say experts despite fears that german jobs could be at risk from the involvement of outside investors , observers feel that the move by the german government to favor blackstone is a positive one . " the german government is clearly working with private equity to attract foreign capital .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2006 germany hopes to help india spread the light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's hopelessly tangled electricity sector is in urgent need of a fix india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .
delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation .

unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .
it 's the first time the union has agreed to make added compensation conditional on a firm 's performance . kannegiesser stressed that in agreeing the rise , the employers had gone as far as they possibly could . " it 's an appropriate result for both parties , " peters said . difficult burden but the head of germany 's employers ' association , dieter hundt , said the agreement created a " burden " that many employers would find " difficult to bear " because the pay rises were much higher than was necessary to keep employees happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall leader jürgen peters he nonetheless welcomed as " significant progress " a provision allowing flexibility in organizing employers ' work . bernd gottschalk , president of the automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- , said the agreement would not improve competition or strengthen germany 's economy . the engineering and metalworking sectors , spanning industries from cars to semi-conductors , are among the most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . the 5,000 businesses in the sector include big names such as the thyssenkrupp steel company , electronics group siemens and car makers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen . tens of thousands of metal workers took part in a series of warning strikes across the country and the union had threatened to start an indefinite general strike this week . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de metal workers join germany 's strikers as a public service strike continues into its eighth week in southern germany and on the heels of a health care sector strike , thousands of metal workers cast aside their tools on wednesday .

" the impact of this case goes far beyond microsoft .
the ability to innovate is important to the success of any company and the economic success of any country , " he added . determined to see the ruling thrown out by the court , the group has enlisted a small army of lawyers which it hopes will convince the judges hearing the case that the eu competition watchdog ruling is ill founded . but the eu commission team appeared equally resolute , despite having only about half the numbers of the 60-strong microsoft force . " the commission has a very strong case , i think the strongest it 's ever had , " said lawyer thomas vinje , who represents a trade body of big microsoft rivals like adobe , ibm , realnetworks and sun microsystems . after the presiding judge , dane bo vesterdorf , opened the first session , bellis attacked the commission 's position regarding its windows media player , charging that regulators had made " fundamental errors of fact and reasoning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taming the giant , or just picking on the big guy unfairly ?
he and other experts argued that there was plenty of competition for the windows audiovisual software and that in terms of numbers it was increasing .
they cited the example of apple 's itunes , which has grown in europe . but the hearing was short on drama or rhetoric , as lawyers got down to the technical haggling which will ultimately decide the case . biggest decision ever after a five-year investigation , the european commission made its biggest competition decision ever in march 2004 when it found that microsoft had broke eu law by using a quasi monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft nearly half a billion euros , the eu ordered microsoft to sell a version of windows unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by makers of rival products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says microsoft is hurting consumer choice although microsoft reluctantly paid its half-billion-euro fine and introduced versions of windows without the player , it has failed to satisfy all of brussels ' demands to correct the situation and filed the appeal against the ruling to get it overturned . separately from the trial , the commission has threatened microsoft with fines of up to 2 million euros per day if it finds in the coming months that the company is not doing enough to meet the demands laid out in the 2004 ruling . the trial holds huge stakes for both sides because a defeat for microsoft would leave it little choice but to bow to the commission 's demands , while eu regulators could find their authority seriously compromised if they were to lose . but it will not be until the end of this year , at the very earliest , that the judges will hand down their decision , which could then be appealed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .

" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .

" renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

police are still searching for leads as ermyas r. fights for his life in hospital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 alleged racial attack becomes political issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators march in potsdam against xenophobia an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case . federal investigators appear to be getting closer to tying up many of the loose ends around the brutal easter sunday attack on an ethiopian-born german that almost killed him .
but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

" we are committed to being long-term investors in the company and our intention is to support the company and its management - particularly at the supervisory board level - in executing a strategy of long-term value creation , " said blackstone chief executive stephen schwarzman in a statement . blackstone managed some 14 billion dollars of investments across the world last year , mainly in property and corporate debt .
it also advises firms on restructuring programs . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecommunications company , is planning to invest in new technology and cut thousands of jobs to counter a fall in its traditional fixed-line business as part of its restructuring strategy . foreign investment a positive step say experts despite fears that german jobs could be at risk from the involvement of outside investors , observers feel that the move by the german government to favor blackstone is a positive one . " the german government is clearly working with private equity to attract foreign capital .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 alleged racial attack becomes political issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators march in potsdam against xenophobia an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case . federal investigators appear to be getting closer to tying up many of the loose ends around the brutal easter sunday attack on an ethiopian-born german that almost killed him .
but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 alleged racial attack becomes political issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators march in potsdam against xenophobia an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case . federal investigators appear to be getting closer to tying up many of the loose ends around the brutal easter sunday attack on an ethiopian-born german that almost killed him .
but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . so a black man was beaten and it is now a racist item ?
wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .
the victim needs our prayers and the suspects need jail !
end of story . - hannover only insecure people will perpetrate racism . i strongly feel racists should be punished , but they should be treated first .
they are psychologically sick .
today it is a black man .
tomorrow it may be an asian .
and who knows when it will be a bavarian or a german from the east . - gmafany germany is doing the best it can against the neo-nazis , but more psychological studies need to be conducted to find out why young people are so attracted to such a violent ideology .
you can not combat it through education or legislation alone .
there are socio-economic reasons that contribute to the violence .
we are only beginning to ask what goes on inside of the neo-nazis ' minds and need to know more about the problem in order to effectively prevent it . - j. white feather , new york , ny schönbohm 's reaction says it all : he , as well as most germans , is in complete denial about the rise of racism and xenophobia in their country .
how can he claim that it ' may not be a racist attack ' since the attackers voices are clearly heard on ermyas ' wife 's voicemail , saying ' nigger ' ? ! ? - martin sauter , bath , uk i am a canadian citizen of jamaican descent , currently residing in berlin , and therefore a visible minority .
i had never been so aware of my skin color until i moved here .
it is a sad thing when one is confronted with racism anywhere .
however in germany , with its history , it is especially tragic when the attacks are so venomous , such as the one in which the ethiopian man was practically bludgeoned to death .
i did not expect to be so boldly confronted on this issue and had no pre-conceived ideas of how racist people can be here .
the eu should make it a priority to educate people , and abolish all groups that aim to suppress or eradicate individuals solely based on their ethnic origins . - kulawa compilied by dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .
-lrb- april 24 , 2006 -rrb- in beating case , new evidence and criticism even as dna evidence appears to implicate a suspect in the brutal beating of an ethiopian-german near berlin , one newspaper is contesting a racist motive behind the act .
-lrb- april 23 , 2006 -rrb- attack turns spotlight on right-wing extremism in germany in the wake of a racially motivated murder attempt in the city of potsdam , experts are concerned about the increasing aggressiveness of the far-right scene despite reassuring statistics on the actual number of crimes .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .

" christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .

" christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . so a black man was beaten and it is now a racist item ?
wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .
the victim needs our prayers and the suspects need jail !
end of story . - hannover only insecure people will perpetrate racism . i strongly feel racists should be punished , but they should be treated first .
they are psychologically sick .
today it is a black man .
tomorrow it may be an asian .
and who knows when it will be a bavarian or a german from the east . - gmafany germany is doing the best it can against the neo-nazis , but more psychological studies need to be conducted to find out why young people are so attracted to such a violent ideology .
you can not combat it through education or legislation alone .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . so a black man was beaten and it is now a racist item ?
wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .
the victim needs our prayers and the suspects need jail !
end of story . - hannover only insecure people will perpetrate racism . i strongly feel racists should be punished , but they should be treated first .
they are psychologically sick .
today it is a black man .
tomorrow it may be an asian .
and who knows when it will be a bavarian or a german from the east . - gmafany germany is doing the best it can against the neo-nazis , but more psychological studies need to be conducted to find out why young people are so attracted to such a violent ideology .
you can not combat it through education or legislation alone .
there are socio-economic reasons that contribute to the violence .

"
barragan , who is mexican , added that the vatican is preparing a document on condom use , but declined to reveal its details . opposition to artificial birth control in the past , the catholic church has steadfastly opposed all means of artificial contraception , even the use of condoms for those infected with the hiv virus .
hiv is widespread in the developing world , where the church is active on the grassroots level .
it has always maintained the position that birth control should be exercised by abstinence or natural means , such as the rhythm method , which has been mocked by critics as " vatican roulette . " bildunterschrift : cardinal carlo maria martini spoke out on condom use to halt the spread of aids up to now , the church had also condemned the use of condoms for married couples , even when one of them is infected with the aids virus .
hiv can be spread not only through sexual contact , but through the exchange of body fluids , such as blood transfusions .
in developing countries , the use of condoms protects against other highly contagious diseases , such as hepatitis , as well . condom use to prevent spread of aids only last week cardinal carlo maria martini , the highly influential former archbishop of milan , set a precedent by making a public appeal to at least permit condom use to prevent the transmission of deadly viruses . " we need to do everything possible to combat aids .

"
barragan , who is mexican , added that the vatican is preparing a document on condom use , but declined to reveal its details . opposition to artificial birth control in the past , the catholic church has steadfastly opposed all means of artificial contraception , even the use of condoms for those infected with the hiv virus .
hiv is widespread in the developing world , where the church is active on the grassroots level .
it has always maintained the position that birth control should be exercised by abstinence or natural means , such as the rhythm method , which has been mocked by critics as " vatican roulette . " bildunterschrift : cardinal carlo maria martini spoke out on condom use to halt the spread of aids up to now , the church had also condemned the use of condoms for married couples , even when one of them is infected with the aids virus .
hiv can be spread not only through sexual contact , but through the exchange of body fluids , such as blood transfusions .
in developing countries , the use of condoms protects against other highly contagious diseases , such as hepatitis , as well . condom use to prevent spread of aids only last week cardinal carlo maria martini , the highly influential former archbishop of milan , set a precedent by making a public appeal to at least permit condom use to prevent the transmission of deadly viruses . " we need to do everything possible to combat aids .
under certain conditions , the use of condoms is necessary .
those who are afflicted have an obligation to protect the other partner , " he told the italian weekly newsmagazine l 'espresso .
at the same time , he emphasized that this was not a green light for the church to actively start distributing condoms . softening of pope 's " rottweiler " image cardinal martini , a jesuit , is considered a moderate in the conclave that elected the then former joseph ratzinger from germany as pope last year following the death of john paul ii .
ratzinger , whom critics have dubbed " god 's rottweiler , " was a protégé of the late pope .
john paul ii took hard-line positions on the role of women in the catholic church and the treatment of homosexuals , as well as the condemnation of artificial birth control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in south africa alone there are an estimated 662,000 aids orphans though many german catholics take pride that the pope is a fellow countryman , the reaction towards the pontiff has been mixed from progressive catholics .
however the easing of the church 's absolutist position on the use of artificial means of birth control suggests pope benedict xvi could bring the church more in line with social realities and reformist views . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .
but no matter how the brazilians play , japan know they can match them because they already did in a 2:2 confederations cup draw . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links japan football association -lrb- jfa -rrb- feedback what do you think of japan 's chances ?

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .
but no matter how the brazilians play , japan know they can match them because they already did in a 2:2 confederations cup draw . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links japan football association -lrb- jfa -rrb- 9798 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the standard of aussie soccer is much better these days and the wizards from oz will look to go further than their first round elimination 32 years ago . world cup qualifiers after three previous attempts left the australian team watching the finals down under , a two-leg duel against uruguay that ended in a penalty shoot-out brought the australians to the long-sought finals . stars goalkeeper mark schwarzer , known as the aussies ' " german , " became a national hero when he stopped two penalty shots , giving australia a 4:2 win in the pressure cooker final against uruguay and a ticket to the 2006 world cup .
the 33-year-old 's parents left germany in 1967 , but much of schwarzer 's family still lives in germany , while he plays club soccer in england 's premiership for middlesbrough . trainer guus hiddink is the father of australia 's success .
after bringing then-host south korea to fourth place in 2002 , hiddink took a spot coaching the socceroos in july and preformed similar magic . world cup history australia will enter their second world cup campaign after making the finals the last time the tournament was hosted by germany in 1974 .

even though they did n't win a match in last summer 's confederations cup , the side introduced one of the tournament 's top scorers in john aloisi .
australian fans are also extremely confident in hiddink , who they expect will propel their side to even better performances than win over uruguay . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links football federation australia limited -lrb- ffa -rrb- feedback what do you think of australia 's chances ?

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .
but no matter how the brazilians play , japan know they can match them because they already did in a 2:2 confederations cup draw . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links japan football association -lrb- jfa -rrb- feedback what do you think of japan 's chances ?

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .
but no matter how the brazilians play , japan know they can match them because they already did in a 2:2 confederations cup draw . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links japan football association -lrb- jfa -rrb- feedback what do you think of japan 's chances ?

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .

zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .

zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .

the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .
but no matter how the brazilians play , japan know they can match them because they already did in a 2:2 confederations cup draw . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup 2006 all the latest world cup news from dw-world.de www-links japan football association -lrb- jfa -rrb- feedback what do you think of japan 's chances ?

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .

one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "

wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .

it is a sad thing when one is confronted with racism anywhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 alleged racial attack becomes political issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators march in potsdam against xenophobia an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case . federal investigators appear to be getting closer to tying up many of the loose ends around the brutal easter sunday attack on an ethiopian-born german that almost killed him .
but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .

that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .

"
barragan , who is mexican , added that the vatican is preparing a document on condom use , but declined to reveal its details . opposition to artificial birth control in the past , the catholic church has steadfastly opposed all means of artificial contraception , even the use of condoms for those infected with the hiv virus .
hiv is widespread in the developing world , where the church is active on the grassroots level .
it has always maintained the position that birth control should be exercised by abstinence or natural means , such as the rhythm method , which has been mocked by critics as " vatican roulette . " bildunterschrift : cardinal carlo maria martini spoke out on condom use to halt the spread of aids up to now , the church had also condemned the use of condoms for married couples , even when one of them is infected with the aids virus .
hiv can be spread not only through sexual contact , but through the exchange of body fluids , such as blood transfusions .
in developing countries , the use of condoms protects against other highly contagious diseases , such as hepatitis , as well . condom use to prevent spread of aids only last week cardinal carlo maria martini , the highly influential former archbishop of milan , set a precedent by making a public appeal to at least permit condom use to prevent the transmission of deadly viruses . " we need to do everything possible to combat aids .
under certain conditions , the use of condoms is necessary .
those who are afflicted have an obligation to protect the other partner , " he told the italian weekly newsmagazine l 'espresso .
at the same time , he emphasized that this was not a green light for the church to actively start distributing condoms . softening of pope 's " rottweiler " image cardinal martini , a jesuit , is considered a moderate in the conclave that elected the then former joseph ratzinger from germany as pope last year following the death of john paul ii .
ratzinger , whom critics have dubbed " god 's rottweiler , " was a protégé of the late pope .
john paul ii took hard-line positions on the role of women in the catholic church and the treatment of homosexuals , as well as the condemnation of artificial birth control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in south africa alone there are an estimated 662,000 aids orphans though many german catholics take pride that the pope is a fellow countryman , the reaction towards the pontiff has been mixed from progressive catholics .
however the easing of the church 's absolutist position on the use of artificial means of birth control suggests pope benedict xvi could bring the church more in line with social realities and reformist views . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler . "

delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .

" you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .

delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .
it 's the first time the union has agreed to make added compensation conditional on a firm 's performance . kannegiesser stressed that in agreeing the rise , the employers had gone as far as they possibly could . " it 's an appropriate result for both parties , " peters said . difficult burden but the head of germany 's employers ' association , dieter hundt , said the agreement created a " burden " that many employers would find " difficult to bear " because the pay rises were much higher than was necessary to keep employees happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall leader jürgen peters he nonetheless welcomed as " significant progress " a provision allowing flexibility in organizing employers ' work . bernd gottschalk , president of the automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- , said the agreement would not improve competition or strengthen germany 's economy . the engineering and metalworking sectors , spanning industries from cars to semi-conductors , are among the most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . the 5,000 businesses in the sector include big names such as the thyssenkrupp steel company , electronics group siemens and car makers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen . tens of thousands of metal workers took part in a series of warning strikes across the country and the union had threatened to start an indefinite general strike this week . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de metal workers join germany 's strikers as a public service strike continues into its eighth week in southern germany and on the heels of a health care sector strike , thousands of metal workers cast aside their tools on wednesday .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

" we are committed to being long-term investors in the company and our intention is to support the company and its management - particularly at the supervisory board level - in executing a strategy of long-term value creation , " said blackstone chief executive stephen schwarzman in a statement . blackstone managed some 14 billion dollars of investments across the world last year , mainly in property and corporate debt .
it also advises firms on restructuring programs . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecommunications company , is planning to invest in new technology and cut thousands of jobs to counter a fall in its traditional fixed-line business as part of its restructuring strategy . foreign investment a positive step say experts despite fears that german jobs could be at risk from the involvement of outside investors , observers feel that the move by the german government to favor blackstone is a positive one .

however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

" the impact of this case goes far beyond microsoft .
the ability to innovate is important to the success of any company and the economic success of any country , " he added . determined to see the ruling thrown out by the court , the group has enlisted a small army of lawyers which it hopes will convince the judges hearing the case that the eu competition watchdog ruling is ill founded . but the eu commission team appeared equally resolute , despite having only about half the numbers of the 60-strong microsoft force . " the commission has a very strong case , i think the strongest it 's ever had , " said lawyer thomas vinje , who represents a trade body of big microsoft rivals like adobe , ibm , realnetworks and sun microsystems . after the presiding judge , dane bo vesterdorf , opened the first session , bellis attacked the commission 's position regarding its windows media player , charging that regulators had made " fundamental errors of fact and reasoning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taming the giant , or just picking on the big guy unfairly ?
he and other experts argued that there was plenty of competition for the windows audiovisual software and that in terms of numbers it was increasing .
they cited the example of apple 's itunes , which has grown in europe . but the hearing was short on drama or rhetoric , as lawyers got down to the technical haggling which will ultimately decide the case . biggest decision ever after a five-year investigation , the european commission made its biggest competition decision ever in march 2004 when it found that microsoft had broke eu law by using a quasi monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft nearly half a billion euros , the eu ordered microsoft to sell a version of windows unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by makers of rival products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says microsoft is hurting consumer choice although microsoft reluctantly paid its half-billion-euro fine and introduced versions of windows without the player , it has failed to satisfy all of brussels ' demands to correct the situation and filed the appeal against the ruling to get it overturned . separately from the trial , the commission has threatened microsoft with fines of up to 2 million euros per day if it finds in the coming months that the company is not doing enough to meet the demands laid out in the 2004 ruling . the trial holds huge stakes for both sides because a defeat for microsoft would leave it little choice but to bow to the commission 's demands , while eu regulators could find their authority seriously compromised if they were to lose . but it will not be until the end of this year , at the very earliest , that the judges will hand down their decision , which could then be appealed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .

" the impact of this case goes far beyond microsoft .
the ability to innovate is important to the success of any company and the economic success of any country , " he added . determined to see the ruling thrown out by the court , the group has enlisted a small army of lawyers which it hopes will convince the judges hearing the case that the eu competition watchdog ruling is ill founded . but the eu commission team appeared equally resolute , despite having only about half the numbers of the 60-strong microsoft force . " the commission has a very strong case , i think the strongest it 's ever had , " said lawyer thomas vinje , who represents a trade body of big microsoft rivals like adobe , ibm , realnetworks and sun microsystems . after the presiding judge , dane bo vesterdorf , opened the first session , bellis attacked the commission 's position regarding its windows media player , charging that regulators had made " fundamental errors of fact and reasoning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taming the giant , or just picking on the big guy unfairly ?
he and other experts argued that there was plenty of competition for the windows audiovisual software and that in terms of numbers it was increasing .
they cited the example of apple 's itunes , which has grown in europe . but the hearing was short on drama or rhetoric , as lawyers got down to the technical haggling which will ultimately decide the case . biggest decision ever after a five-year investigation , the european commission made its biggest competition decision ever in march 2004 when it found that microsoft had broke eu law by using a quasi monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft nearly half a billion euros , the eu ordered microsoft to sell a version of windows unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by makers of rival products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says microsoft is hurting consumer choice although microsoft reluctantly paid its half-billion-euro fine and introduced versions of windows without the player , it has failed to satisfy all of brussels ' demands to correct the situation and filed the appeal against the ruling to get it overturned . separately from the trial , the commission has threatened microsoft with fines of up to 2 million euros per day if it finds in the coming months that the company is not doing enough to meet the demands laid out in the 2004 ruling . the trial holds huge stakes for both sides because a defeat for microsoft would leave it little choice but to bow to the commission 's demands , while eu regulators could find their authority seriously compromised if they were to lose . but it will not be until the end of this year , at the very earliest , that the judges will hand down their decision , which could then be appealed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2006 germany hopes to help india spread the light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's hopelessly tangled electricity sector is in urgent need of a fix india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .
delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .

delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market .

" you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .

" renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .

the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .

he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "

delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2006 microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's lead counsel brad smith arrives in court on monday us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels . microsoft 's lawyers on monday told a special 13-judge court that the european commission had made fundamental errors in deciding that the company illegally tied its windows media player into the windows operating system . instead , argued microsoft lawyer jean-francois bellis , consumers have benefited from an improved product and competition in the audiovisual software industry was healthy . the eu commission , executive arm of the european union , found microsoft had abused its virtual monopoly in its near ubiquitous operating system in a 2004 landmark ruling to muscle out its rivals . microsoft was fined a record 497 million euros -lrb- $ 613 million -rrb- and ordered to sell a version of windows without the window media player . microsoft has requested the trial at the european court of first instance , the 25-nation bloc 's second highest tribunal , in the hopes of recouping all or least part of the fine , which it has already paid . technical evidence despite the huge stakes for both microsoft and the european union 's competition watchdog , their respective legal teams appeared relaxed but serious as the five-day trial got underway in luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft sold copies of windows xp without the media player , but not many " we welcome the opportunity to present our evidence , " microsoft legal chief brad smith said just before the case opened .
" the impact of this case goes far beyond microsoft .
the ability to innovate is important to the success of any company and the economic success of any country , " he added . determined to see the ruling thrown out by the court , the group has enlisted a small army of lawyers which it hopes will convince the judges hearing the case that the eu competition watchdog ruling is ill founded . but the eu commission team appeared equally resolute , despite having only about half the numbers of the 60-strong microsoft force . " the commission has a very strong case , i think the strongest it 's ever had , " said lawyer thomas vinje , who represents a trade body of big microsoft rivals like adobe , ibm , realnetworks and sun microsystems . after the presiding judge , dane bo vesterdorf , opened the first session , bellis attacked the commission 's position regarding its windows media player , charging that regulators had made " fundamental errors of fact and reasoning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taming the giant , or just picking on the big guy unfairly ?
he and other experts argued that there was plenty of competition for the windows audiovisual software and that in terms of numbers it was increasing .
they cited the example of apple 's itunes , which has grown in europe . but the hearing was short on drama or rhetoric , as lawyers got down to the technical haggling which will ultimately decide the case . biggest decision ever after a five-year investigation , the european commission made its biggest competition decision ever in march 2004 when it found that microsoft had broke eu law by using a quasi monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft nearly half a billion euros , the eu ordered microsoft to sell a version of windows unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by makers of rival products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says microsoft is hurting consumer choice although microsoft reluctantly paid its half-billion-euro fine and introduced versions of windows without the player , it has failed to satisfy all of brussels ' demands to correct the situation and filed the appeal against the ruling to get it overturned . separately from the trial , the commission has threatened microsoft with fines of up to 2 million euros per day if it finds in the coming months that the company is not doing enough to meet the demands laid out in the 2004 ruling . the trial holds huge stakes for both sides because a defeat for microsoft would leave it little choice but to bow to the commission 's demands , while eu regulators could find their authority seriously compromised if they were to lose . but it will not be until the end of this year , at the very earliest , that the judges will hand down their decision , which could then be appealed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .
critics believe more should be done to boost the dramatically falling birth rate in germany rather than setting up initiatives to provide for childcare . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .

this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time .

asian champions japan came to germany in 2005 and impressed many with their showing in the confederations cup .
now brazilian legend zico hopes to coach them to further heights at the world cup . world cup qualifiers japan was the first country to qualify for the 2006 world cup , excluding germany , who are automatically in as hosts .
the team did n't lose a single point in the preliminary qualifiers and ended its campaign ahead of the rest of group b. stars hidetoshi nakata , shunsuke nakamura and shinji ono , all of whom earn their salary in european leagues , make up japan 's quick and aggressive midfield and are the men who will get the closest marks when they take the field . trainer japan 's national team takes its orders from brazil 's zico .
the long-time midfield start took over from philippe troussier in 2002 after the frenchman brought the host side past the round of 16 in the 2002 world cup .
japan saw their fortune turn around under zico , winning the 2004 asian cup and putting in a solid performance at the confederations cup in 2005 - not to mention the flawless 2006 qualification run .
now zico , and the team , will have to meet the expectations their success has brought them . world cup history including this summer 's tournament , japan have qualified for three world cup finals . 1998 preliminaries , 2002 round of 16 match schedule : preliminary round june 12 : australia - japan in kaiserslautern june 18 : japan - croatia in nuremberg june 22 : japan - brazil in dortmund world cup base japan will be staying and training in the former german capital of bonn . outlook facing off against brazil , croatia and australia , japan does n't have any easy opponents , but has a chance to move out of the preliminaries .
zico has even said he 'd rather meet the much-feared brazilian team in the group round than at a later , do-or-die , stage in the tournament , and even mentioned that the reigning world champions will probably have already qualified for the next round before meeting japan and possibly not want to tire themselves out in the final game before the round of 16 matches .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . so a black man was beaten and it is now a racist item ?
wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .
the victim needs our prayers and the suspects need jail !
end of story . - hannover only insecure people will perpetrate racism . i strongly feel racists should be punished , but they should be treated first .
they are psychologically sick .
today it is a black man .
tomorrow it may be an asian .
and who knows when it will be a bavarian or a german from the east . - gmafany germany is doing the best it can against the neo-nazis , but more psychological studies need to be conducted to find out why young people are so attracted to such a violent ideology .
you can not combat it through education or legislation alone .
there are socio-economic reasons that contribute to the violence .
we are only beginning to ask what goes on inside of the neo-nazis ' minds and need to know more about the problem in order to effectively prevent it . - j. white feather , new york , ny schönbohm 's reaction says it all : he , as well as most germans , is in complete denial about the rise of racism and xenophobia in their country .
how can he claim that it ' may not be a racist attack ' since the attackers voices are clearly heard on ermyas ' wife 's voicemail , saying ' nigger ' ? ! ? - martin sauter , bath , uk i am a canadian citizen of jamaican descent , currently residing in berlin , and therefore a visible minority .
i had never been so aware of my skin color until i moved here .
it is a sad thing when one is confronted with racism anywhere .
however in germany , with its history , it is especially tragic when the attacks are so venomous , such as the one in which the ethiopian man was practically bludgeoned to death .
i did not expect to be so boldly confronted on this issue and had no pre-conceived ideas of how racist people can be here .

wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . so a black man was beaten and it is now a racist item ?
wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .
the victim needs our prayers and the suspects need jail !
end of story . - hannover only insecure people will perpetrate racism . i strongly feel racists should be punished , but they should be treated first .
they are psychologically sick .
today it is a black man .
tomorrow it may be an asian .
and who knows when it will be a bavarian or a german from the east . - gmafany germany is doing the best it can against the neo-nazis , but more psychological studies need to be conducted to find out why young people are so attracted to such a violent ideology .
you can not combat it through education or legislation alone .
there are socio-economic reasons that contribute to the violence .
we are only beginning to ask what goes on inside of the neo-nazis ' minds and need to know more about the problem in order to effectively prevent it . - j. white feather , new york , ny schönbohm 's reaction says it all : he , as well as most germans , is in complete denial about the rise of racism and xenophobia in their country .
how can he claim that it ' may not be a racist attack ' since the attackers voices are clearly heard on ermyas ' wife 's voicemail , saying ' nigger ' ? ! ? - martin sauter , bath , uk i am a canadian citizen of jamaican descent , currently residing in berlin , and therefore a visible minority .
i had never been so aware of my skin color until i moved here .
it is a sad thing when one is confronted with racism anywhere .
however in germany , with its history , it is especially tragic when the attacks are so venomous , such as the one in which the ethiopian man was practically bludgeoned to death .
i did not expect to be so boldly confronted on this issue and had no pre-conceived ideas of how racist people can be here .
the eu should make it a priority to educate people , and abolish all groups that aim to suppress or eradicate individuals solely based on their ethnic origins . - kulawa compilied by dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

" the impact of this case goes far beyond microsoft .
the ability to innovate is important to the success of any company and the economic success of any country , " he added . determined to see the ruling thrown out by the court , the group has enlisted a small army of lawyers which it hopes will convince the judges hearing the case that the eu competition watchdog ruling is ill founded . but the eu commission team appeared equally resolute , despite having only about half the numbers of the 60-strong microsoft force . " the commission has a very strong case , i think the strongest it 's ever had , " said lawyer thomas vinje , who represents a trade body of big microsoft rivals like adobe , ibm , realnetworks and sun microsystems . after the presiding judge , dane bo vesterdorf , opened the first session , bellis attacked the commission 's position regarding its windows media player , charging that regulators had made " fundamental errors of fact and reasoning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taming the giant , or just picking on the big guy unfairly ?
he and other experts argued that there was plenty of competition for the windows audiovisual software and that in terms of numbers it was increasing .
they cited the example of apple 's itunes , which has grown in europe . but the hearing was short on drama or rhetoric , as lawyers got down to the technical haggling which will ultimately decide the case . biggest decision ever after a five-year investigation , the european commission made its biggest competition decision ever in march 2004 when it found that microsoft had broke eu law by using a quasi monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft nearly half a billion euros , the eu ordered microsoft to sell a version of windows unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by makers of rival products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says microsoft is hurting consumer choice although microsoft reluctantly paid its half-billion-euro fine and introduced versions of windows without the player , it has failed to satisfy all of brussels ' demands to correct the situation and filed the appeal against the ruling to get it overturned . separately from the trial , the commission has threatened microsoft with fines of up to 2 million euros per day if it finds in the coming months that the company is not doing enough to meet the demands laid out in the 2004 ruling . the trial holds huge stakes for both sides because a defeat for microsoft would leave it little choice but to bow to the commission 's demands , while eu regulators could find their authority seriously compromised if they were to lose . but it will not be until the end of this year , at the very earliest , that the judges will hand down their decision , which could then be appealed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 alleged racial attack becomes political issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators march in potsdam against xenophobia an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case . federal investigators appear to be getting closer to tying up many of the loose ends around the brutal easter sunday attack on an ethiopian-born german that almost killed him .
but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2006 germany hopes to help india spread the light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's hopelessly tangled electricity sector is in urgent need of a fix india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .
delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2006 germany hopes to help india spread the light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's hopelessly tangled electricity sector is in urgent need of a fix india 's acute electricity shortage , at sharp odds to its booming economy , is a focus at the hanover industrial fair this week .
delhi wants to drum up more german investment in the sector . the crisis started four years ago , remembers satish krishna ambekar .
" we started facing load-shedding for four hours daily , " said the 57-year-old entrepreneur , referring to the cutting off the electric current on certain lines when the demand becomes greater than the supply . ambekar , who runs a factory making confectionary cartons in pune , close to bombay , said the impact was ruinous : " my workers sat idle , we could n't meet our business commitments .
the production losses were catastrophic . "
like much of the manufacturing and corporate sector in india long used to the failings of the national grid , ambekar invested in setting up his own " captive " electricity generating plant in order to survive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in india live without adequate electricity supply by one estimate , peak demand in india today exceeds electricity supply by 14 percent .
the countryside , where more than two-thirds of india 's 1.2 billion people live , accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity consumption and some 40 percent of the country 's electricity supply is lost due to theft . in an expert report , the indian government reckons it would need a capacity addition of 100 gigawatts by 2012 if it is to meet an ambitious " power for all by 2012 " goal . german investment sought at hanover it may sound like an insurmountable problem , but delhi is trying to tackle it by opening up the hitherto state-owned electricity sector and inviting foreign investment .
the topic is set to be a focus at the ongoing hanover industrial fair , where india hopes to attract more german investment in its power sector during an indo-german energy symposium . " hopefully german companies will have a lot of interest , " said r.v. shahi , secretary in the indian energy ministry , speaking to journalists recently in delhi .
" the opportunities for them will be threefold : power projects , coal mines and supplying parts and machinery . " germany eyeing coal , technology transfer the indians can count on a receptive audience when they come to hanover this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian railways alone is a huge energy-guzzler " india 's hunger for energy is so huge that german firms will surely be interested in feeding it , " said achim rodewald of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai .
he pointed out that , ironically , private industry provides the most growth potential for german firms in the sector .
" companies in india just do n't have much faith in the national grid and often the quality of electricity is so poor that it routinely wrecks machinery , " said rodewald .
" that 's why so many are eager to build their own electricity-generating plants . " a few big german companies already play a prominent role in the indian electricity and power segment .
siemens technology reportedly already accounts for about 35 percent of india 's installed electricity capacity . herdan thorsten , head of the association of german machinery and plant construction -lrb- vdma -rrb- in frankfurt said that germany could play an increased role in supplying machinery for all types of power plants .
" i think the indians will be particularly interested in german technology whether it 's in turbines , compressors or pumps , " he said . and india has just confirmed it plans to talk nuclear energy with germany at the hanover fair .
nuclear energy makes up 2 percent of india 's energy supplies .
germany is in the middle of a nuclear phase-out at home . however , the coal industry , which has no big future in germany , stands to gain from india 's overtures .
coal fuels as much as 60 percent of india 's electricity needs and delhi has admitted that coal will continue to be india 's " mainstay " fuel for years to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has several coal-fired power plants " germany 's a world leader when it comes to coal-fired power plants and machines used for efficient extraction of coal .
so india 's definitely interesting , " said thorsten . germany is known for its expertise in so-called " clean coal technology . "
this could be welcome in india , since its own coal reserves are of a low quality , with a high ash content and low calorific value . rodewald added that a delegation from saarland , a coal-mining region in germany , was in india recently to sniff out opportunities . renewable energy the winner ? but , according to some , it 's germany 's renewable energy sector that stands to profit the most from india 's spiraling electricity needs . " renewable energy will inevitably become more important given high oil prices and the limited reserves of fossil fuels and india 's not going to be immune to it , " rodewald said . renewable energy currently fuels about five percent of india 's electricity . though that 's not even a fraction of what 's needed , it 's steadily on the rise - facilitated by tax breaks and other moves by the indian government to attract foreign investment in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is also catching on in india not surprisingly , those german companies who have already made the leap to india are reaping the benefits .
a company specializing in wind energy , suzlon , has even floated its shares on the stock market . " take a bet on india " some point out that there 's only one way ahead for still-hesitant german companies eyeing india 's massive electricity sector . " you have to take a bet on india , " said montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of india 's state planning commission in delhi .
" if india 's going to continue to grow at 8 percent , there 's going to be a huge demand for electricity , if it is n't , there 's no point investing in it .
that 's the key decision . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .

" they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement keeps warning strikes from turning into the full-fledged thing a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .
however , some employers have said the agreement will hurt germany 's competitiveness . speaking at the hanover trade fair on monday , dieter brucklacher , president of the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- , called the agreement a " pyrrhic victory " for the ig metall industrial union that in the long term will hurt employers by preventing job creation . " we are anything but happy , " he said . the agreement initially concerns metal workers in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , which alone has around 700,000 employed in the sector .
as is customary in wage bargaining in germany , the pilot agreement will likely be extended to the other regions .
unions in several other states have called their own wage commissions together on monday for consultations . bonuses the deal , which is valid until the end of march 2007 and has been welcomed by chancellor angela merkel , contains a 3 percent pay increase over a 10-month period which starts on june 1 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall had originally asked for a 5 percent pay increase gesamtmetall , the employers ' association for the metal and electrical industry , initially offered a 1.2 percent annual hike over two years . every worker will also get a bonus of 310 euros -lrb- $ 382 -rrb- for the months of march , april and may , according to the head of ig metall , jürgen peters , and the head of gesamtmetall , martin kannegiesser . the bonuses will vary from business to business , however .
an employer will be able to pay less than the 310 euro bonus by agreement with workers ' councils if the company 's results are bad or an increased bonus of up to 620 euros if results are good .
it 's the first time the union has agreed to make added compensation conditional on a firm 's performance . kannegiesser stressed that in agreeing the rise , the employers had gone as far as they possibly could . " it 's an appropriate result for both parties , " peters said . difficult burden but the head of germany 's employers ' association , dieter hundt , said the agreement created a " burden " that many employers would find " difficult to bear " because the pay rises were much higher than was necessary to keep employees happy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall leader jürgen peters he nonetheless welcomed as " significant progress " a provision allowing flexibility in organizing employers ' work . bernd gottschalk , president of the automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- , said the agreement would not improve competition or strengthen germany 's economy . the engineering and metalworking sectors , spanning industries from cars to semi-conductors , are among the most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . the 5,000 businesses in the sector include big names such as the thyssenkrupp steel company , electronics group siemens and car makers daimlerchrysler and volkswagen . tens of thousands of metal workers took part in a series of warning strikes across the country and the union had threatened to start an indefinite general strike this week . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de metal workers join germany 's strikers as a public service strike continues into its eighth week in southern germany and on the heels of a health care sector strike , thousands of metal workers cast aside their tools on wednesday .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- unions , employers prepare for bitter battle in wage talks employers and unions sharpened their knives for a bitter battle in upcoming sector-wide wage talks in germany , with unions calling for pay increases and employers threatening to slash jobs and move abroad .

employers , however , say it will cost jobs . the accord , which was reached on saturday morning after 10 weeks of negotiations and a final marathon session lasting 18 hours , has kept 3.4 million workers from walking off the job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany debates the family fewer european couples tying the knot german women take the rap for declining birth rate opinion : mother 's day is n't what it used to be new parenting legislation focuses on fathers germany -pipe- 24.04.2006 minister 's compulsory kindergarten year proposal draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned compulsory year hopes to improve language and social skills in children german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has stirred further debate by proposing that kindergarten attendance should be compulsory for every child in germany for at least one year before school . von der leyen 's proposed reform program for the improvement of family life in germany is under fire again after she suggested that a compulsory kindergarten year would help the children of immigrant families improve their language , social skills and assimilate easier into german schools . germany 's kindergartens are open to all children from the age of three to six with some providing care for even younger children .
attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .
critics believe more should be done to boost the dramatically falling birth rate in germany rather than setting up initiatives to provide for childcare . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

"
barragan , who is mexican , added that the vatican is preparing a document on condom use , but declined to reveal its details . opposition to artificial birth control in the past , the catholic church has steadfastly opposed all means of artificial contraception , even the use of condoms for those infected with the hiv virus .
hiv is widespread in the developing world , where the church is active on the grassroots level .

those who are afflicted have an obligation to protect the other partner , " he told the italian weekly newsmagazine l 'espresso .
at the same time , he emphasized that this was not a green light for the church to actively start distributing condoms . softening of pope 's " rottweiler " image cardinal martini , a jesuit , is considered a moderate in the conclave that elected the then former joseph ratzinger from germany as pope last year following the death of john paul ii .
ratzinger , whom critics have dubbed " god 's rottweiler , " was a protégé of the late pope .
john paul ii took hard-line positions on the role of women in the catholic church and the treatment of homosexuals , as well as the condemnation of artificial birth control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in south africa alone there are an estimated 662,000 aids orphans though many german catholics take pride that the pope is a fellow countryman , the reaction towards the pontiff has been mixed from progressive catholics .

but charges and counter-charges have been flying fiercely among politicians and interest groups as a heated debate over racism has broken out . a war of words has broken out between jörg schönbohm , the interior minister of the state of brandenburg , where potsdam is located , and germany 's top federal prosecutor , kay nehm , who is leading the investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm schönbohm has criticized nehm for sending in federal investigators to take charge of the investigation , saying it was " excessive " and gave the impression that the attack had put germany 's internal security at risk .
he has also questioned the assumption that there was a racist motive behind the attack . " -lrb- nehm -rrb- has made the thing a political issue and helped stigmatize brandenburg , " schönbohm told the sunday edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" he 's caused a considerable amount of political damage . " prosecutor shoots back that was just the latest in a series of verbal salvos between the two men .
on friday at a press conference , nehm complained in what was seen as a clear reference to schönbohm that " interior ministers ' statements are not especially helpful " to the investigation .
according to people close to nehm , brandenburg 's interior minister is " really getting on his nerves , " the newsmagazine der spiegel wrote . the attack comes at an especially sensitive time for germany , which is about to host soccer teams and fans from around the globe who will be in the country for the soccer world cup this summer .
it is likely federal prosecutors wanted to send a clear message to both germans and foreigners that solving and preventing attacks such of these are a high priority for the government . some left-leaning politicians have stepped into the fray , defending the decision to put the investigation on a federal level and criticizing schönbohm 's public doubts about the motive behind the attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german federal prosecutor kay nehm nehm made it " clear that a possible far-right , xenophobic background to the violence in potsdam will be prosecuted with all the means at the state 's disposal , " volker beck , a prominent green politician , told the internet news site netzeitung . niels annen , a member of the social democratic party 's executive committee , also expressed dismay over schönbohm 's remarks .
" we can not deny the fact that attacks on foreign citizens in germany are part of everyday life in parts of our country , " he said , adding that nehm had sent out an important political signal by taking on the case . germany 's central council of jews also weighed in , saying if schönbohm did n't recognize that there were racist motives behind the attack , " he desperately needs some private tutoring . " racist motive ? whether the 37-year-old ethiopian-german , only identified in the media as ermyas m. , was the victim of racists was questioned in an article in the märkische allgemeine newspaper .
according to the paper , an eyewitness has said the victim provoked his attackers , calling one of them a " pig " and trying to kick him .
all three men involved in the incident are reported to have been drunk at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighbors and friends of german-ethiopian ermyas m. gather next to the scene of the attack the paper also reported that contrary to some previous accounts , the victim suffered no broken ribs or other wounds on his upper body .
that could indicate that the attackers left the scene after one punch to the face which damaged ermyas m. 's eye . however , a recording of the incident on the voicemail box of the victim 's wife supports the theory that race played a role .
the attackers are heard using racist language in threatening the ethiopian-german , who has shown some improvement but is still in a coma more than one week after the attack . federal minister in the fray germany 's federal interior minister wolfgang schäuble has also been roundly criticized for remarks he made in the case .
like schönbohm , he also cast doubt on a racist motive , saying that " blond , blue-eyed people are also victims of violence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister of interior wolfgang schäuble on sunday evening , schäuble distanced himself from his remarks .
" i did n't need to describe -lrb- the situation -rrb- with those two terms , " he said in a television interview , adding : " we must fight with determination every form of extremism , violence and xenophobia . " schäuble also backpedaled from previous statements that seemed to indicate racism in eastern germany was a problem that could be traced back to the gdr era .
he had earlier said east germans had had little experience with foreigners due to the closed nature of gdr society . on sunday , the interior minister was quick to qualify his remarks , saying he did not mean that former gdr citizens were more prone to exercise violence against foreigners than others . whoever accused him of such an attitude was " shameless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two held in racist attack two men accused of a brutal racist attack on a german citizen of ethiopian origin were remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder by a federal court judge friday .

" the impact of this case goes far beyond microsoft .
the ability to innovate is important to the success of any company and the economic success of any country , " he added . determined to see the ruling thrown out by the court , the group has enlisted a small army of lawyers which it hopes will convince the judges hearing the case that the eu competition watchdog ruling is ill founded . but the eu commission team appeared equally resolute , despite having only about half the numbers of the 60-strong microsoft force . " the commission has a very strong case , i think the strongest it 's ever had , " said lawyer thomas vinje , who represents a trade body of big microsoft rivals like adobe , ibm , realnetworks and sun microsystems . after the presiding judge , dane bo vesterdorf , opened the first session , bellis attacked the commission 's position regarding its windows media player , charging that regulators had made " fundamental errors of fact and reasoning .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . so a black man was beaten and it is now a racist item ?
wrong !
a man was beaten and it was a crime .
ca n't we get off this racist tag for everything and just call a crime a crime ?
it makes no difference if you 're black , white , red or yellow ; if a crime is committed against you it hurts no matter what your skin color .
the victim needs our prayers and the suspects need jail !
end of story . - hannover only insecure people will perpetrate racism . i strongly feel racists should be punished , but they should be treated first .
they are psychologically sick .
today it is a black man .
tomorrow it may be an asian .
and who knows when it will be a bavarian or a german from the east . - gmafany germany is doing the best it can against the neo-nazis , but more psychological studies need to be conducted to find out why young people are so attracted to such a violent ideology .
you can not combat it through education or legislation alone .
there are socio-economic reasons that contribute to the violence .
we are only beginning to ask what goes on inside of the neo-nazis ' minds and need to know more about the problem in order to effectively prevent it . - j. white feather , new york , ny schönbohm 's reaction says it all : he , as well as most germans , is in complete denial about the rise of racism and xenophobia in their country .
how can he claim that it ' may not be a racist attack ' since the attackers voices are clearly heard on ermyas ' wife 's voicemail , saying ' nigger ' ? ! ? - martin sauter , bath , uk i am a canadian citizen of jamaican descent , currently residing in berlin , and therefore a visible minority .
i had never been so aware of my skin color until i moved here .
it is a sad thing when one is confronted with racism anywhere .
however in germany , with its history , it is especially tragic when the attacks are so venomous , such as the one in which the ethiopian man was practically bludgeoned to death .
i did not expect to be so boldly confronted on this issue and had no pre-conceived ideas of how racist people can be here .
the eu should make it a priority to educate people , and abolish all groups that aim to suppress or eradicate individuals solely based on their ethnic origins . - kulawa compilied by dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

" we are committed to being long-term investors in the company and our intention is to support the company and its management - particularly at the supervisory board level - in executing a strategy of long-term value creation , " said blackstone chief executive stephen schwarzman in a statement . blackstone managed some 14 billion dollars of investments across the world last year , mainly in property and corporate debt .
it also advises firms on restructuring programs . deutsche telekom , europe 's largest telecommunications company , is planning to invest in new technology and cut thousands of jobs to counter a fall in its traditional fixed-line business as part of its restructuring strategy . foreign investment a positive step say experts despite fears that german jobs could be at risk from the involvement of outside investors , observers feel that the move by the german government to favor blackstone is a positive one . " the german government is clearly working with private equity to attract foreign capital .

former stasi victims are outraged . for some of the 300 people at a march meeting about changes to a former stasi prison in berlin , old and terrifying memories were suddenly relived as they found themselves unexpectedly face to face with their one-time tormentors .
the purpose of the gathering was a discussion of planned information plaques and a speaker at the podium was describing the facility in berlin 's eastern hohenschönhausen district as a " place of terror , mistreatment and suffering " when catcalls erupted in the audience .
shouts of " lies " went up and several people demanded the former prison and interrogation center , now a museum and memorial to its victims , be closed .
it turns out than 200 of the audience members were former generals , officers and employees of the now-defunct ministry for state security , or stasi , east germany 's secret police and intelligence service .
the group was led by no less than a former deputy of stasi head erich mielke himself , werner grossmann , and another high-ranking officer and former deputy , wolfgang schwanitz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former hq of the stasi in berlin the former head of the prison , siegfried rataizik , scolded the former prisoners in attendance , saying " you present yourselves as victims and declare us the perpetrators " when , he added in statement that most historians would dispute , everyone held in the facility had been treated humanely .
" many -lrb- former prisoners -rrb- have the feeling that they are being punished a second time when things like this happen , " said hubertus knabe , the musuem 's director .
" it rips open a lot of wounds . "
going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .
" they 're doing nothing less than fighting for approval , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

"
barragan , who is mexican , added that the vatican is preparing a document on condom use , but declined to reveal its details . opposition to artificial birth control in the past , the catholic church has steadfastly opposed all means of artificial contraception , even the use of condoms for those infected with the hiv virus .
hiv is widespread in the developing world , where the church is active on the grassroots level .
it has always maintained the position that birth control should be exercised by abstinence or natural means , such as the rhythm method , which has been mocked by critics as " vatican roulette . " bildunterschrift : cardinal carlo maria martini spoke out on condom use to halt the spread of aids up to now , the church had also condemned the use of condoms for married couples , even when one of them is infected with the aids virus .
hiv can be spread not only through sexual contact , but through the exchange of body fluids , such as blood transfusions .
in developing countries , the use of condoms protects against other highly contagious diseases , such as hepatitis , as well . condom use to prevent spread of aids only last week cardinal carlo maria martini , the highly influential former archbishop of milan , set a precedent by making a public appeal to at least permit condom use to prevent the transmission of deadly viruses . " we need to do everything possible to combat aids .
under certain conditions , the use of condoms is necessary .
those who are afflicted have an obligation to protect the other partner , " he told the italian weekly newsmagazine l 'espresso .
at the same time , he emphasized that this was not a green light for the church to actively start distributing condoms . softening of pope 's " rottweiler " image cardinal martini , a jesuit , is considered a moderate in the conclave that elected the then former joseph ratzinger from germany as pope last year following the death of john paul ii .
ratzinger , whom critics have dubbed " god 's rottweiler , " was a protégé of the late pope .
john paul ii took hard-line positions on the role of women in the catholic church and the treatment of homosexuals , as well as the condemnation of artificial birth control . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in south africa alone there are an estimated 662,000 aids orphans though many german catholics take pride that the pope is a fellow countryman , the reaction towards the pontiff has been mixed from progressive catholics .
however the easing of the church 's absolutist position on the use of artificial means of birth control suggests pope benedict xvi could bring the church more in line with social realities and reformist views . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

going public former victims of the stasi , and there are many , are finding those old wounds increasingly raw these days as ex-stasi officers take their arguments ­ that their former organization was a regular secret service just like any other . " they are unrepentant , almost all of them , and they 've become louder lately , " said klaus schroeder , head of a team which researches the east german regime at berlin 's free university .
" they want to rehabilitate themselves in the public eye and save their biographies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter pfütze , left , and gotthold von schramm have written books which present a different version of the stasi earlier this month , two former stasi officers released books that presented what many say is a whitewashed version of history .
the two authors presented east germany as a country that followed the rule of law and operated within the framework of its own constitution .
one of the books , which contains accounts from former stasi employers , is described by the publisher as " exciting , " " funny " and " enlightening . "
they are engaging in increasingly aggressive propaganda , disturbing gatherings and are getting organized , " said marianne birthler , head of the commission which administers the former ministry 's files , in an interview .
" this is alarming , because the sed dictatorship was not harmless , " she added , referring to socialist party which ruled the country with an iron fist .
" creeping rehabilitation " according to memorial director knabe , it was not always like this .
in the early 1990s , he said that ex-stasi officers would sometimes visit the former prison , even talking about their activities there .
but today , the only former state security visitors the site gets are those who insist the organization was not as bad as it is painted to be .
he calls it a " creeping rehabilitation " of their reputation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miles of incriminating stasi files are still being sifted through " since the german government has treated them so well , even raising their pension levels several times and allowing a former employee to sit in parliament , they apparently think the time is right to rewrite history , " he said .
he and others also worry about the influence that the new versions of history could have on young people , who could be susceptible to claims that stasi employees were just doing their jobs , for the good of the nation .
" they want to influence the younger generation , " said bernd stichler , head of the association of the victims of stalinism , who himself was put in jail on three occasions by the stasi .
" they 've had some success , because many young people do n't know much about the history of the east german regime . "
softening of attitudes popular culture and the media have also played a role in preparing the way for ex-stasi employees to begin work on rehabilitation .
movies showing east germany through a nostalgic lens , such as " sonnenallee " -lrb- 1999 -rrb- or " goodbye , lenin ! " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , were box office hits and the first introductions for many young people to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabant cars are a symbol of east germany and remembered fondly by many around the same time , a wave of nostalgia for the gdr , called ostalgie in german , swept the country , featuring numerous television specials that took a fond look back at aspects of life behind the iron curtain .
the subject of the stasi , however , was generally avoided .
" immediately after the fall of the wall , the gdr was seen much more critically by east germans , " said the free university 's schroeder .
" but after the nostalgia wave took off in the mid 1990s , the focus has been on east germany as a model social welfare state , not as a dictatorship . "
that softening of attitudes , he adds , has made it easier for ex-stasi officers , who disappeared into retirement or other careers after the fall of the berlin wall , to resurface and make their controversial claims loud and clear .

attendance at a kindergarten is not compulsory at the moment but most german children spend at least two years in the system before starting school .
the state provides the kindergartens and helps those families on social benefits to send their kids there while employed parents pay a fee in relation to how much they earn . the problem , according to supporters of the compulsory year , is that mainly immigrant families decide against sending their children to kindergartens , relying on older children in the family and community to support and nurture the younger ones before they are of school age .
the argument against this centers on the lack of language skills and cultural awareness that many children of immigrants face when attending a german school for the first time . " i believe that it is very important for foreign children to go to kindergarten before they enroll in a school , " von der leyen said in an interview in weekend tabloid bild am sonntag .
" it improves linguistic knowledge and gives a grounding in group behavior . " family affairs minister cut adrift by conservative colleagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen can not rely on the support she expected however , the christian union minister faces opposition to her proposal as the decision lies in the hands of the individual federal states .
despite von der leyen 's assertion that " we are all united in the idea that all children should attend kindergarten , " many ministers - mostly from her own conservative party - have voiced their opposition . fellow conservative dieter althaus , the state premier of thuringia , rebuffed the idea .
" we see no need for action , " he told the bild am sonntag .
" we have attendance of around 97 percent of children in the third year of kindergarten . " his counterpart in north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttger agreed : " there is generally no need to introduce a compulsory kindergarten year . "
this view was also shared by schleswig-holstein prime minister peter harry carstensen who said that the argument of a compulsory year was " not compelling at the moment " as 96 percent of all children visited a kindergarten for at least a year in his state . social democrat premier harald ringstorff said that the issue would not even be discussed in his state of mecklenburg-west pomerania . negative responses also came from the ministers of bavaria , berlin , brandenburg , bremen , hamburg , rhineland-palatinate , saarland and saxony . state leaders see little need for compulsory year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most states boast a high percentage of attendance christian wulff , the conservative prime minister in lower saxony , said that his state would be making it easier for children to attend kindergarten by abolishing parental responsibility for paying for the third year of kindergarten in an attempt to get the state 's figures up to 100 percent but would not be introducing a compulsory year . the only minister who came out in favor of the plan was günther oettinger , the conservative premier of baden-württemberg who said : " compulsory kindergarten attendance in the last year before school enrolment makes sense .
thus we can make sure we can prepare all children in the last phase before school begins . " christian values and childcare plans under fire von der leyen has come under fire for a number of proposals of late including what many see as her " crusade " to promote christian values in schools by involving the roman catholic and lutheran churches to participate in her " alliance for upbringing " initiative .
the idea has angered jewish and muslim groups which say that the exclusion of other faiths in the development of guidelines on raising children is " hurtful . " another proposal , to encourage fathers to take a more active role in childcare in a bid to make having children more attractive to working mothers , has also been criticized for being misplaced .
critics believe more should be done to boost the dramatically falling birth rate in germany rather than setting up initiatives to provide for childcare . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

the election of snyder rini as prime minister last tuesday triggered riots over claims that either china or taiwan had paid lawmakers to vote for him .
many chinese businesses were looted during the violence , and parts of the capital honiara were left in ruins .
hundreds of ethnic chinese have since left the country .
ahead of monday 's session , heavily-armed police and military guarded the roads leading to the parliament building .
many were from australia , new zealand and fiji - which have all sent reinforcements to the solomons in an effort to quell the rioting .
there were fears that the meeting - in which the 50 lawmakers who won their seats in parliamentary elections on 5 april were to be sworn in - would spark further violence .
solomon island police commissioner shane castles told reporters before the session began that " parliament house will be locked down , and people will not be allowed within a stone 's throwing distance " .
in the event , the swearing-in ceremony took place uninterrupted , although an opposition lawmaker , charles dausabea , was detained as he left parliament .
mr dausabea was arrested for " intimidation , " police said .
it is not clear what charges he faces , but police say they have evidence that some politicians were involved in the unrest .
mr dausabea is the third opposition mp to be arrested in the wake of the riots .
bribery claims the violence was sparked by the appointment of former deputy prime minister mr rini as the country 's new prime minister .
mr rini has already faced accusations that he is too closely linked to former prime minister allan kemakeza 's administration , which was tainted by corruption allegations .
opponents also claim he used money from chinese and taiwanese backers to bribe mps into voting for him .
mr rini has denied the claims , and challenged those making the allegations " to take the evidence to the police " .

the election of snyder rini as prime minister last tuesday triggered riots over claims that either china or taiwan had paid lawmakers to vote for him .
many chinese businesses were looted during the violence , and parts of the capital honiara were left in ruins .
hundreds of ethnic chinese have since left the country .
ahead of monday 's session , heavily-armed police and military guarded the roads leading to the parliament building .
many were from australia , new zealand and fiji - which have all sent reinforcements to the solomons in an effort to quell the rioting .
there were fears that the meeting - in which the 50 lawmakers who won their seats in parliamentary elections on 5 april were to be sworn in - would spark further violence .
solomon island police commissioner shane castles told reporters before the session began that " parliament house will be locked down , and people will not be allowed within a stone 's throwing distance " .

he added : " the view is that a major change to our service now , giving the potential for reinvestment , would be much better than gradual reductions to the service over a number of years , which would not give any chance to reinvest at all .
" painful though some of the changes will be in the short-term , we believe that a realistic , if radical , approach now would be less disruptive to the services , customers and staff in the long run . "
if the closures are given the go ahead by the council 's cabinet on 12 july , the existing mobile library service will be extended .

he describes how the authorities responded and reflects on the lessons from the disaster . "
i received a call at 0500 on 26 april 1986 , informing me that a major accident , followed by a fire , had just occurred in the fourth block of the chernobyl nuclear power station , but that the reactor was still intact .
in those early hours , until the evening of 26 april , we had not yet realised that the reactor had actually exploded and that there had been a huge discharge of radioactive materials into the atmosphere .
nobody had any idea that we were facing a major nuclear disaster .
naturally , we can regret , today , after the fact , that we did not grasp everything more quickly .
-lsb- at the time -rsb- , i was astounded : how was such a thing possible ?
nuclear scientists had always assured the country 's leadership that our nuclear reactors were completely safe .
' not panicking ' immediately after the accident , the management of the station gave the order to flood the reactor with water , because they were not aware that the reactor had exploded and there was nothing left to extinguish .
finally , the pool under the reactor and some underground locations were filled up with water .
scientists were afraid that if the hot mass of nuclear fuel and graphite were to rupture the bottom of the reactor 's tank and fall into radioactive water , this would create the conditions for a further nuclear explosion .
we were not panicking ... but we urgently needed to pump out this water .
this was completed at the beginning of may .
in this way , such an explosion , however slight its probability , was effectively prevented .
there were other threats that needed to be eliminated with the utmost urgency . "
in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation " firstly , there remained the danger that the mass at the heart of the reactor would rupture its tank and even blast through the foundations of the building housing the reactor , so coming into contact with the soil and leading to a major contamination of groundwater .
we also had to prevent the radioactive waste and debris from around the plant from contaminating the waters of the dnieper and desna rivers .
this required operations on a massive scale ...
but , of course , our main concern was to evacuate the population from the most contaminated areas .
on 27 april we performed an exemplary operation : in just three hours the entire population of pripyat , located very close to the power station , was evacuated .
and in the early days of may , we evacuated everybody living within a 30km radius of the power station , in dozens of localities : a total of 116,000 people .
told the truth ?
quite simply , in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation . "
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants " we needed several weeks to obtain precise evaluations and to draw up maps of the contamination .
certainly , i will not exclude the possibility that certain functionaries , who were afraid of being accused of not having taken the correct measures , had a tendency to embellish their reports .
but , for the most part , i believe that i was kept informed in good faith by my representatives .
we did not cancel the may day parades -lsb- in kiev and minsk -rsb- because we still did not have information on the full extent of the disaster .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants .
i admit that it was a grave mistake .
we published the first information on the accident on 28 april , in pravda , but to speak to the people , i needed a more substantial and precise analysis .
that is why i waited almost three weeks before speaking on television .
correct response ?
nowadays , experts think that our fears over the possible contamination of groundwater were exaggerated , and that it was not worth the trouble of installing a " cushion " -lsb- concrete slab -rsb- underneath the reactor . "
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past " the construction of the sarcophagus , all the measures for aquatic protection , most of the measures aimed at decontamination - these were good decisions , even though some of the deactivation did ultimately prove to be superfluous .
we decontaminated areas which were later evacuated .
nobody knew , for instance , that pripyat , that beautiful modern city , would find itself forever uninhabitable .
at first , scientists thought that the population of pripyat would be able to return to the city around the end of may or beginning of june .
people left leaving their fridges full of food , without even unplugging them , since they expected to return quickly .
environmental cost the explosion at chernobyl showed that we are capable of contaminating the planet for the long term , and of leaving a terrible legacy for future generations .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past .
chernobyl clearly demonstrated that each disaster is unique and that no country can be prepared for every eventuality .
that is why we must deploy the maximum amount of effort to prevent disasters .
one must not compromise on nuclear safety .
the social , ecological and economic consequences of these kind of disasters are much too heavy in every sense of the word .
we can therefore see what enormous responsibility is placed not only on politicians , but on scientists , engineers and designers - their mistakes could cost the life and health of millions of people .
the victims of chernobyl continue to suffer both physically and mentally .
it is our moral duty to help them while continuing to limit the ecological consequences of this disaster . "
mikhail gorbachev was interviewed by green cross international , a non-governmental organisation he founded in the wake of chernobyl .
a fuller version is appearing in the latest issue of the optimist magazine .
how culpable was the soviet leadership for the chernobyl disaster ?
what do you think of mr gorbachev 's analysis of the dangers facing today 's world ?
name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .
your comments may be published on any bbc media worldwide .
terms & conditions it is clear in gorbachev 's admitting that reports were " embellished " that the soviet system of lies , deceit and propaganda helped to allow time to elapse that could have saved more lives and environmental damage .
he is aware through hindsight being involved directly in the disaster how dangerous , and uncontrollable nuclear power out of control can be .
nobody could have caused more damage to russia than the russians themselves .
today 's world has many countries holding nuclear weapons which is of course far more of a threat than the usa - ussr standoff of the past .
cat miller , melbourne , australia i am convinced that mr. m. gorbatschev had good intention of solving the problem scientifically and quietly , with least damage to the environment and populations , however , the soviet scientists were in a bind : 1 -rrb- never before having experienced such a catastrophe , and not being able to seek advise from abroad , were confused and afraid for a reprisal by the notorious kgb , 2 -rrb- all decision were made in moscow , they waited for a directives from the top , 3 -rrb- silence , was the motto of the former ussr government .
i had the pleasure of speaking with several scientists from the ukrainian academy of science , after the collapse of the soviet union , and they affirmed my suspicion .
in 1990 , i organized scientific conference on environmental disasters , primarily ecological , and several distinguished scientists from ukraine attended the conference and presented papers on the subject , and we learned a lot from their presentations , known as " the first-hand experience " .
i am also convinced that the ukrainian scientists have and know more about the disaster , that they are willing to share with us .
let 's hope that it will never happened again .
dr.j.g. kurys , toronto , ontario , canada i had a lot of respect for gorbachev until i read this interview .
i can not understand how he could have waited for 3 weeks before telling his own people they were being killed .
michal kirejczyk , toronto , canada i think mr. gorbachev is very accurate in his assessment of the dangers we all must face .
he is being forthright in his analysis and the governments of the world should take is experience seriously .
patricia ross eastman , st paul mn usa for the disaster itself the soviet leadership can not be held responsible directly , but for the slow informing or covering up they can be blamed .
i think mr gorbachev is right in stating that we should n't compromise on nuclear safety .
hope to be able to find a copy of the optimist magazine for the complete interview .
dick vestdijk , netherlands like all disasters , we always come up with the answers from hindsight .
i think that mr.gorbachev acted in good faith without being informed of the full nature of the disaster .
however , his administration and top scientists should be held accountable for an improper analysis of the gravity of the situation and failure to act decisively and rapidly to minimise casualties .
in this instance he should have taken the welfare and safety of his people first .
in any major accident at any nuclear power plant it must be dealt with as if the threat is serious , later on , if it proves otherwise , the people in charge can justify the over reaction by simply stating that human safety was paramount .
mr gorbachev 's analysis of the nuclear dangers facing today 's world is prophetic , and i wish that certain other leaders will take a hint from him .
and as he stated we have a moral duty to help the victims .
patanjali ramlall , miami , florida , usa ultimately , the real cause was the chase for economic conditions like the western world ; fostered by the western world 's ever-increasing economic rush itself , which is not perceived as being unsustainable -lrb- to put it at it 's mildest and kindest -rrb- .
as for the analysis : stark but inadequate .
only when terrorists create pripyat conditions in a western city , or there is another nuclear war -lrb- hopefully between smaller nations and not superpowers -rrb- , will people begin to see the nuclear conundrum in a better perspective. philip gray , torun , poland i 'm most interested by mr. gorbachev 's comment , " i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants . "
in both the -lrb- former -rrb- soviet union and in china , a reflexive fear of " panic " -lrb- or uprisings -rrb- seems at times to prevent clear thinking among the leadership .
compare this with the similar - but not identical - fear of bad publicity or political consequences which too often paralyzes leaders in the u.s. and in european countries .
ralph dratman , cherry hill , nj , usa mr. gorbachev was -lrb- and is -rrb- in the unfortunate position of culpability for responsibilities which were not directly his .
from all accounts , the accident , misinformation , and subsequent mistakes such as the intentional flooding of the reactor which resulted from this misinformation , resulted from mistakes made by bureaucrats and technicians who were directly responsible on the site itself .
one could correctly state that the bureaucratic culture which allowed these initial exaggerations and cover-ups was created by , and was the responsibility of gorbachev and the rest of the soviet state .
also , it is the responsibility of leadership to assume blame for the appointing of the men and women responsible for the accident .
mr. gorbachev can rightly take credit for ordering helpful actions -lrb- such as the mass evacuations and the construction of the sarcophagus -rrb- which took place after the fact .
it is disturbing , however , to note that some 20 years after the accident , the chernobyl site has still not been permanently cleaned up .
david hilbert , ann arbor , usa gorbachev is right for the wrong reasons .
the earth now has the responsibility for radioactive waste storage and for nuclear weapons which can destroy life on this planet .
the engineering was easy , but politics is not , and the political world now has the bigger problem of controlling nuclear waste and weapons .

nobody had any idea that we were facing a major nuclear disaster .
naturally , we can regret , today , after the fact , that we did not grasp everything more quickly .
-lsb- at the time -rsb- , i was astounded : how was such a thing possible ?
nuclear scientists had always assured the country 's leadership that our nuclear reactors were completely safe .
' not panicking ' immediately after the accident , the management of the station gave the order to flood the reactor with water , because they were not aware that the reactor had exploded and there was nothing left to extinguish .
finally , the pool under the reactor and some underground locations were filled up with water .
scientists were afraid that if the hot mass of nuclear fuel and graphite were to rupture the bottom of the reactor 's tank and fall into radioactive water , this would create the conditions for a further nuclear explosion .
we were not panicking ... but we urgently needed to pump out this water .
this was completed at the beginning of may .
in this way , such an explosion , however slight its probability , was effectively prevented .
there were other threats that needed to be eliminated with the utmost urgency .
in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation firstly , there remained the danger that the mass at the heart of the reactor would rupture its tank and even blast through the foundations of the building housing the reactor , so coming into contact with the soil and leading to a major contamination of groundwater .
we also had to prevent the radioactive waste and debris from around the plant from contaminating the waters of the dnieper and desna rivers .
this required operations on a massive scale ...
but , of course , our main concern was to evacuate the population from the most contaminated areas .
on 27 april we performed an exemplary operation : in just three hours the entire population of pripyat , located very close to the power station , was evacuated .
and in the early days of may , we evacuated everybody living within a 30km radius of the power station , in dozens of localities : a total of 116,000 people .
told the truth ?
quite simply , in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants we needed several weeks to obtain precise evaluations and to draw up maps of the contamination .
certainly , i will not exclude the possibility that certain functionaries , who were afraid of being accused of not having taken the correct measures , had a tendency to embellish their reports .
but , for the most part , i believe that i was kept informed in good faith by my representatives .
we did not cancel the may day parades -lsb- in kiev and minsk -rsb- because we still did not have information on the full extent of the disaster .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants .
i admit that it was a grave mistake .
we published the first information on the accident on 28 april , in pravda , but to speak to the people , i needed a more substantial and precise analysis .
that is why i waited almost three weeks before speaking on television .
correct response ?
nowadays , experts think that our fears over the possible contamination of groundwater were exaggerated , and that it was not worth the trouble of installing a " cushion " -lsb- concrete slab -rsb- underneath the reactor .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past the construction of the sarcophagus , all the measures for aquatic protection , most of the measures aimed at decontamination - these were good decisions , even though some of the deactivation did ultimately prove to be superfluous .
we decontaminated areas which were later evacuated .
nobody knew , for instance , that pripyat , that beautiful modern city , would find itself forever uninhabitable .
at first , scientists thought that the population of pripyat would be able to return to the city around the end of may or beginning of june .
people left leaving their fridges full of food , without even unplugging them , since they expected to return quickly .
environmental cost the explosion at chernobyl showed that we are capable of contaminating the planet for the long term , and of leaving a terrible legacy for future generations .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past .
chernobyl clearly demonstrated that each disaster is unique and that no country can be prepared for every eventuality .
that is why we must deploy the maximum amount of effort to prevent disasters .
one must not compromise on nuclear safety .
the social , ecological and economic consequences of these kind of disasters are much too heavy in every sense of the word .
we can therefore see what enormous responsibility is placed not only on politicians , but on scientists , engineers and designers - their mistakes could cost the life and health of millions of people .
the victims of chernobyl continue to suffer both physically and mentally .
it is our moral duty to help them while continuing to limit the ecological consequences of this disaster .
mikhail gorbachev was interviewed by green cross international , a non-governmental organisation he founded in the wake of chernobyl .
a fuller version is appearing in the latest issue of the optimist magazine .
how culpable was the soviet leadership for the chernobyl disaster ?
what do you think of mr gorbachev 's analysis of the dangers facing today 's world ?
name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .
your comments may be published on any bbc media worldwide .
terms & conditions it is clear in gorbachev 's admitting that reports were " embellished " that the soviet system of lies , deceit and propaganda helped to allow time to elapse that could have saved more lives and environmental damage .
he is aware through hindsight being involved directly in the disaster how dangerous , and uncontrollable nuclear power out of control can be .
nobody could have caused more damage to russia than the russians themselves .
today 's world has many countries holding nuclear weapons which is of course far more of a threat than the usa - ussr standoff of the past .
cat miller , melbourne , australia i am convinced that mr. m. gorbatschev had good intention of solving the problem scientifically and quietly , with least damage to the environment and populations , however , the soviet scientists were in a bind : 1 -rrb- never before having experienced such a catastrophe , and not being able to seek advise from abroad , were confused and afraid for a reprisal by the notorious kgb , 2 -rrb- all decision were made in moscow , they waited for a directives from the top , 3 -rrb- silence , was the motto of the former ussr government .
i had the pleasure of speaking with several scientists from the ukrainian academy of science , after the collapse of the soviet union , and they affirmed my suspicion .
in 1990 , i organized scientific conference on environmental disasters , primarily ecological , and several distinguished scientists from ukraine attended the conference and presented papers on the subject , and we learned a lot from their presentations , known as " the first-hand experience " .
i am also convinced that the ukrainian scientists have and know more about the disaster , that they are willing to share with us .
let 's hope that it will never happened again .
dr.j.g. kurys , toronto , ontario , canada i had a lot of respect for gorbachev until i read this interview .
i can not understand how he could have waited for 3 weeks before telling his own people they were being killed .
michal kirejczyk , toronto , canada i think mr. gorbachev is very accurate in his assessment of the dangers we all must face .
he is being forthright in his analysis and the governments of the world should take is experience seriously .
patricia ross eastman , st paul mn usa for the disaster itself the soviet leadership can not be held responsible directly , but for the slow informing or covering up they can be blamed .
i think mr gorbachev is right in stating that we should n't compromise on nuclear safety .
hope to be able to find a copy of the optimist magazine for the complete interview .
dick vestdijk , netherlands like all disasters , we always come up with the answers from hindsight .
i think that mr.gorbachev acted in good faith without being informed of the full nature of the disaster .
however , his administration and top scientists should be held accountable for an improper analysis of the gravity of the situation and failure to act decisively and rapidly to minimise casualties .
in this instance he should have taken the welfare and safety of his people first .
in any major accident at any nuclear power plant it must be dealt with as if the threat is serious , later on , if it proves otherwise , the people in charge can justify the over reaction by simply stating that human safety was paramount .
mr gorbachev 's analysis of the nuclear dangers facing today 's world is prophetic , and i wish that certain other leaders will take a hint from him .
and as he stated we have a moral duty to help the victims .
patanjali ramlall , miami , florida , usa ultimately , the real cause was the chase for economic conditions like the western world ; fostered by the western world 's ever-increasing economic rush itself , which is not perceived as being unsustainable -lrb- to put it at it 's mildest and kindest -rrb- .
as for the analysis : stark but inadequate .
only when terrorists create pripyat conditions in a western city , or there is another nuclear war -lrb- hopefully between smaller nations and not superpowers -rrb- , will people begin to see the nuclear conundrum in a better perspective. philip gray , torun , poland i 'm most interested by mr. gorbachev 's comment , " i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants . "
in both the -lrb- former -rrb- soviet union and in china , a reflexive fear of " panic " -lrb- or uprisings -rrb- seems at times to prevent clear thinking among the leadership .
compare this with the similar - but not identical - fear of bad publicity or political consequences which too often paralyzes leaders in the u.s. and in european countries .
ralph dratman , cherry hill , nj , usa mr. gorbachev was -lrb- and is -rrb- in the unfortunate position of culpability for responsibilities which were not directly his .
from all accounts , the accident , misinformation , and subsequent mistakes such as the intentional flooding of the reactor which resulted from this misinformation , resulted from mistakes made by bureaucrats and technicians who were directly responsible on the site itself .
one could correctly state that the bureaucratic culture which allowed these initial exaggerations and cover-ups was created by , and was the responsibility of gorbachev and the rest of the soviet state .
also , it is the responsibility of leadership to assume blame for the appointing of the men and women responsible for the accident .
mr. gorbachev can rightly take credit for ordering helpful actions -lrb- such as the mass evacuations and the construction of the sarcophagus -rrb- which took place after the fact .
it is disturbing , however , to note that some 20 years after the accident , the chernobyl site has still not been permanently cleaned up .
david hilbert , ann arbor , usa gorbachev is right for the wrong reasons .
the earth now has the responsibility for radioactive waste storage and for nuclear weapons which can destroy life on this planet .
the engineering was easy , but politics is not , and the political world now has the bigger problem of controlling nuclear waste and weapons .

he describes how the authorities responded and reflects on the lessons from the disaster .
i received a call at 0500 on 26 april 1986 , informing me that a major accident , followed by a fire , had just occurred in the fourth block of the chernobyl nuclear power station , but that the reactor was still intact .
in those early hours , until the evening of 26 april , we had not yet realised that the reactor had actually exploded and that there had been a huge discharge of radioactive materials into the atmosphere .
nobody had any idea that we were facing a major nuclear disaster .
naturally , we can regret , today , after the fact , that we did not grasp everything more quickly .
-lsb- at the time -rsb- , i was astounded : how was such a thing possible ?
nuclear scientists had always assured the country 's leadership that our nuclear reactors were completely safe .
' not panicking ' immediately after the accident , the management of the station gave the order to flood the reactor with water , because they were not aware that the reactor had exploded and there was nothing left to extinguish .
finally , the pool under the reactor and some underground locations were filled up with water .
scientists were afraid that if the hot mass of nuclear fuel and graphite were to rupture the bottom of the reactor 's tank and fall into radioactive water , this would create the conditions for a further nuclear explosion .
we were not panicking ... but we urgently needed to pump out this water .
this was completed at the beginning of may .
in this way , such an explosion , however slight its probability , was effectively prevented .
there were other threats that needed to be eliminated with the utmost urgency .
in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation firstly , there remained the danger that the mass at the heart of the reactor would rupture its tank and even blast through the foundations of the building housing the reactor , so coming into contact with the soil and leading to a major contamination of groundwater .
we also had to prevent the radioactive waste and debris from around the plant from contaminating the waters of the dnieper and desna rivers .
this required operations on a massive scale ...
but , of course , our main concern was to evacuate the population from the most contaminated areas .
on 27 april we performed an exemplary operation : in just three hours the entire population of pripyat , located very close to the power station , was evacuated .
and in the early days of may , we evacuated everybody living within a 30km radius of the power station , in dozens of localities : a total of 116,000 people .
told the truth ?
quite simply , in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants we needed several weeks to obtain precise evaluations and to draw up maps of the contamination .
certainly , i will not exclude the possibility that certain functionaries , who were afraid of being accused of not having taken the correct measures , had a tendency to embellish their reports .
but , for the most part , i believe that i was kept informed in good faith by my representatives .
we did not cancel the may day parades -lsb- in kiev and minsk -rsb- because we still did not have information on the full extent of the disaster .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants .
i admit that it was a grave mistake .
we published the first information on the accident on 28 april , in pravda , but to speak to the people , i needed a more substantial and precise analysis .
that is why i waited almost three weeks before speaking on television .
correct response ?
nowadays , experts think that our fears over the possible contamination of groundwater were exaggerated , and that it was not worth the trouble of installing a " cushion " -lsb- concrete slab -rsb- underneath the reactor .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past the construction of the sarcophagus , all the measures for aquatic protection , most of the measures aimed at decontamination - these were good decisions , even though some of the deactivation did ultimately prove to be superfluous .
we decontaminated areas which were later evacuated .
nobody knew , for instance , that pripyat , that beautiful modern city , would find itself forever uninhabitable .
at first , scientists thought that the population of pripyat would be able to return to the city around the end of may or beginning of june .
people left leaving their fridges full of food , without even unplugging them , since they expected to return quickly .
environmental cost the explosion at chernobyl showed that we are capable of contaminating the planet for the long term , and of leaving a terrible legacy for future generations .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past .
chernobyl clearly demonstrated that each disaster is unique and that no country can be prepared for every eventuality .
that is why we must deploy the maximum amount of effort to prevent disasters .
one must not compromise on nuclear safety .
the social , ecological and economic consequences of these kind of disasters are much too heavy in every sense of the word .
we can therefore see what enormous responsibility is placed not only on politicians , but on scientists , engineers and designers - their mistakes could cost the life and health of millions of people .
the victims of chernobyl continue to suffer both physically and mentally .
it is our moral duty to help them while continuing to limit the ecological consequences of this disaster .
mikhail gorbachev was interviewed by green cross international , a non-governmental organisation he founded in the wake of chernobyl .
a fuller version is appearing in the latest issue of the optimist magazine .
how culpable was the soviet leadership for the chernobyl disaster ?
what do you think of mr gorbachev 's analysis of the dangers facing today 's world ?
name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .
your comments may be published on any bbc media worldwide .
terms & conditions it is clear in gorbachev 's admitting that reports were " embellished " that the soviet system of lies , deceit and propaganda helped to allow time to elapse that could have saved more lives and environmental damage .
he is aware through hindsight being involved directly in the disaster how dangerous , and uncontrollable nuclear power out of control can be .
nobody could have caused more damage to russia than the russians themselves .
today 's world has many countries holding nuclear weapons which is of course far more of a threat than the usa - ussr standoff of the past .
cat miller , melbourne , australia i am convinced that mr. m. gorbatschev had good intention of solving the problem scientifically and quietly , with least damage to the environment and populations , however , the soviet scientists were in a bind : 1 -rrb- never before having experienced such a catastrophe , and not being able to seek advise from abroad , were confused and afraid for a reprisal by the notorious kgb , 2 -rrb- all decision were made in moscow , they waited for a directives from the top , 3 -rrb- silence , was the motto of the former ussr government .
i had the pleasure of speaking with several scientists from the ukrainian academy of science , after the collapse of the soviet union , and they affirmed my suspicion .
in 1990 , i organized scientific conference on environmental disasters , primarily ecological , and several distinguished scientists from ukraine attended the conference and presented papers on the subject , and we learned a lot from their presentations , known as " the first-hand experience " .
i am also convinced that the ukrainian scientists have and know more about the disaster , that they are willing to share with us .
let 's hope that it will never happened again .

but , of course , our main concern was to evacuate the population from the most contaminated areas .
on 27 april we performed an exemplary operation : in just three hours the entire population of pripyat , located very close to the power station , was evacuated .
and in the early days of may , we evacuated everybody living within a 30km radius of the power station , in dozens of localities : a total of 116,000 people .
told the truth ?
quite simply , in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants we needed several weeks to obtain precise evaluations and to draw up maps of the contamination .
certainly , i will not exclude the possibility that certain functionaries , who were afraid of being accused of not having taken the correct measures , had a tendency to embellish their reports .
but , for the most part , i believe that i was kept informed in good faith by my representatives .
we did not cancel the may day parades -lsb- in kiev and minsk -rsb- because we still did not have information on the full extent of the disaster .
i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants .
i admit that it was a grave mistake .
we published the first information on the accident on 28 april , in pravda , but to speak to the people , i needed a more substantial and precise analysis .
that is why i waited almost three weeks before speaking on television .
correct response ?
nowadays , experts think that our fears over the possible contamination of groundwater were exaggerated , and that it was not worth the trouble of installing a " cushion " -lsb- concrete slab -rsb- underneath the reactor .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past the construction of the sarcophagus , all the measures for aquatic protection , most of the measures aimed at decontamination - these were good decisions , even though some of the deactivation did ultimately prove to be superfluous .
we decontaminated areas which were later evacuated .
nobody knew , for instance , that pripyat , that beautiful modern city , would find itself forever uninhabitable .
at first , scientists thought that the population of pripyat would be able to return to the city around the end of may or beginning of june .
people left leaving their fridges full of food , without even unplugging them , since they expected to return quickly .
environmental cost the explosion at chernobyl showed that we are capable of contaminating the planet for the long term , and of leaving a terrible legacy for future generations .
today , mankind faces a challenge so huge that , by comparison , the cold war appears like an incongruous vestige from the past .
chernobyl clearly demonstrated that each disaster is unique and that no country can be prepared for every eventuality .
that is why we must deploy the maximum amount of effort to prevent disasters .
one must not compromise on nuclear safety .
the social , ecological and economic consequences of these kind of disasters are much too heavy in every sense of the word .
we can therefore see what enormous responsibility is placed not only on politicians , but on scientists , engineers and designers - their mistakes could cost the life and health of millions of people .
the victims of chernobyl continue to suffer both physically and mentally .
it is our moral duty to help them while continuing to limit the ecological consequences of this disaster .
mikhail gorbachev was interviewed by green cross international , a non-governmental organisation he founded in the wake of chernobyl .
a fuller version is appearing in the latest issue of the optimist magazine .
how culpable was the soviet leadership for the chernobyl disaster ?
what do you think of mr gorbachev 's analysis of the dangers facing today 's world ?
name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .
your comments may be published on any bbc media worldwide .
terms & conditions it is clear in gorbachev 's admitting that reports were " embellished " that the soviet system of lies , deceit and propaganda helped to allow time to elapse that could have saved more lives and environmental damage .
he is aware through hindsight being involved directly in the disaster how dangerous , and uncontrollable nuclear power out of control can be .
nobody could have caused more damage to russia than the russians themselves .
today 's world has many countries holding nuclear weapons which is of course far more of a threat than the usa - ussr standoff of the past .
cat miller , melbourne , australia i am convinced that mr. m. gorbatschev had good intention of solving the problem scientifically and quietly , with least damage to the environment and populations , however , the soviet scientists were in a bind : 1 -rrb- never before having experienced such a catastrophe , and not being able to seek advise from abroad , were confused and afraid for a reprisal by the notorious kgb , 2 -rrb- all decision were made in moscow , they waited for a directives from the top , 3 -rrb- silence , was the motto of the former ussr government .
i had the pleasure of speaking with several scientists from the ukrainian academy of science , after the collapse of the soviet union , and they affirmed my suspicion .
in 1990 , i organized scientific conference on environmental disasters , primarily ecological , and several distinguished scientists from ukraine attended the conference and presented papers on the subject , and we learned a lot from their presentations , known as " the first-hand experience " .
i am also convinced that the ukrainian scientists have and know more about the disaster , that they are willing to share with us .
let 's hope that it will never happened again .
dr.j.g. kurys , toronto , ontario , canada i had a lot of respect for gorbachev until i read this interview .
i can not understand how he could have waited for 3 weeks before telling his own people they were being killed .
michal kirejczyk , toronto , canada i think mr. gorbachev is very accurate in his assessment of the dangers we all must face .
he is being forthright in his analysis and the governments of the world should take is experience seriously .
patricia ross eastman , st paul mn usa for the disaster itself the soviet leadership can not be held responsible directly , but for the slow informing or covering up they can be blamed .
i think mr gorbachev is right in stating that we should n't compromise on nuclear safety .
hope to be able to find a copy of the optimist magazine for the complete interview .
dick vestdijk , netherlands like all disasters , we always come up with the answers from hindsight .
i think that mr.gorbachev acted in good faith without being informed of the full nature of the disaster .
however , his administration and top scientists should be held accountable for an improper analysis of the gravity of the situation and failure to act decisively and rapidly to minimise casualties .
in this instance he should have taken the welfare and safety of his people first .
in any major accident at any nuclear power plant it must be dealt with as if the threat is serious , later on , if it proves otherwise , the people in charge can justify the over reaction by simply stating that human safety was paramount .
mr gorbachev 's analysis of the nuclear dangers facing today 's world is prophetic , and i wish that certain other leaders will take a hint from him .
and as he stated we have a moral duty to help the victims .
patanjali ramlall , miami , florida , usa ultimately , the real cause was the chase for economic conditions like the western world ; fostered by the western world 's ever-increasing economic rush itself , which is not perceived as being unsustainable -lrb- to put it at it 's mildest and kindest -rrb- .
as for the analysis : stark but inadequate .
only when terrorists create pripyat conditions in a western city , or there is another nuclear war -lrb- hopefully between smaller nations and not superpowers -rrb- , will people begin to see the nuclear conundrum in a better perspective. philip gray , torun , poland i 'm most interested by mr. gorbachev 's comment , " i confess that we were afraid of panic - you can imagine for yourselves the consequences of a terrible panic in a town of several million inhabitants . "
in both the -lrb- former -rrb- soviet union and in china , a reflexive fear of " panic " -lrb- or uprisings -rrb- seems at times to prevent clear thinking among the leadership .
compare this with the similar - but not identical - fear of bad publicity or political consequences which too often paralyzes leaders in the u.s. and in european countries .
ralph dratman , cherry hill , nj , usa mr. gorbachev was -lrb- and is -rrb- in the unfortunate position of culpability for responsibilities which were not directly his .
from all accounts , the accident , misinformation , and subsequent mistakes such as the intentional flooding of the reactor which resulted from this misinformation , resulted from mistakes made by bureaucrats and technicians who were directly responsible on the site itself .
one could correctly state that the bureaucratic culture which allowed these initial exaggerations and cover-ups was created by , and was the responsibility of gorbachev and the rest of the soviet state .
also , it is the responsibility of leadership to assume blame for the appointing of the men and women responsible for the accident .
mr. gorbachev can rightly take credit for ordering helpful actions -lrb- such as the mass evacuations and the construction of the sarcophagus -rrb- which took place after the fact .
it is disturbing , however , to note that some 20 years after the accident , the chernobyl site has still not been permanently cleaned up .
david hilbert , ann arbor , usa gorbachev is right for the wrong reasons .
the earth now has the responsibility for radioactive waste storage and for nuclear weapons which can destroy life on this planet .
the engineering was easy , but politics is not , and the political world now has the bigger problem of controlling nuclear waste and weapons .

fewer british patients were involved in treatment decisions , and they were less likely to take part in a medication review or be given information about medicine side-effects than those in the other countries .

but a new wave of games is turning the cliché on its head .
nintendo has sold nearly five million copies of its three nintendo ds brain training games since the series launched in japan a year ago .
the first title in the series , dr kawashima 's brain training : how old is your brain ? , sees players follow a daily regime of brain-enhancing exercises and is due to be released in the uk in june .
dr kawashima 's brain training comprises a variety of mini-games designed to give brains a workout .
activities include solving simple maths problems , counting people going in and out of a house , drawing pictures on the nintendo ds touchscreen , and reading classic literature aloud into the device 's microphone .
players are given a brain age reflecting their performance .
over time , your brain age should get younger as you achieve better scores .
smart thinking dr kawashima 's brain training has sold some 1.8 million copies , and it is still in the japanese top 10 a year after release .
but the brain training games ' success is down to more than just a neat gameplay gimmick .
the brain training games for the ds have sold well unlike nintendo 's fictional creations , such as donkey kong or mario , dr kawashima really is a leading japanese brain expert .
a graduate of the tohuku university school of medicine , dr kawashima works at the same university 's new industry creation hatchery centre , and is one of the country 's top researchers into brain imaging .
he is also a best-selling author .
his two books on brain training have sold more than a million copies in japan .
nintendo 's president satoru iwata personally shepherded the idea of a brain-enhancing game through production .
it originally arose from a remark by a member of nintendo 's board of directors that he knew nobody his own age who played games .
and mr iwata sought dr kawashima 's involvement , seeing the two men 's similar fifty-something ages as common ground .
it is all a long way from a typical video game 's development , and the differences continue in the older , non-gamers that nintendo is explicitly targeting with the title .
dr kawashima 's brain training will be the first video game ever to be advertised and featured in saga magazine , for instance .
" as these new types of games gain in popularity , we must find new and different ways to bring them to new audiences , many of whom will have never played a traditional videogame before , " explained a nintendo spokesperson .
mobile mindset nintendo has not got a monopoly on brain training games , however .
mobile phone developer upstart games is creating iq academy , a reworking of the japanese mobile title right brain paradise , which has been a big hit in asia .
i think we have a critical mass of people that have been exposed to games for the last 25 years , and there is much wider acceptance of games as an entertainment medium barry o 'neill , upstart games iq academy gauges the player 's performance in various tasks of recognition , logical prediction and spatial resolution .
it then rates the player and mixes up the puzzles offered next time , promoting further improvement .
whereas nintendo 's games use the ds 's stylus and touchscreen , iq academy employs a simple multiple choice system .
" the nice thing about iq academy is that it does n't require any specialist hardware to work , " said barry o 'neill , ceo of upstart games .
" almost anyone with a mobile phone will be able to download and play it . "
mr o 'neill said there is a definite " halo effect " around brain games thanks to nintendo 's titles .
but he added that it is the broadening games audience that has really made such games more feasible .

" games that can challenge you from a mental perspective without falling into a gamer genre cliché are proving very popular . "
growing intelligence the brain wave might only just be hitting british shores , but in japan publishers are challenging nintendo with their own intelligence-focussed games .
carol vorderman is getting in on the craze sega is working with kenichiro mogi , a senior researcher at sony computer science research lab , on a thinking-based game for sony 's psp handheld .
and bandai namco is looking to integrate the action-orientated gameplay of its point blank arcade titles into a new brain game .
here in the uk , nintendo will follow up dr kawashima 's brain training with big brain academy later this year .
big brain academy estimates the weight of your brain from your performance in a series of tests .
it also compares your brain to great brains from history .
upstart games plans further iq academy games too , including a 3d version that presents the player with spatial awareness challenges .

the first title in the series , dr kawashima 's brain training : how old is your brain ? , sees players follow a daily regime of brain-enhancing exercises and is due to be released in the uk in june .
dr kawashima 's brain training comprises a variety of mini-games designed to give brains a workout .
activities include solving simple maths problems , counting people going in and out of a house , drawing pictures on the nintendo ds touchscreen , and reading classic literature aloud into the device 's microphone .
players are given a brain age reflecting their performance .
over time , your brain age should get younger as you achieve better scores .
smart thinking dr kawashima 's brain training has sold some 1.8 million copies , and it is still in the japanese top 10 a year after release .
but the brain training games ' success is down to more than just a neat gameplay gimmick .
the brain training games for the ds have sold well unlike nintendo 's fictional creations , such as donkey kong or mario , dr kawashima really is a leading japanese brain expert .
a graduate of the tohuku university school of medicine , dr kawashima works at the same university 's new industry creation hatchery centre , and is one of the country 's top researchers into brain imaging .
he is also a best-selling author .
his two books on brain training have sold more than a million copies in japan .
nintendo 's president satoru iwata personally shepherded the idea of a brain-enhancing game through production .
it originally arose from a remark by a member of nintendo 's board of directors that he knew nobody his own age who played games .
and mr iwata sought dr kawashima 's involvement , seeing the two men 's similar fifty-something ages as common ground .
it is all a long way from a typical video game 's development , and the differences continue in the older , non-gamers that nintendo is explicitly targeting with the title .
dr kawashima 's brain training will be the first video game ever to be advertised and featured in saga magazine , for instance .
" as these new types of games gain in popularity , we must find new and different ways to bring them to new audiences , many of whom will have never played a traditional videogame before , " explained a nintendo spokesperson .
mobile mindset nintendo has not got a monopoly on brain training games , however .
mobile phone developer upstart games is creating iq academy , a reworking of the japanese mobile title right brain paradise , which has been a big hit in asia .
i think we have a critical mass of people that have been exposed to games for the last 25 years , and there is much wider acceptance of games as an entertainment medium barry o 'neill , upstart games iq academy gauges the player 's performance in various tasks of recognition , logical prediction and spatial resolution .
it then rates the player and mixes up the puzzles offered next time , promoting further improvement .
whereas nintendo 's games use the ds 's stylus and touchscreen , iq academy employs a simple multiple choice system .
" the nice thing about iq academy is that it does n't require any specialist hardware to work , " said barry o 'neill , ceo of upstart games .
" almost anyone with a mobile phone will be able to download and play it . "
mr o 'neill said there is a definite " halo effect " around brain games thanks to nintendo 's titles .
but he added that it is the broadening games audience that has really made such games more feasible .

" games that can challenge you from a mental perspective without falling into a gamer genre cliché are proving very popular . "
growing intelligence the brain wave might only just be hitting british shores , but in japan publishers are challenging nintendo with their own intelligence-focussed games .

and bandai namco is looking to integrate the action-orientated gameplay of its point blank arcade titles into a new brain game .
here in the uk , nintendo will follow up dr kawashima 's brain training with big brain academy later this year .
big brain academy estimates the weight of your brain from your performance in a series of tests .
it also compares your brain to great brains from history .
upstart games plans further iq academy games too , including a 3d version that presents the player with spatial awareness challenges .
and last year 's brain-teasing craze , suduko , is also getting a digital makeover .
carol vorderman 's sudoku , released late last year on the pc , will arrive in a psp version this june .

dr kawashima 's brain training comprises a variety of mini-games designed to give brains a workout .
activities include solving simple maths problems , counting people going in and out of a house , drawing pictures on the nintendo ds touchscreen , and reading classic literature aloud into the device 's microphone .
players are given a brain age reflecting their performance .

the timetable boost is one of a number of plans for the west coast main line service unveiled by the virgin trains boss on monday .
more frequent services between london and liverpool , chester , glasgow and north wales are also planned .
sir richard said his company would also bid for the cross country rail route when its franchise ends in 2007 .
in recent years , virgin has run both its west coast and cross country franchises on a year-by-year contract .
in october last year , the department for transport said it would be re-letting a reconstituted cross country franchise in autumn 2007 .
we are talking with network rail about running at 135mph on some parts of the route tony collins , chief executive on monday , sir richard said virgin intended to bid for cross country and told staff in a website broadcast : " we 've started so we 'll finish . "
" there were many cynics who just laughed at our plans when we launched the franchises .
they said it could never be done and at one point even i briefly wondered if they might have been right .
" but we persevered and the virgin rail operation of today is a shining example of what can be achieved with the right vision . "
virgin also unveiled plans to boost the speed of its tilting pendolino trains from 125mph to 135mph on some sections of the west coast line .
passenger rise it currently operates more than 50 pendolinos and has seen passengers rise on the west coast from 15.4m in 1998-99 to 18.7m in 2005-06 .
in the same period , cross country passengers have risen from 13.6m to 20.4m.
virgin trains chief executive tony collins said : " we need to look now at more pendolino trains and more carriages on the existing trains , otherwise we will inhibit further growth .
we also need to improve car parking at stations .
" these are not some vague ideas for the future ; they are real issues that we are already progressing .
we also have trains that can travel at 140mph , but are restricted to 125mph .
" we are talking with network rail about running at 135mph on some parts of the route .
we believe we can do this , not in 20 years ' time , or even 10 years ' time - but from 2008 . "

silas siakor , 36 , has won a goldman environmental prize for his efforts , which resulted in the un banning the export of liberian timber .
the awards are described as " the nobel prize for grassroots environmentalism " .
mr siakor and five other winners will receive their awards on monday at a presentation ceremony in san francisco .
working for the liberian environmental group save my future foundation -lrb- samfu -rrb- , mr siakor revealed in 2002 that president charles taylor 's regime was selling off the nation 's forests to timber companies .
it is understood that warring factions in the region turned to logging after the trade in so-called " blood diamonds " became subject to un sanctions .
according to the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , illegal logging during the 14 years of civil war had reduced the nation 's forest cover by almost one fifth .
personal touch mr siakor worked alongside industry contacts and fellow campaigners to gather a dossier of evidence showing the full extent of the illegal logging , corruption and human rights abuses that was fuelling the civil war .
what started as a simple exchange of material amongst a small group of people soon formed the basis of a report which caught the attention of the international community .
" in 2002 , we decided that we needed a change in strategy , " mr siakor said .
" we knew that the personal touch would have an impact on international policy .
" when we published the report it was being quoted more and more within the international debate , and the liberian government came under increasing pressure to act , " he added .
the publicity surrounding the report angered the government .
evidence contained in the report had led to the un security council banning the export of timber from liberia , which had an impact on the funds available to the warring factions in the civil war .
' big trouble ' " at one point , president taylor himself referred to the report on national radio , " mr siakor recalled .
" he said that the people who were responsible for the report would be in very big trouble if he got his hands on them . "
the president 's warning , combined with a summons to appear before the nation 's senate , led to mr siakor 's colleagues advising him to leave liberia for a period of exile spent in several neighbouring countries .
in august 2003 , charles taylor himself fled , handing power to his deputy .
soon after , un peacekeepers arrived in liberia .
mr taylor would eventually face trial for crimes against humanity during the civil war which saw more than 250,000 people killed .
towards the end of 2005 , ellen johnson-sirleaf became president , the first woman to be elected as an african head of state .
she cancelled all previous timber concessions made by the previous government and has promised to carry out a series of reforms .
however , this is not the end of the road for mr siakor .
the international sanctions on timber exports are set to be lifted in june .
' social momentum ' as director of the sustainable development institute -lrb- sdi -rrb- , he published a report in january outlining the sort of reforms he feels need to be carried out in order to protect the long term future of liberia 's forests and the wildlife that depends upon them .
mr siakor hopes that winning the goldman environmental prize will encourage others to follow in his footsteps .
" i would like to see more and more local people take on these issues , " he said .
" we are going to need people who will insist that the rate we extract these natural resources must allow for natural regeneration .
" what we are doing now within the sdi is to support more grassroot involvement , a social momentum , that will take on this sort of campaign .
if people are empowered to actively engage with the government , i strongly believe that this will be good for overall political governance . "
the other winners of the goldman prizes , being presented in san francisco on 24 april , include : a young ukrainian lawyer who successfully brought a temporary halt to the construction of a canal that would have cut through one of the world 's most valuable wetlands , the danube delta. a veteran of the vietnam war who convinced the pentagon to stop plans to incinerate stockpiles of old chemical weapons. a brazilian whose efforts led to the creation of the world 's largest group of protected tropical forests , which had been under threat of illegal logging .

mr siakor went into exile after charles taylor said he was in ' big trouble ' the president 's warning , combined with a summons to appear before the nation 's senate , led to mr siakor 's colleagues advising him to leave liberia for a period of exile spent in several neighbouring countries .
in august 2003 , charles taylor himself fled , handing power to his deputy .
soon after , un peacekeepers arrived in liberia .
mr taylor would eventually face trial for crimes against humanity during the civil war which saw more than 250,000 people killed .
towards the end of 2005 , ellen johnson-sirleaf became president , the first woman to be elected as an african head of state .
she cancelled all previous timber concessions made by the previous government and has promised to carry out a series of reforms .
however , this is not the end of the road for mr siakor .
the international sanctions on timber exports are set to be lifted in june .
' social momentum ' as director of the sustainable development institute -lrb- sdi -rrb- , he published a report in january outlining the sort of reforms he feels need to be carried out in order to protect the long term future of liberia 's forests and the wildlife that depends upon them .
mr siakor hopes that winning the goldman environmental prize will encourage others to follow in his footsteps .
" i would like to see more and more local people take on these issues , " he said .
" we are going to need people who will insist that the rate we extract these natural resources must allow for natural regeneration .
" what we are doing now within the sdi is to support more grassroot involvement , a social momentum , that will take on this sort of campaign .
if people are empowered to actively engage with the government , i strongly believe that this will be good for overall political governance . "
the other winners of the goldman prizes , being presented in san francisco on 24 april , include : a young ukrainian lawyer who successfully brought a temporary halt to the construction of a canal that would have cut through one of the world 's most valuable wetlands , the danube delta. a veteran of the vietnam war who convinced the pentagon to stop plans to incinerate stockpiles of old chemical weapons. a brazilian whose efforts led to the creation of the world 's largest group of protected tropical forests , which had been under threat of illegal logging .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- state guarantee for bt pensions home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 24 april 2006 , 08:49 gmt 09:49 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version state guarantee for bt pensions bt has a large pension deficit bt has said that it believes that the government will guarantee an estimated 75 % of its pension fund liabilities , currently worth about £ 37bn .
the disclosure comes amid speculation about the extent of state protection for bt 's pension liabilities under the terms of its 1984 privatisation .
the " crown guarantee " underwrites the retirement benefits of 262,000 pensioners , should the firm collapse .
according to its most recent valuation , bt has a £ 2.1bn deficit on its scheme .
privatisation guarantee the crown guarantee will only be triggered in the unlikely event that bt is declared insolvent and its pension scheme wound up .
bt stands fully behind its pension promise to pensioners and members sir christopher bland , bt chairman it applies to those members of staff and retirees who joined bt 's final salary pension scheme prior to its privatisation in 1984 .
however , the safety net does not apply to the 97,000 pension scheme members who joined after then .
bt closed its final salary scheme to new members in 2001 .
staff who have joined the company 's new defined benefits scheme since then are also not covered by the guarantee .
safety net the existence of the guarantee - details of which only emerged earlier this month - could reduce the amount of money that bt has to make into the new pension protection fund .
under new rules , all the uk 's top firms are required to pay into a government-backed fund designed to protect employee pensions in the event of company failure .
individual company payments are currently being worked out but the guarantee means that bt 's liabilities could be viewed as less high risk and thus reduce its payments .
bt said the guarantee was " an extra layer of security " for bt pensioners , most of whom no longer work for the company .

royal college of nursing general secretary dr beverly malone told ministers to start treating nurses like " valued professionals " .
speaking at the rcn 's annual conference , she said nurses support reforms that benefit patients .
but she added they are prepared to oppose change as well if they perceive the future of the nhs to be threatened . "
government , listen up , you need to stop treating us like overheads to be cut and start treating us like valued professional " dr beverly malone , royal college of nursing hewitt under pressure nurse 's views on the nhs more than 2,000 nurses are expected at the conference in bournemouth where nhs deficits , privatisation and providing care in the community will be discussed .
her speech comes after health secretary patricia hewitt was condemned for saying the nhs had enjoyed its " best year ever " .
ms hewitt said there had been no winter bed crisis and waiting times were at their lowest ever level .
nurses ' goodwill ms malone said that the government should remember that nhs services , patient care and successful reform relies " on the goodwill of nurses " .
she said : " if they want proof they should take a long hard look at the unpaid overtime worked by nurses - an average of one day extra every week of the year .
" undermine and lose that goodwill and our healthcare system will be plunged into crisis .
" so government , listen up , you need to stop treating us like overheads to be cut and start treating us like valued professionals .
" because if you do n't , the goodwill of nurses is going to melt away like ice in the spring .
" and believe me , right now , the ice that ministers are skating on does n't come any thinner and it is melting fast . "
testing times ms malone told nurses it has been a year of " tough and testing times " . "
i 'm sick of the angel tag " sylvia denton , royal college of nursing she attacked the government over its pension provision and 2.5 % pay deal for nurses , saying she shares " the hurt , the upset , and frankly the anger that many nurses feel towards it . "
speaking at a press conference after her speech , dr malone said nurses feared they would be pushed into a situation where providing care would resemble working in a factory .
if the situation with job cuts and deficits continued , nurses would consider taking action .
she said nurses worked the equivalent of one day of unpaid overtime a week and could withdraw from doing that in what would effectively amount to a work to rule .
" we are talking a long way down the line .
but we may consider not working those hours , but such action is always a last resort because nurses are always going to be looking at how to make sure patients are safe . "
rcn president sylvia denton also urged the government and others to stop patronising nurses by calling them " angels " .
she said nurses had shared values , but added : " what these values do n't do is make us ' angels ' .
" i 'm sick of the angel tag because for years it has allowed governments and employers to pat nurses on the head , say how wonderful we are , argue that nursing is a vocation rather than a job , and then use that as an excuse to leave us overworked , overstretched and underpaid . "
but chief nursing officer christine beasley defended the government "s record , saying money has been invested .
" we have 80,000 more nurses than in 1997 , with starting pay rising by 55 % in the same period .
" in the minority of hospitals currently in deficit the threat of compulsory redundancy will be contained to as few people as possible and in many cases changes will be achieved through cutting down on agency staff . "

health secretary patricia hewitt insists nhs has just had its best year , but unions say patient care will be severely hit .
anne leedham smith , regional organiser for the rcn in the east midlands the health services continues to provide a very good service but what we are talking about is these deficits and the fact that nurses ca n't get jobs when they qualify .
in the west midlands alone , 4,000 nurses will not get jobs this year .
we 've had 3,000 jobs lost already in the last few weeks and it is going to continue .
we 've known about these deficits for a long time but the government just decided to pull the plug and now we 've got this crisis on our hands .
nobody denies the trusts have got to balance their books , however , we have known about these deficits for four or five years .
bank loans ?
what they -lrb- the government -rrb- should do is slow down .
let 's look at these deficits and change it to something like a bank loan so they -lrb- the trusts -rrb- have to pay it back over 10 years .
these deficits are as a result of a historical position .
for example if you take worcester , they have had a deficit as a result of the failed building of their hospitals and because of mergers .
it 's also been about putting in reforms - trusts have n't got enough money to make them work .
i accept that there are job freezes , but we have got to look at the reality that student nurses who are qualifying this year will not get jobs .
we will have a surfeit of people who are qualified to do a job which they ca n't do .
in my opinion , that 's people going from areas where nurses are particularly needed .
gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation there 's always a sort of laziness which assumes that everyone who works in the nhs works in a hospital .
what we 've been doing over the last few years is developing more services and systems to allow patients to stay in their own homes .
this must be good because we know that patients want to be in their own homes as long as possible .
some of the changes are already happening in terms of staff numbers .
the largest group that 's affected by the changes are administrative and clerical staff .
we have just done a review of all our members trying to identify what 's going on .
one of the problems with a time like this is that there 's a lot of hot air and figures being bandied around , but none of these figures have an awful lot of evidence to them .
' not real jobs ' the survey that we have done suggests that the vast majority of posts that are being lost are not real jobs .
they are jobs that are being filled by agency staff or temporary staff and they are now being moved out of the system .
the majority of trusts are doing everything they can to actually avoid moving or losing clinical staff .
a skilled an effective work force is really important .
the nhs has already done a tremendous amount over the last year .
we 've reduced waiting lists , we have provided new forms of treatment , we are thinking hard about the productivity question .
we are bringing far more patients in on the day of operations rather than keeping them unnecessarily in hospital for a couple of days .
there are real significant changes going on but we have to set that against the fact that for a number of organisations there are significant financial challenges .

health secretary patricia hewitt insists nhs has just had its best year , but unions say patient care will be severely hit .
anne leedham smith , regional organiser for the rcn in the east midlands the health services continues to provide a very good service but what we are talking about is these deficits and the fact that nurses ca n't get jobs when they qualify .
in the west midlands alone , 4,000 nurses will not get jobs this year .
we 've had 3,000 jobs lost already in the last few weeks and it is going to continue .
we 've known about these deficits for a long time but the government just decided to pull the plug and now we 've got this crisis on our hands .
nobody denies the trusts have got to balance their books , however , we have known about these deficits for four or five years .
bank loans ?
what they -lrb- the government -rrb- should do is slow down .
let 's look at these deficits and change it to something like a bank loan so they -lrb- the trusts -rrb- have to pay it back over 10 years .
these deficits are as a result of a historical position .
for example if you take worcester , they have had a deficit as a result of the failed building of their hospitals and because of mergers .
it 's also been about putting in reforms - trusts have n't got enough money to make them work .
i accept that there are job freezes , but we have got to look at the reality that student nurses who are qualifying this year will not get jobs .
we will have a surfeit of people who are qualified to do a job which they ca n't do .
in my opinion , that 's people going from areas where nurses are particularly needed .
gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation there 's always a sort of laziness which assumes that everyone who works in the nhs works in a hospital .
what we 've been doing over the last few years is developing more services and systems to allow patients to stay in their own homes .
this must be good because we know that patients want to be in their own homes as long as possible .
some of the changes are already happening in terms of staff numbers .
the largest group that 's affected by the changes are administrative and clerical staff .
we have just done a review of all our members trying to identify what 's going on .
one of the problems with a time like this is that there 's a lot of hot air and figures being bandied around , but none of these figures have an awful lot of evidence to them .
' not real jobs ' the survey that we have done suggests that the vast majority of posts that are being lost are not real jobs .
they are jobs that are being filled by agency staff or temporary staff and they are now being moved out of the system .
the majority of trusts are doing everything they can to actually avoid moving or losing clinical staff .
a skilled an effective work force is really important .
the nhs has already done a tremendous amount over the last year .
we 've reduced waiting lists , we have provided new forms of treatment , we are thinking hard about the productivity question .
we are bringing far more patients in on the day of operations rather than keeping them unnecessarily in hospital for a couple of days .
there are real significant changes going on but we have to set that against the fact that for a number of organisations there are significant financial challenges .

will it work ?
the child exploitation and online protection centre -lrb- ceop -rrb- will be staffed 24 hours a day by about 100 police , computer technicians and child welfare specialists .
based in london , it is affiliated to the serious organised crime agency , the uk 's new fbi-style organisation .
but with 20,000 people regularly accessing illegal images via the internet in the uk , and twice as many paedophile websites reported in 2005 than the year before , will it make a difference ?
the key to its success could be having so many different agencies involved , says john carr , an adviser on new technology to the children 's charity , nch .
" for the first time they 're bringing under one physical roof all of the key players who have a stake in this , " he said .
staying safe online do n't give out personal details this includes messenger id , email address , mobile phone number and any pics do n't publish a pic or video online ignore spam emails do n't open files from people you do n't know some people lie online keep online mates online - do n't meet up report online child abuse source : ceop " it 's not just the police , child protection and the internet industry , there are people from the inland revenue , people from the financial services industry , the credit card industry .
" all of these people have got a contribution to make and for the first time they 're all going to be in the same room , so we 're hoping that that 's going to give them new energy and a new lift to the whole effort . "
a new tactic will be officers posing as children in online chatrooms to entrap paedophiles , and setting up fake websites to entice abusers to disclose credit card details .
neil thompson , security director of red 24 , which advises parents on the threat posed by online paedophiles , said the agency was a huge step forward , primarily because of this strategy .
" the key difference is the pro-active approach of the police .
they are going to draw the paedophiles in and success on this started in america , " he said .
" it 's not about waiting for the mother to contact the unit or the child , it 's about going out and entrapping the paedophile . "
beach hut parents worried about their child being contacted by paedophiles online can contact the agency and speak to specialists , including welfare officers , he said .
any suspicions will be followed up by police .
no-one knows the true number of children being groomed online to be abused , he said , because so much goes unreported . "
the way we have targeted drug dealers and people involved in other areas of organised crime , we will target these people who use these images as a commodity " jim gamble ceop director new unit targets online abuse and a man sitting in a beach hut in thailand could pretend to a child he is in the uk , so the cooperation of international police will be crucial .
the centre 's director , jim gamble , said a bespoke financial investigations unit will work with police around the world in targeting those who profit from the distribution of images of child abuse .
" the way we have targeted drug dealers and people involved in other areas of organised crime , we will target these people who use these images as a commodity , " he said .
" we will buy these images ourselves undercover , we will follow the money trail and then we will attack their assets - their homes , their cars and their bank accounts .
and we will use that money on further work . "
he said people should not be fooled into thinking those who " only " view are not doing any harm because the demand and payment for such pictures fuels the market , and these people could be abusers in the real world .
" so even those people who go online and look at images are indirectly pushing child abuse to new levels .
" the centre recognises that online behaviour has an offline consequence and offline interest will manifest itself in your online behaviour and activity . "

beach hut parents worried about their child being contacted by paedophiles online can contact the agency and speak to specialists , including welfare officers , he said .
any suspicions will be followed up by police .
no-one knows the true number of children being groomed online to be abused , he said , because so much goes unreported .
the way we have targeted drug dealers and people involved in other areas of organised crime , we will target these people who use these images as a commodity jim gamble ceop director new unit targets online abuse and a man sitting in a beach hut in thailand could pretend to a child he is in the uk , so the cooperation of international police will be crucial .
the centre 's director , jim gamble , said a bespoke financial investigations unit will work with police around the world in targeting those who profit from the distribution of images of child abuse .
" the way we have targeted drug dealers and people involved in other areas of organised crime , we will target these people who use these images as a commodity , " he said .
" we will buy these images ourselves undercover , we will follow the money trail and then we will attack their assets - their homes , their cars and their bank accounts .
and we will use that money on further work . "
he said people should not be fooled into thinking those who " only " view are not doing any harm because the demand and payment for such pictures fuels the market , and these people could be abusers in the real world .
" so even those people who go online and look at images are indirectly pushing child abuse to new levels .
" the centre recognises that online behaviour has an offline consequence and offline interest will manifest itself in your online behaviour and activity . "
