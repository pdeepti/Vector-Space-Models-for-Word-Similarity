yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .

the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms . " we expect we can open at least one chapter of negotiations in june , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .
and that is not to be expected in this case , " the diw found . euro 2004 : recession 's blow softened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel industry hopes the presidential suites are booked longer the organizers of the euro 2004 in portugal also saw the soccer event as an economic opportunity .
around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match . " we produced our largest advertising campaign ever , " said antonio padeira , director of portugal 's national tourism institute , itp .
" the slogan was : the post-match time is the best part of the match .
our ads showed a modern portugal with numerous holiday destinations .
they put tourism at the center .
soccer hardly appeared .
just enough so that the ads could be connected with the championships . " the strategy worked .
on average , they stayed a half week longer .
that just may be the modest goal german hoteliers want to achieve after the world cup 2006 . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is … german tourism with a million foreign visitors expected for the 2006 world cup soccer games , and another 40 million television viewers globally , the german tourism industry is eager to promote curry sausages and the cologne cathedral .

however the total number of right-wing extremists had declined marginally from 40,700 to 39,000 because of a drop in the numbers of two of three right-wing parties , the deutsche volksunion -lrb- german people 's union -rrb- and the republicans , the paper reported . highlighting the threat posed by these groups , a politician in berlin 's regional assembly who is of turkish origin was seriously injured in berlin on friday after being attacked by two men who called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party politician giyasettin sayan giyasettin sayan of the left party suffered head injuries and bruising after he was struck by a bottle in a street in his lichtenberg ward in the east of the capital . police slow to react , politician says social democratic parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who is half indian , has publicly said that he would not travel to certain parts of berlin at night , further fuelling the debate that has started about labeling certain areas in eastern germany " no-go " zones for dark-skinned foreigners . in the bild am sonntag , edathy said that quite often , police are too slow to react to incidents with a potentially racist background . " there are cases in which the police do n't act quickly enough , " he said .
" complaints and phone calls are sometimes not taken seriously enough . " edathy called for police to place a higher priority on dealing with right-wing extremism when training staff . bad news for world cup visitors ? concern at the possibility of racial violence has been increasing ahead of the world cup scheduled to start on june 9 , following news of several racist attacks in berlin and eastern germany in recent weeks . some observers fear that neo-nazis will try to exploit the event by holding demonstrations to spread their ideas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say they ca n't ensure safety at demos such as this one during the world cup speaking to news magazine der spiegel , the head of germany 's police union , konrad freiburg , appealed to authorities not to permit any demonstrations close to stadiums where world cup matches will be played . one right-wing rally is already expected to take place in leipzig on june 21 when iran will be playing angola .
neo-nazis plan to back up anti-semitic statements made by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , der spiegel reported . freiberg was quoted by the magazine as saying that the police would be unable to ensure safety during such demonstrations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates future funding of fight against extremism federal funding for a multitude of programs to fight right-wing extremism in germany is coming up for review .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2006 a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very little is known about life behind bars in germany germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .
apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .
" the gadgets are then sent out to a dealer and checked for illegal things like arms , drugs , money or secret information .
if they 're fine , they are brought back in and i seal them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners have to do mandatory work in germany the prisoners can also work in the kitchen , laundry , garbage disposal or in workshops where large external companies also commission work .
the inmates are paid much less than what they would get for the same work outside .
the maximum wage is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 385.8 -rrb- a month . " they have to save a large part of the wages for the time after their release , " said angela wozlaw , deputy head of the cologne prison , adding that they can use a small part for shopping . but wozlaw also said that the prisoners could only order what they wanted on a list and the items are then brought from outside . drugs a part of priso n life other than work and school , there 's not much else the prisoners can do in their free time .
they can use a library or do sports for an hour and a half each week .
some of them meet their lawyer . each prisoner is allowed to receive visitors for half an hour four times a month .
the small visiting room with wooden tables is outfitted with mirrors in each corner to allow prison officials to monitor the meetings .
despite that the visiting room carries the risk of drugs being smuggled in , wozlaw said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates only start taking drugs in prison " i would be lying if i said we can prevent that , " she said .
" it 's just not true .
we could only do that if we completely sealed off the prison and stopped all human contact , " she said .
" for instance some visitors smuggle drugs in their mouth and it 's passed on through a welcome kiss .
women who come to the prison often hide drugs in their lower bodies . " even though it 's not spoken of , drugs are a part of life in prison , said wozlaw , adding that for many the prison is their first contact point with drugs . drug dealers are often the most respected persons in the pecking order among prisoners , wozlaw said .

apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .
" the gadgets are then sent out to a dealer and checked for illegal things like arms , drugs , money or secret information .
if they 're fine , they are brought back in and i seal them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners have to do mandatory work in germany the prisoners can also work in the kitchen , laundry , garbage disposal or in workshops where large external companies also commission work .
the inmates are paid much less than what they would get for the same work outside .
the maximum wage is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 385.8 -rrb- a month . " they have to save a large part of the wages for the time after their release , " said angela wozlaw , deputy head of the cologne prison , adding that they can use a small part for shopping . but wozlaw also said that the prisoners could only order what they wanted on a list and the items are then brought from outside . drugs a part of priso n life other than work and school , there 's not much else the prisoners can do in their free time .
they can use a library or do sports for an hour and a half each week .
some of them meet their lawyer . each prisoner is allowed to receive visitors for half an hour four times a month .
the small visiting room with wooden tables is outfitted with mirrors in each corner to allow prison officials to monitor the meetings .
despite that the visiting room carries the risk of drugs being smuggled in , wozlaw said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates only start taking drugs in prison " i would be lying if i said we can prevent that , " she said .
" it 's just not true .
we could only do that if we completely sealed off the prison and stopped all human contact , " she said .
" for instance some visitors smuggle drugs in their mouth and it 's passed on through a welcome kiss .
women who come to the prison often hide drugs in their lower bodies . " even though it 's not spoken of , drugs are a part of life in prison , said wozlaw , adding that for many the prison is their first contact point with drugs . drug dealers are often the most respected persons in the pecking order among prisoners , wozlaw said . " we 've concluded that sexual abuse and rape ranks at the bottom of prisoner hierarchy , but rapists are still a notch above child molesters , " she said . bei n g treated as huma n s for first time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he be able to lead a normal life once he 's released ?
prison official peter piontek saidthat scuffles and fights among inmates are a regular occurrence .
as punishment , inmates are often confined to their cells for a week . many of them learn to eat with fork and knife in the prison for the first time in their lives and for others it 's also the first time that they learn to stick to rules and have a fixed routine . " for many it 's really the first place where they are seen as humans and not just as scum on the streets , " piontek said . silke oppermann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister , unions disagree on germany 's crime level crime rates in germany are down and the police are more effective , making the country one of the safest places in the world .
that 's the claim of interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
police unions , however , disagree .

it 's a similar story across europe , but government efforts to find a solution vary across the continent .

many offenses are petty , such as shoplifting and traffic violations , but some are more serious .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .
and that is not to be expected in this case , " the diw found . euro 2004 : recession 's blow softened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel industry hopes the presidential suites are booked longer the organizers of the euro 2004 in portugal also saw the soccer event as an economic opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.05.2006 happiness is danish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danes are happier than most life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?
the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?
i do not believe it , " zola wrote .
" it promised truth , and the question is to know if we will ever make happiness with truth .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?

many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .

apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .
" the gadgets are then sent out to a dealer and checked for illegal things like arms , drugs , money or secret information .
if they 're fine , they are brought back in and i seal them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners have to do mandatory work in germany the prisoners can also work in the kitchen , laundry , garbage disposal or in workshops where large external companies also commission work .
the inmates are paid much less than what they would get for the same work outside .
the maximum wage is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 385.8 -rrb- a month . " they have to save a large part of the wages for the time after their release , " said angela wozlaw , deputy head of the cologne prison , adding that they can use a small part for shopping . but wozlaw also said that the prisoners could only order what they wanted on a list and the items are then brought from outside . drugs a part of priso n life other than work and school , there 's not much else the prisoners can do in their free time .
they can use a library or do sports for an hour and a half each week .
some of them meet their lawyer . each prisoner is allowed to receive visitors for half an hour four times a month .
the small visiting room with wooden tables is outfitted with mirrors in each corner to allow prison officials to monitor the meetings .
despite that the visiting room carries the risk of drugs being smuggled in , wozlaw said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates only start taking drugs in prison " i would be lying if i said we can prevent that , " she said .
" it 's just not true .
we could only do that if we completely sealed off the prison and stopped all human contact , " she said .
" for instance some visitors smuggle drugs in their mouth and it 's passed on through a welcome kiss .
women who come to the prison often hide drugs in their lower bodies . " even though it 's not spoken of , drugs are a part of life in prison , said wozlaw , adding that for many the prison is their first contact point with drugs . drug dealers are often the most respected persons in the pecking order among prisoners , wozlaw said . " we 've concluded that sexual abuse and rape ranks at the bottom of prisoner hierarchy , but rapists are still a notch above child molesters , " she said . bei n g treated as huma n s for first time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he be able to lead a normal life once he 's released ?
prison official peter piontek saidthat scuffles and fights among inmates are a regular occurrence .
as punishment , inmates are often confined to their cells for a week . many of them learn to eat with fork and knife in the prison for the first time in their lives and for others it 's also the first time that they learn to stick to rules and have a fixed routine . " for many it 's really the first place where they are seen as humans and not just as scum on the streets , " piontek said . silke oppermann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister , unions disagree on germany 's crime level crime rates in germany are down and the police are more effective , making the country one of the safest places in the world .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?

" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .

" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?

" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .

germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .

statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?
i do not believe it , " zola wrote .

in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?
i do not believe it , " zola wrote .
" it promised truth , and the question is to know if we will ever make happiness with truth .

apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .
" the gadgets are then sent out to a dealer and checked for illegal things like arms , drugs , money or secret information .
if they 're fine , they are brought back in and i seal them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners have to do mandatory work in germany the prisoners can also work in the kitchen , laundry , garbage disposal or in workshops where large external companies also commission work .
the inmates are paid much less than what they would get for the same work outside .
the maximum wage is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 385.8 -rrb- a month . " they have to save a large part of the wages for the time after their release , " said angela wozlaw , deputy head of the cologne prison , adding that they can use a small part for shopping . but wozlaw also said that the prisoners could only order what they wanted on a list and the items are then brought from outside . drugs a part of priso n life other than work and school , there 's not much else the prisoners can do in their free time .
they can use a library or do sports for an hour and a half each week .
some of them meet their lawyer . each prisoner is allowed to receive visitors for half an hour four times a month .
the small visiting room with wooden tables is outfitted with mirrors in each corner to allow prison officials to monitor the meetings .
despite that the visiting room carries the risk of drugs being smuggled in , wozlaw said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates only start taking drugs in prison " i would be lying if i said we can prevent that , " she said .
" it 's just not true .
we could only do that if we completely sealed off the prison and stopped all human contact , " she said .
" for instance some visitors smuggle drugs in their mouth and it 's passed on through a welcome kiss .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?
i do not believe it , " zola wrote .
" it promised truth , and the question is to know if we will ever make happiness with truth .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .

the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2006 a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very little is known about life behind bars in germany germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .
apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .
" the gadgets are then sent out to a dealer and checked for illegal things like arms , drugs , money or secret information .
if they 're fine , they are brought back in and i seal them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners have to do mandatory work in germany the prisoners can also work in the kitchen , laundry , garbage disposal or in workshops where large external companies also commission work .
the inmates are paid much less than what they would get for the same work outside .
the maximum wage is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 385.8 -rrb- a month . " they have to save a large part of the wages for the time after their release , " said angela wozlaw , deputy head of the cologne prison , adding that they can use a small part for shopping . but wozlaw also said that the prisoners could only order what they wanted on a list and the items are then brought from outside . drugs a part of priso n life other than work and school , there 's not much else the prisoners can do in their free time .
they can use a library or do sports for an hour and a half each week .
some of them meet their lawyer . each prisoner is allowed to receive visitors for half an hour four times a month .
the small visiting room with wooden tables is outfitted with mirrors in each corner to allow prison officials to monitor the meetings .

apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms . " we expect we can open at least one chapter of negotiations in june , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .
and that is not to be expected in this case , " the diw found . euro 2004 : recession 's blow softened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel industry hopes the presidential suites are booked longer the organizers of the euro 2004 in portugal also saw the soccer event as an economic opportunity .
around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match . " we produced our largest advertising campaign ever , " said antonio padeira , director of portugal 's national tourism institute , itp .
" the slogan was : the post-match time is the best part of the match .
our ads showed a modern portugal with numerous holiday destinations .
they put tourism at the center .
soccer hardly appeared .
just enough so that the ads could be connected with the championships . " the strategy worked .
on average , they stayed a half week longer .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .
and that is not to be expected in this case , " the diw found . euro 2004 : recession 's blow softened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel industry hopes the presidential suites are booked longer the organizers of the euro 2004 in portugal also saw the soccer event as an economic opportunity .
around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match . " we produced our largest advertising campaign ever , " said antonio padeira , director of portugal 's national tourism institute , itp .
" the slogan was : the post-match time is the best part of the match .
our ads showed a modern portugal with numerous holiday destinations .
they put tourism at the center .
soccer hardly appeared .
just enough so that the ads could be connected with the championships . " the strategy worked .
on average , they stayed a half week longer .
that just may be the modest goal german hoteliers want to achieve after the world cup 2006 . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is … german tourism with a million foreign visitors expected for the 2006 world cup soccer games , and another 40 million television viewers globally , the german tourism industry is eager to promote curry sausages and the cologne cathedral .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms . " we expect we can open at least one chapter of negotiations in june , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .
and that is not to be expected in this case , " the diw found . euro 2004 : recession 's blow softened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotel industry hopes the presidential suites are booked longer the organizers of the euro 2004 in portugal also saw the soccer event as an economic opportunity .
around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match . " we produced our largest advertising campaign ever , " said antonio padeira , director of portugal 's national tourism institute , itp .
" the slogan was : the post-match time is the best part of the match .
our ads showed a modern portugal with numerous holiday destinations .
they put tourism at the center .
soccer hardly appeared .
just enough so that the ads could be connected with the championships . " the strategy worked .
on average , they stayed a half week longer .
that just may be the modest goal german hoteliers want to achieve after the world cup 2006 . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de and the winner is … german tourism with a million foreign visitors expected for the 2006 world cup soccer games , and another 40 million television viewers globally , the german tourism industry is eager to promote curry sausages and the cologne cathedral .

however the total number of right-wing extremists had declined marginally from 40,700 to 39,000 because of a drop in the numbers of two of three right-wing parties , the deutsche volksunion -lrb- german people 's union -rrb- and the republicans , the paper reported . highlighting the threat posed by these groups , a politician in berlin 's regional assembly who is of turkish origin was seriously injured in berlin on friday after being attacked by two men who called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party politician giyasettin sayan giyasettin sayan of the left party suffered head injuries and bruising after he was struck by a bottle in a street in his lichtenberg ward in the east of the capital . police slow to react , politician says social democratic parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who is half indian , has publicly said that he would not travel to certain parts of berlin at night , further fuelling the debate that has started about labeling certain areas in eastern germany " no-go " zones for dark-skinned foreigners . in the bild am sonntag , edathy said that quite often , police are too slow to react to incidents with a potentially racist background . " there are cases in which the police do n't act quickly enough , " he said .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms . " we expect we can open at least one chapter of negotiations in june , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .

in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match . " we produced our largest advertising campaign ever , " said antonio padeira , director of portugal 's national tourism institute , itp .
" the slogan was : the post-match time is the best part of the match .
our ads showed a modern portugal with numerous holiday destinations .
they put tourism at the center .
soccer hardly appeared .
just enough so that the ads could be connected with the championships . " the strategy worked .
on average , they stayed a half week longer .

however the total number of right-wing extremists had declined marginally from 40,700 to 39,000 because of a drop in the numbers of two of three right-wing parties , the deutsche volksunion -lrb- german people 's union -rrb- and the republicans , the paper reported . highlighting the threat posed by these groups , a politician in berlin 's regional assembly who is of turkish origin was seriously injured in berlin on friday after being attacked by two men who called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party politician giyasettin sayan giyasettin sayan of the left party suffered head injuries and bruising after he was struck by a bottle in a street in his lichtenberg ward in the east of the capital . police slow to react , politician says social democratic parliamentarian sebastian edathy , who is half indian , has publicly said that he would not travel to certain parts of berlin at night , further fuelling the debate that has started about labeling certain areas in eastern germany " no-go " zones for dark-skinned foreigners . in the bild am sonntag , edathy said that quite often , police are too slow to react to incidents with a potentially racist background . " there are cases in which the police do n't act quickly enough , " he said .
" complaints and phone calls are sometimes not taken seriously enough . " edathy called for police to place a higher priority on dealing with right-wing extremism when training staff . bad news for world cup visitors ? concern at the possibility of racial violence has been increasing ahead of the world cup scheduled to start on june 9 , following news of several racist attacks in berlin and eastern germany in recent weeks . some observers fear that neo-nazis will try to exploit the event by holding demonstrations to spread their ideas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say they ca n't ensure safety at demos such as this one during the world cup speaking to news magazine der spiegel , the head of germany 's police union , konrad freiburg , appealed to authorities not to permit any demonstrations close to stadiums where world cup matches will be played . one right-wing rally is already expected to take place in leipzig on june 21 when iran will be playing angola .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.05.2006 happiness is danish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danes are happier than most life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?
the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .

how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?
i do not believe it , " zola wrote .
" it promised truth , and the question is to know if we will ever make happiness with truth .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms . " we expect we can open at least one chapter of negotiations in june , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's reform efforts wane turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story .
-lrb- march 8 , 2006 -rrb- relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .

but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .

yet portugal 's experience in 2004 was slightly different . over a million soccer-crazy supporters are supposed to give germany 's domestic economy a significant boost during this summer 's world cup .
at least , that has been the quiet hope of politicians and the tourism sector .
the world 's largest sporting event should not be a one-off occurrence for visitors . " we have a huge opportunity to show germany is not just a soccer country but a tourist destination , " klaus laepple , president of the german tourism industry association , said in march . this week , though , the german economic research institute diw released a report that said the upcoming world cup soccer championships will have a negligible impact on the domestic economy , which has been suffering by weak demand at home for years .
the think tank 's report was sober in its analysis , having burst the dreams about long-term economic benefits . " but that -lrb- an economic recovery -rrb- will only happen if the world cup leads to a sharp change in consumption and investment behavior .

around the country , ten new stadiums were erected at a total cost of 650 million euros .
seemingly a large sum , but to put it into perspective , the stade de france in paris , built for the 1998 world cup , cost more than that alone . the federal government and the country 's large clubs from lisbon and porto footed two-thirds of the bill .
the municipalities had to come up with the rest , a large burden that is still on the backs of the cities loule and faro , who have no first division soccer teams to fill up the venues . nevertheless , the benefits of the european championships were felt .
in 2003 , the economy had shrunk 1.1 percent .
in 2004 , it could expand by 1.2 percent . " it was very important .
at the time , portugal was in a recession and euro 2004 helped soften the blow by creating over 40,000 jobs , " said economics professor victor martins from lisbon university , who was asked to compile a report for the government . the tourist industry suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc porto got a new soccer stadium for the euro 2004 what seemingly should have profited most from a large sporting event like the european championships was the hotel branch .
but counter-intuitively , room occupancy rates fell in 2004 , but regionally , the differences were great .
the north , porto and lisbon could book increases ; the vacation paradise , the algarve , dropped off so badly that it skewed the statistic .
apparently , the potential chaos of the tournament scared off the usual clientele . importantly though , vacationers did not just pack up their bags and fly straight home after the final match .

" there is a sense of urgency and it is now the time for turkey to regain the momentum of reforms , and enhance rule of law , human rights and freedoms , " rehn told reporters in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partner or member state ?
" by speeding up the reform process , we can avoid negative repercussions in the negotiation process , " he said after talks with visiting turkish chief negotiator ali babacan , who is also economy minister . rehn did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be . european opposition hindering turkey 's progress according to a survey sponsored by the european commission and published in december , 55 percent of eu citizens are opposed to turkey joining the bloc . countries like austria , cyprus and greece , and to a lesser extent germany , are also against bringing a poor mainly-muslim state in the 25-member union . brussels and ankara are still trying to start the long process of detailed negotiations on 35 subjects , known as chapters , to bring turkish laws into line with eu norms .

" there are cases in which the police do n't act quickly enough , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2006 a life between drugs , work and hierarchy for german prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very little is known about life behind bars in germany germany 's 200 prisons hold more than 60,000 inmates and a further 14,000 awaiting trials .
apart from stray reports of drug rackets , almost nothing is known about life behind the high walls and barbed wire . high gray walls topped with barbed wire , a watch tower every couple of 100 meters , a stringent security check before you enter and endlessly long corridors and series of steel doors before you reach the inmates - cologne 's main prison fits the bleak image of slammers all over the world . for inmates the day begins at six in the morning .
breakfast is followed by school , training or work and the grind is interrupted only by an half-hour lunch break .
prisoners can train to be hairdressers , seamstresses or cleaners .
nobody has to know later that they finished school or learned professional skills in a prison . " life is actually good here " 23-year-old nathalie , who does n't want to say why she 's in the prison , said life here is n't bad .
her cell includes a table , chair , a television and cassette recorder . " we even have a toilet and wash basin in our cells , " she said .
" life is actually quite good here . " all inmates in the prison have to do some kind of work .
andi , 33 , who works in an inspection center for electrical gadgets , works with a typewriter since computers are n't allowed in the prison for security reasons . " this is where we keep track of the radios and televisions that inmates bring in and want to have in their cells , " he said .
" the gadgets are then sent out to a dealer and checked for illegal things like arms , drugs , money or secret information .
if they 're fine , they are brought back in and i seal them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners have to do mandatory work in germany the prisoners can also work in the kitchen , laundry , garbage disposal or in workshops where large external companies also commission work .
the inmates are paid much less than what they would get for the same work outside .
the maximum wage is about 300 euros -lrb- $ 385.8 -rrb- a month . " they have to save a large part of the wages for the time after their release , " said angela wozlaw , deputy head of the cologne prison , adding that they can use a small part for shopping . but wozlaw also said that the prisoners could only order what they wanted on a list and the items are then brought from outside . drugs a part of priso n life other than work and school , there 's not much else the prisoners can do in their free time .
they can use a library or do sports for an hour and a half each week .
some of them meet their lawyer . each prisoner is allowed to receive visitors for half an hour four times a month .
the small visiting room with wooden tables is outfitted with mirrors in each corner to allow prison officials to monitor the meetings .
despite that the visiting room carries the risk of drugs being smuggled in , wozlaw said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates only start taking drugs in prison " i would be lying if i said we can prevent that , " she said .
" it 's just not true .
we could only do that if we completely sealed off the prison and stopped all human contact , " she said .
" for instance some visitors smuggle drugs in their mouth and it 's passed on through a welcome kiss .
women who come to the prison often hide drugs in their lower bodies . " even though it 's not spoken of , drugs are a part of life in prison , said wozlaw , adding that for many the prison is their first contact point with drugs . drug dealers are often the most respected persons in the pecking order among prisoners , wozlaw said . " we 've concluded that sexual abuse and rape ranks at the bottom of prisoner hierarchy , but rapists are still a notch above child molesters , " she said . bei n g treated as huma n s for first time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he be able to lead a normal life once he 's released ?
prison official peter piontek saidthat scuffles and fights among inmates are a regular occurrence .
as punishment , inmates are often confined to their cells for a week . many of them learn to eat with fork and knife in the prison for the first time in their lives and for others it 's also the first time that they learn to stick to rules and have a fixed routine . " for many it 's really the first place where they are seen as humans and not just as scum on the streets , " piontek said . silke oppermann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister , unions disagree on germany 's crime level crime rates in germany are down and the police are more effective , making the country one of the safest places in the world .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .
" you are born with the ability to be happy , just like being born with certain types of intelligence , " he said .
" however , it is impossible to tell how far that can go . " happy challenges but is constant happiness the only path to a fulfilled life ?
the irish writer george bernard shaw did n't think so .
" a lifetime of happiness ! " he wrote .
" no man alive could bear it : it would be hell on earth . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whistle while you work veenhoven does n't disagree .
" in order to be really happy in life , we also need difficulties , " he said .
" only in overcoming challenges do we maintain our physical and mental fitness , and that keeps us feeling good . " while every day may not be a challenge , humans need to stay busy to maintain happiness .
although research does not hold that a job is necessary to appreciate life , the findings show that some level of interesting and stimulating activity is a must . the truth about happiness happiness research also does away with urban myths - like the belief that happiness in the future depends on forgetting the past .
veenhoven said research findings on life satisfaction show the contrary .
" the happiest people are not ' ego-defensive ' , " he said .
" they do not romanticize their past or their mistakes , but face them . " happiness research may be new as a scientific field , but the search for life 's quintessence is hardly so .
nearly every writer and philosopher from every age can be quoted on the subject - from aristotle , who called the ability to live happily " an inward power of the soul , " to the french writer emile zola .
at the turn of the 19th century , he had an uncanny premonition of the academic field that would take people 's inner-most desires and translate them into statistics and charts . " did science promise happiness ?
i do not believe it , " zola wrote .

the results are surprising . is there such a thing as true happiness ?
how can you achieve it ?
and once you 've got it , how do you keep the good thing going ?
these are the questions that everyone asks themselves in the course of their lives - including scientists , who have taken the inquiry one step further . in the early 1980s , researchers opened up a new field of scientific research on the subjective appreciation of life .
it 's an interdisciplinary subject that not only integrates aspects of psychology and sociology , but also economics and environmental studies .
many universities even have institutes set up to do nothing more than find out what makes us smile and laugh out loud . feeling fine in the state of denmark sociologist ruut veenhoven from the erasmus university rotterdam has been posing questions regarding human happiness since his early days in college .
at the end of the 1990s , he launched the " world database of happiness " on the internet .
the portal is an ongoing register of current research findings in the field , accessible by all and full of open secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : couples are on the path to happiness one of the findings is that the happiest people on earth live in denmark .
asked to rank their satisfaction with life " on the whole " on a scale from 1 to 10 , the danes gave it an 8.2 on average .
down at the bottom of the list is tanzania with 3.2 .
germany is pushing the top guys with 7.2 happiness points on average . married with kids ? professor veenhoven believes that the first step towards happiness in life is living in the right country .
the second step is finding a partner .
statistics show that happiness booms right after marriage .
although that marital bliss will ebb out eventually , satisfaction levels never hit the depths that singles will see - unless children enter the picture , that is . contrary to popular belief , the pitter-patter of little feet does not bring joy to our lives .
children actually make happiness statistics drop to oblivion , never to return to their previous levels again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for working women , kids can be less than bliss veenhoven 's analysis is sober : " children have a constant negative effect on human happiness and the quality of marriage . " this dissatisfaction affects women who try to balance the dual burden of children and career the most .
parents may be consoled by the fact that the happiness curve goes up with age .
when the stress of parenting and job begins to wane , those in their 50s and 60s will start to enjoy their lives again . different country , different key but who needs these statistics anyway ?
" poor countries do n't need happiness research , " said ruut veenhoven .
" the path to happiness there is pretty clear . " instead , he said , it is the wealthy countries that have troubles , because there is no obvious reason for their citizens to be unhappy .
fifty percent of the problems there lie in the human psyche .
in the best of all worlds , veenhoven said , there would be no external reason for unhappiness .
" if we lived in paradise , all of our problems would be purely psychological . " happiness genes vs. therapy but what should rich , married , childless danes do if they still are n't beaming all over ? " they should ask themselves a few questions , " veenhoven said .
" ' what is wrong with me ?
how is my psychological health ? have i chosen the right way of life ?
can i make something better out of my life ' ? " those who ca n't find the answers for themselves , he said , make their way to a psychologist for help . but veenhoven also admitted that some people have an easier time finding happiness than others .

that is those communities blighted by the impact of second homes .
the affordable rural housing commission has answered that call with a report looking at all the issues .
the suggestion that a local impact tax on second homes should be considered grabbed the headlines , but it also called for enhanced planning powers , more affordable homes to be built and more money .
paradise for those that can afford it - a paradox for those that can not .
for many born and bred in salcombe , living there is increasingly not an option .
no less than 40 % of properties in salcombe are second homes .
nowhere is the need for affordable housing more acute .
new development it is hoped that a new development will alleviate the problem .
of the 43 properties to be built more than three quarters are for local people , who simply can not afford a home of their own .
naomi langdon was caught in that trap in her home village of south brent .
she and her partner were living with her parents : " we were quite desperate really and very unhappy .
" obviously we were sharing one bedroom and we had no privacy , " she said .
but thanks to an affordable housing scheme they were given the key to the door of their own home .
" i feel great now , " she continued .
" originally we asked for a two-bedroom which they turned us down .
" we thought we had missed the boat but in january 2006 they did contact us and say we can offer you a three-bedroom , if you are still interested .
so it was a double whammy . "
call for affordable homes this week the affordable rural housing commission made detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring more developments like the one that enabled naomi to get on the housing ladder .
the commission 's report called for 11,000 affordable new homes to be built each year .
alan robinson , the strategic operations manager for south hams district council welcomed the report .
" the really good news from our point of view is that it puts rural affordable housing high up on the national agenda and hopefully it will give government the opportunity to look at the recommendations and to start to really address the problems that residents of the south hams are actually facing on a daily basis . "
best practice the report cited a development at east allington as best practice .
one third of the homes are being sold at market value , two thirds are affordable housing aimed at local residents , either for rent or shared ownership .
david norman from the tor homes housing association explained how it helped people trying to get a foot on the housing ladder .
" they are fairly low-cost , in the region of £ 140,000 to £ 160,000 to start with , but we sell them on shared ownership terms where people can part-buy and part rent and then they buy more shares as their circumstances change in the future and that makes the overall cost of ownership about two thirds of what it would be if they had bought their homes on the open market . "
regional problem its not just the south hams .
in north devon the average property price five years ago was £ 83,000 .
in 2006 it is almost £ 220,000 .
and in torridge it is estimated that 500 affordable new homes are needed every year .
currently they are managing only 12 .
the situation was not helped when plans for a much lauded social housing development in high bickington were turned down because they breached the district plan , which discourages development outside village boundaries .
david brown , the chairman of the trust behind the development said the decision beggared belief .
" the day before we got the decision ruth kelly had stood and said affordable housing was her number one priority and yet here we are offering to build 36 affordable homes in this area and share them with our neighbouring villages and it is turned down . "
blow to locals the decision came as a real blow to newly wed seb cummings who was hoping to move out of his parents home in the village .
" it really was our own and only opportunity in many ways for the foreseeable future .
" the prospect of being able to raise a family in this village , this community where i have grown up , which is near both our families that is not a realistic option for us now . "
however if the affordable rural housing commission 's recommendations were adopted there might be a change of heart , according to one its members , david fursdon .
" i think we have made recommendations about the planning inspectors and how they should buy into the whole process and i think we have a fair chance that in the future inspectors are actually going to have a different view , but i ca n't absolutely guarantee it . "
the government has said it will look carefully at the commission 's recommendations about the location of new social housing as part of its spending review politics show the politics show wants to hear from you .

the affordable rural housing commission has answered that call with a report looking at all the issues .
the suggestion that a local impact tax on second homes should be considered grabbed the headlines , but it also called for enhanced planning powers , more affordable homes to be built and more money .
paradise for those that can afford it - a paradox for those that can not .
for many born and bred in salcombe , living there is increasingly not an option .
no less than 40 % of properties in salcombe are second homes .
nowhere is the need for affordable housing more acute .
new development it is hoped that a new development will alleviate the problem .
of the 43 properties to be built more than three quarters are for local people , who simply can not afford a home of their own .
naomi langdon was caught in that trap in her home village of south brent .
she and her partner were living with her parents : " we were quite desperate really and very unhappy .
" obviously we were sharing one bedroom and we had no privacy , " she said .
but thanks to an affordable housing scheme they were given the key to the door of their own home .
" i feel great now , " she continued .
" originally we asked for a two-bedroom which they turned us down .
" we thought we had missed the boat but in january 2006 they did contact us and say we can offer you a three-bedroom , if you are still interested .
so it was a double whammy . "
call for affordable homes this week the affordable rural housing commission made detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring more developments like the one that enabled naomi to get on the housing ladder .
the commission 's report called for 11,000 affordable new homes to be built each year .
alan robinson , the strategic operations manager for south hams district council welcomed the report .
" the really good news from our point of view is that it puts rural affordable housing high up on the national agenda and hopefully it will give government the opportunity to look at the recommendations and to start to really address the problems that residents of the south hams are actually facing on a daily basis . "
best practice the report cited a development at east allington as best practice .
one third of the homes are being sold at market value , two thirds are affordable housing aimed at local residents , either for rent or shared ownership .
david norman from the tor homes housing association explained how it helped people trying to get a foot on the housing ladder .
" they are fairly low-cost , in the region of £ 140,000 to £ 160,000 to start with , but we sell them on shared ownership terms where people can part-buy and part rent and then they buy more shares as their circumstances change in the future and that makes the overall cost of ownership about two thirds of what it would be if they had bought their homes on the open market . "
regional problem its not just the south hams .
in north devon the average property price five years ago was £ 83,000 .
in 2006 it is almost £ 220,000 .
and in torridge it is estimated that 500 affordable new homes are needed every year .
currently they are managing only 12 .
the situation was not helped when plans for a much lauded social housing development in high bickington were turned down because they breached the district plan , which discourages development outside village boundaries .
david brown , the chairman of the trust behind the development said the decision beggared belief .
" the day before we got the decision ruth kelly had stood and said affordable housing was her number one priority and yet here we are offering to build 36 affordable homes in this area and share them with our neighbouring villages and it is turned down . "
blow to locals the decision came as a real blow to newly wed seb cummings who was hoping to move out of his parents home in the village .
" it really was our own and only opportunity in many ways for the foreseeable future .
" the prospect of being able to raise a family in this village , this community where i have grown up , which is near both our families that is not a realistic option for us now . "
however if the affordable rural housing commission 's recommendations were adopted there might be a change of heart , according to one its members , david fursdon .
" i think we have made recommendations about the planning inspectors and how they should buy into the whole process and i think we have a fair chance that in the future inspectors are actually going to have a different view , but i ca n't absolutely guarantee it . "
the government has said it will look carefully at the commission 's recommendations about the location of new social housing as part of its spending review politics show the politics show wants to hear from you .

"
a year ago last may , first minister jack mcconnell visited malawi to re-energise the links between out two countries - a historic bond that stretches back to dr david livingstone .
since that visit , much work has been done to cement the new relationship .
in november last year , the first minister and president mutharika signed a co-agreement between our two countries .
over the coming years , we will work together to strengthen malawi 's education and health systems , its civic governance and civil society and we will explore ways we can help grow a sustainable economy in a country who 's gdp is around the same size as falkirk 's .
one of the main purposes of my trip is to meet with the government of malawi to review the progress already made on the agreement , and agree the implementation of the next phase .
i will also be seeing for myself the many challenges facing malawi 's development .
diseases such as malaria , tb and hiv / aids are a constant threat to the 12 million population .
' daily struggle ' it is a daily struggle to ensure that this landlocked country can provide enough food each year for its people , particularly when the rains are poor .
and while malawi 's young democracy is growing stronger each year , there is still much advice and support we can offer both government and civil society .
during my visit , i will meet with many of the scots who are already making a difference in malawi .
i will visit a school to see the mary 's meals programme in action .
this is run by scottish international relief and provides thousands of children with free school meals every day - for many this will be their only meal .
i hope to meet some of the scottish medical staff who give up their annual holidays to travel to malawi to work .
in the last year these doctors and midwives have trained 150 malawi nurses and midwives in life saving techniques - crucial in a country which has one of the world 's worst maternal and neo-natal death rates .
and i will visit the bandawe mission to pay my respects to the scottish missionaries buried there .
more than 100 years ago those brave men and women died while working in malawi , and their sacrifice is a constant reminder of the strong lasting bond between our two countries .
my week promises to be a busy one , and will cement even further the relationship between our two countries .
malawi and scotland may be thousands of miles apart but together we can build a better future . "

spanish construction group ferrovial currently has the airports group in its sights , but baa has rebuffed its £ 8.75bn offer as too low .
the sunday telegraph said the group would reveal its payout to investors in a defence document later this week .
baa - which operates seven uk airports including london 's heathrow , gatwick and stansted - declined to comment .
airports are currently being seen as popular investments because of a surge in air travel worldwide .
increased offer ?
experts widely predict that a higher offer for baa will be tabled by ferrovial or another bidder .

baa also recently rejected a 870-pence-per-share offer from a consortium led by goldman sachs .
since talk of a takeover emerged , baa has pledge to invest £ 9.5bn in upgrading its airports over the next 10 years as well as focusing on the growth potential of its assets .
the company has until 29 may to unveil its official defence against ferrovial 's bid .

john hutton confirmed he wanted to restore the link between pensions and earnings , as well as raise the pension age from 65 .
but he said the " number one problem " to resolve was how to encourage people to save more for retirement .
the long-awaited pensions white paper will be released later this week .
" the real problem in the uk pensions system right now is that people are n't saving enough for their own retirement , " mr hutton told bbc one 's sunday am .
" what we have really got to try to engineer is a situation where the state pension system can provide a new , proper , solid foundation on which it will always make it clear to people that it will be worth their while to save for their retirement . "
current estimates suggest almost 10 million people are not saving enough to provide for their retirement .
' no tax rises ' proposals to be revealed in the white paper would be of the " scale and magnitude " seen when the welfare state was reformed in the 1940s , mr hutton added .
pension plans should be tailored to be inclusive of people in all walks of life , not exclusive to some john mcfall chairman , treasury select committee however , the pensions secretary did stress that any changes would be affordable and gradual , and would not trigger a rise in taxes .
most of the planned changes would be based on the recommendations of lord turner 's pensions commission , mr hutton confirmed .

however , the group warned that any scheme should be simple and cheap to run .

chairman john mcfall said : " pension plans should be tailored to be inclusive of people in all walks of life , not exclusive to some .
" they should be accessible , simple and straightforward , " he added .
pension plans should also be " more ready-to-wear and less made-to-measure , " offering suitable generic guidance for everyone who might be interested , mr mcfall said .
lord turner 's proposals that people should be enrolled automatically if their employers do not already provide an occupational pension scheme also won support , as did calls for compulsory employer contributions .
without these features , the committee argues , the npss would be no more effective than the government 's previous initiative , the stakeholder pension .
the consumers ' association which ? has also come out in favour of the npss .
spokesman mick mcateer said : " people on lower-to-average incomes will really benefit from npss .
" these are precisely the people that the government has pledged to help out of the pensions black hole , and who must be encouraged to save if the pensions crisis is to be solved . "

deputy council leader andy smith said : " our pleas for £ 5m funding from the government has so far failed to be successful , despite our warnings that the sea wall was in grave danger .

" concrete blocks have been placed against the bowed sea wall to try and stave off any further damage and we will monitor the situation after every high tide . "
he said the council would next week try and build up the defences , but these would only be stop-gap measures .
