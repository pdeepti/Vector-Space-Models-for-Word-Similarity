program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 26.12.2006 german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is committed to phasing out its 17 nuclear plants one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany . german energy giant enbw presented a rather unwelcome christmas gift to the government end of last week when it sought to transfer part of the life span of one of its more modern nuclear reactors to an older one which was due to shut down in 2009 under a six-year-old phase-out plan . enbw 's request provoked strong reactions over christmas , including a stern rebuff from environment minister sigmar gabriel .
but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .
but in view of skyrocketing electricity and heating bills that have angered germans this year , the tide appears to be slowly turning . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government plans new nuclear waste dump the german government , in its ongoing search for final storage locations for its nuclear waste , is considering constructing an atomic dump in the north-eastern state of saxony-anhalt , according to a german newspaper .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation .

in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 26.12.2006 german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is committed to phasing out its 17 nuclear plants one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany . german energy giant enbw presented a rather unwelcome christmas gift to the government end of last week when it sought to transfer part of the life span of one of its more modern nuclear reactors to an older one which was due to shut down in 2009 under a six-year-old phase-out plan . enbw 's request provoked strong reactions over christmas , including a stern rebuff from environment minister sigmar gabriel .
but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 26.12.2006 german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is committed to phasing out its 17 nuclear plants one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany . german energy giant enbw presented a rather unwelcome christmas gift to the government end of last week when it sought to transfer part of the life span of one of its more modern nuclear reactors to an older one which was due to shut down in 2009 under a six-year-old phase-out plan . enbw 's request provoked strong reactions over christmas , including a stern rebuff from environment minister sigmar gabriel .
but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .
but in view of skyrocketing electricity and heating bills that have angered germans this year , the tide appears to be slowly turning . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government plans new nuclear waste dump the german government , in its ongoing search for final storage locations for its nuclear waste , is considering constructing an atomic dump in the north-eastern state of saxony-anhalt , according to a german newspaper .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 26.12.2006 german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is committed to phasing out its 17 nuclear plants one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany . german energy giant enbw presented a rather unwelcome christmas gift to the government end of last week when it sought to transfer part of the life span of one of its more modern nuclear reactors to an older one which was due to shut down in 2009 under a six-year-old phase-out plan . enbw 's request provoked strong reactions over christmas , including a stern rebuff from environment minister sigmar gabriel .
but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .

" more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 26.12.2006 german energy giant reopens debate on nuclear phase-out plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is committed to phasing out its 17 nuclear plants one of germany 's leading energy companies wants to extend the lifetime of one of its nuclear plants in a move that anti-nuclear campaigners describe as an attack on plans to phase out nuclear energy in germany . german energy giant enbw presented a rather unwelcome christmas gift to the government end of last week when it sought to transfer part of the life span of one of its more modern nuclear reactors to an older one which was due to shut down in 2009 under a six-year-old phase-out plan . enbw 's request provoked strong reactions over christmas , including a stern rebuff from environment minister sigmar gabriel .
but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .
but in view of skyrocketing electricity and heating bills that have angered germans this year , the tide appears to be slowly turning . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government plans new nuclear waste dump the german government , in its ongoing search for final storage locations for its nuclear waste , is considering constructing an atomic dump in the north-eastern state of saxony-anhalt , according to a german newspaper .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .
germans still overwhelmingly back a nuclear-free energy policy with a strong emphasis on renewable energies .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .

in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .
" quite obviously german energy companies want to undo the accord they signed in 2000 .
this must not be tolerated by politics . " chancellor angela merkel is indeed increasingly unhappy with the plan to shut down all 17 nuclear plants in germany by 2021 .
in the light of rising energy prices and germany ’ s huge dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , she wants a broader energy mix .
she believes germany should use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years . but anti-nuclear campaigners say nuclear plants are primarily money machines for the energy industry .
enbw ’ s ceo utz claasen defends his company ’ s move saying it ’ s perfectly in line with legal provisions . " we abide by common international standards regarding the lifetime of nuclear reactors , " claasen said .
" and what ’ s more important we do not violate the stipulations laid out in the nuclear accord between government and industry . " eu may urge rethink on nuclear energy social democrat environment minister sigmar gabriel is an opponent of nuclear energy .
but he has grudgingly admitted that he can not throw out the application so easily . he is likely to come under added pressure from a european union review of nuclear energy which is due to be published in early january .
parts of the report have already been leaked to the press and stress that nuclear power is important if the eu is to meet its ambitious climate protection policy goals . volker hoff , a liberal member of the european parliament from germany also argues that stopping nuclear power makes no sense anymore . " it ’ s foolish to adhere to our national phase-out plan and at the same time promote an eu energy strategy that includes nuclear power , " hoff said .
" in that way we are forcing our neighbors to increase their nuclear energy production for the entire eu to be able to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets . " germany generates one third of its energy needs from nuclear power .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

but the social democrat minister ’ s word may not have been the last on the issue as conservative chancellor angela merkel is a staunch advocate of nuclear energy and now hopes for political tailwind from the european commission . greens expect backpedaling on nuclear phase-out germany 's nuclear phase-out plan was adopted by the previous red-green government , and chancellor angela merkel ’ s current government of social democrats and conservatives have decided to leave it untouched for now . but senior members of the opposition environmentalist greens such as fritz kuhn believe that enbw ’ s move is a thinly veiled attempt to salvage its old reactor beyond 2009 .
they hope , kuhn argues , that merkel ’ s cdu would then be stronger after general elections and could finally ditch the nuclear withdrawal plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biblis nuclear power plant in germany " it ’ s an absurd idea to transfer part of the remaining lifetime of a modern reactor to an older one , " kuhn said .

but the effects of the giant waves are still being felt . remembrances are being held across asia today on the two-year anniversary of the indian ocean tsunami whose devastating waves killed 230,000 people across the region and left millions homeless . many parts of the region are still struggling to recover from the catastrophe , even as new floods and landslides in indonesia are again forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes . billions of dollars in aid donations which poured in from around the world , and help from foreign governments , including germany , are helping regions rebuild their infrastructure , although accusations have surfaced alleging some reconstruction money has been wasted . a look back on december 26 , 2004 , a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the shore of the indonesian province aceh triggered giant waves that fanned out across the indian ocean .
the tsunami took nearly 230,000 lives and left around two million people homeless in 13 nations , including indonesia , india , sri lanka , thailand , malaysia and bangladesh . the tsunami extended as far as the african continent , causing destruction in somalia , kenya and tanzania , as well as on madagascar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , aced still had much clearing up to do many of the survivors lost their children ; most lost their homes .
entire infrastructures , including fresh water supplies and power lines , were wiped away . after seeing the images of the tsunami 's destruction on television , and still warmed by the holiday season , governments and people around the world pledged an unprecedented amount of money to help the victims - nearly $ 14 billion . german aid germans donated around 670 million euros -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- .
those donations and the many others given to international organizations were initially spent on emergency care , including medicine , food , tents and blankets . german organizations working in aceh say reconstruction efforts have included rebuilding or repairing hospitals , for instance .
half of the 120,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt in the region , and 750 new schools have gone up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan woman mourns the loss of her two children in the tsunami though much progress has been made , reconstruction is likely to last another three years , said christoph ernesti , a german relief worker who traveled through the region in november to review the situation . " we are now focusing our efforts are long-term perspectives for the people here , " ernesti said . those efforts include helping to recultivate rice fields which were saturated with salt during the tsunami .
sewing co-operatives have been established to generate income . christoph müller of the german red cross is impressed by aid efforts .
" aceh is booming - in the building business and other areas - and that is primarily due to the humanitarian aid , " he said .
" but that wo n't go on forever . " more money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivor children asking for donations in january 2005 the german ministry for economic cooperation and development is currently providing 44 million euros to rebuild medical facilities .
a large portion of that money has been spent to construct a new hospital designed to be safe from floodwaters in the province 's capital , banda aceh . aid from the german government is also being spent on apartment-reconstruction programs in which future residents help to rebuild their homes themselves - laying everything from cinderblock to pouring cement . other aid goes toward providing boots to fishermen , while also helping them to set up businesses . impressed by the progress she saw during her visit to aceh , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul increased the development aid budget for aceh by 20 milllion euros to a total of 185 million euros , which should last until 2009 . others are less optimistic about the progress .
in aceh , hundreds of thousands of survivors still have no permanent homes or jobs , with many facing the prospect of being refugees for years to come . aid money mismanagement ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai woman lost her home furthermore , some estimate that only one-third of the promised aid has been distributed to all the countries affected by the tsunami , and much of that has been lost to corruption , mismanagement , political squabbles and bureaucracy . seven western countries have submitted a joint complaint to thai police about the disappearance of an estimated one million dollars in donations . the complaint - dated november 22 and signed by the ambassadors to the bangkok-based embassies of finland , france , germany , the netherlands , sweden , britain and the united states - alleged that more than 60 percent of about 60 million baht -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- in funds collected from their citizens for tsunami relief were " wasted and disguised as traveling and other miscellaneous expenses , " the nation newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources . the tsunami killed an estimated 5,300 people , half of them foreign tourists , in thailand 's provinces of phuket , phang nha and krabi - all popular resort destinations . sri lanka on the edge relief efforts in hard-hit sri lanka , where 31,000 people died and another million were left homeless , have been sluggish , largely due to that island nation 's ongoing civil conflict .
in contrast to aceh , where the disaster brought about the end of a three-decade insurgency , sri lanka 's conflict has heated up again and reconstruction and aid work have been hampered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's tsunami death toll was nearly 170,000 a resurgence in the two-decade civil war between government troops and tamil tiger rebels has forced thousands of tamils , including tsunami survivors , to flee homes and camps for the second time in two years . germany announced on sunday that it will not offer the sri lankan government new aid until the peace process in the country advances and has called on other nations to increase the pressure on colombo . the development ministry has redirected 19 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- originally earmarked for sri lanka to indonesia , the country hardest hit by the tsunami . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clinton calls for more aid for tsunami victims former us president bill clinton on monday pressed donors at a un conference in germany for more money to rebuild communities shattered by the south asian tsunami and create warning systems against future sea swells .

meanwhile , an actor 's daughter became the industry 's new darling , while a hotel heiress found her albums defaced .
here are some of the highlights - or lowlights - of 2006 in music .
take that make their comeback take that 's return saw gary barlow , jason orange , howard donald and mark owen back in the limelight with a comeback tour and new album .
but robbie williams elected not to join the party - a hologram of him took his place on tour .
by december the older , wiser foursome topped both the single and album charts for the first time in their career .
" it 's like a fairytale , " barlow cooed .
all saints also made a comeback as a mini-1990s revival took place .
first chart double for take that take that sign up for new album fans witness take that comeback the rise of lily allen lily allen stepped out from actor father keith 's shadow in 2006 with her single smile becoming one of the soundtracks to the summer .
her debut album alright , still - full of perky , witty songs about london life - picked up the first of what looks likely to be many awards when she was honoured at the digital music awards .
but behind her sing-song voice , the 21-year-old was not afraid of sharing her forthright views on fellow stars .
" they look like lap dancers as far as i 'm concerned , " she said of the pussycat dolls .
women top list of music 's coolest lily allen wins web music award lily allen scores number one hit farewell smash hits and top of the pops over 25 ?
think you 're still in touch with the kids ? 2006 saw two closures which reminded us the music industry simply is not what it was .
in february , smash hits magazine closed - leaving thirtysomethings crying into their black type tea towels .
then the bbc finally took top of the pops off life support , after a year spent withering away on bbc two .
aged djs and tapes of 70s dancers were wheeled out - reminding younger viewers just why the show had been axed .
fans say goodbye to top of the pops ' i was in totp 's audience 43 times ! '

jon cruddas says labour can be rebuilt from the grassroots but must change its ways and reconnect with the electorate .
figures show labour 's membership fell slightly in 2005 to 198,026 , half the number of members in 1997 .
