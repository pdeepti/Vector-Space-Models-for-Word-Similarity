instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration . " sixty years after the war there is n't enough being done to teach young people the extent of the immeasurable suffering that was caused in the name of this symbol , " she said . barbara collins -lrb- jb / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yad vashem to honor german wwii officer german wehrmacht officer karl plagge has been called " better than oskar schindler " for saving jewish lives during world war ii .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration . " sixty years after the war there is n't enough being done to teach young people the extent of the immeasurable suffering that was caused in the name of this symbol , " she said . barbara collins -lrb- jb / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yad vashem to honor german wwii officer german wehrmacht officer karl plagge has been called " better than oskar schindler " for saving jewish lives during world war ii .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .

" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "

" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .

" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

during its crackdown on homosexuals the nazi regime began 100,000 legal proceedings , followed by 45,000 sentences under a criminal law that endured until 1969 . after the war , 44,231 sentences were handed down against gays in then west germany . legal discrimination of homosexual men ended in 1994 , four years after german unification .
east germany had abolished its anti-gay legislation in 1968 . although there is no timeframe for the erection of the monument for murdered homosexuals , gay rights groups have urged the government to act speedily , emphasizing that the purging of gays between 1933 and 1945 was without precedent in history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration .

" opponents could be child soldiers " german ministers have not explicitly ruled out sending peacekeepers to congo , which has seen an upsurge in rebel and militia violence in the volatile east this month .
but many have expressed reservations . deputy defense minister christian schmidt told daily berliner zeitung this week that in light of its historic experience , germany placed high demands on its troop deployments and that these could probably not be met in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of child soldiers are believed to be recruited in rebel congo militia groups " you do n't know who the opponent is or whether there is one , " schmidt said .
" it could also be that the opponents are child soldiers , " he added . federal commissioner for military affairs , reinhold robbe said germany could only send a few specialists to congo . " we 're already involved in various parts of the world ; the german army is already overburdened . " however , schmidt has suggested that germany could possibly send more soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the balkans if france wanted to be part of peacekeeping in congo . deteriorating security the present debate was triggered by a united nations request for eu troops to reinforce the 15,700-strong un force in congo , the world body 's largest and costliest mission , which is trying to beef up security in the lead-up to general elections due by the end of june . the security situation has worsened after un troops stepped up operations against congolese , ugandan and rwandan rebel groups in congo 's east .
the offensive has now taken the lives of at least 20 peacekeepers . the 1998 - 2003 civil war in this vast central african nation the size of europe claimed the lives of at least four million people . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president seeks " real partnership " with africa german president horst köhler called sunday for a " true partnership " between the west and africa as he kicked off an initiative to solve the continent 's urgent problems .

" an endless kiss " norbert radermacher , president of the jury that named ingar dragset and michael elmgreen winners of the bidding competition , said the monument would remember the victims in a " direct but subtle way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust monument in central berlin is a popular site the concrete sculpture takes its cue from the holocaust monument designed by star architect peter eisenman .
it expands on the gray cement slab theme , by turning it into a kind of house . radermacher , added that the structure , which appears cool and distant at first glance actually conceals an intimate aspect - it will have an oblique window featuring a black and white video of " an endless kiss between two men .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world honors the victims and survivors of the holocaust on january 27 jan .
27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .
it 's another step on our quest for humanity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wannsee museum presents the documents of horror the wannsee museum has revamped its exhibit on the notorious 1942 conference which sealed the fate of europe 's jews .

do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .

can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .

that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

" an endless kiss " norbert radermacher , president of the jury that named ingar dragset and michael elmgreen winners of the bidding competition , said the monument would remember the victims in a " direct but subtle way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust monument in central berlin is a popular site the concrete sculpture takes its cue from the holocaust monument designed by star architect peter eisenman .
it expands on the gray cement slab theme , by turning it into a kind of house . radermacher , added that the structure , which appears cool and distant at first glance actually conceals an intimate aspect - it will have an oblique window featuring a black and white video of " an endless kiss between two men . " persecution and killing during nazi regime the decision to go ahead with the project was taken three years after the german parliament agreed to set up a memorial for murdered gays that would also serve as a visible stand against intolerance and isolation . germany 's lower house of parliament in 2000 formally apologized to gays persecuted under the nazi regime , which held power from 1933 to 1945 . between 5,000 and 10,000 homosexuals were deported to concentration camps .
during its crackdown on homosexuals the nazi regime began 100,000 legal proceedings , followed by 45,000 sentences under a criminal law that endured until 1969 . after the war , 44,231 sentences were handed down against gays in then west germany . legal discrimination of homosexual men ended in 1994 , four years after german unification .
east germany had abolished its anti-gay legislation in 1968 . although there is no timeframe for the erection of the monument for murdered homosexuals , gay rights groups have urged the government to act speedily , emphasizing that the purging of gays between 1933 and 1945 was without precedent in history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .

" " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior .

" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 press review : europe concerned over hamas win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european papers debated which was is palestine headed as politicians call on hamas to recognize israel and denounce terrorism , the international press is concerned about the prospects for peace in the middle east and who is to blame for hamas ' success . vienna 's standard found plenty of people to blame for hamas ' electoral victory , " the palestinian authority under the corrupt leadership of yassir arafat first of all ; the eu commission , which pumped money into gaza and ramallah without ensuring the principles of good governance ; and finally israel 's government , which supported the islamists during the first intifada at the end of the 80s to weaken arafat 's plo . " the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity .

" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .

should it continue its annual generous cash injections into the palestinian territories even if a " terror group " is in power ? as the world absorbed the ramifications of hamas ' surprise victory in this week 's palestinian polls and leaders unanimously called on the radical islamic group to renounce violence , the european union was left increasingly questioning its own role as the region 's biggest financial backer . since 2003 , the eu has annually pumped about half a billion euros -lrb- $ 610 million yearly -rrb- in the palestinian territories , much of it towards fostering democracy and aiding social and environmental projects . but hamas 's defeat of the long-dominant fatah faction in wednesday 's parliamentary vote and its reaffirmation of its commitment to what it calls armed resistance to israeli occupation has cast doubt on future cash flows . though the eu has blacklisted hamas after it spearheaded a string of deadly attacks against israel since it was formed in the late 1980s , eu officials do maintain contacts with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group plays an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been a regular visitor to the middle east last month however eu foreign policy chief javier solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government . on thursday , the 35-member eu said in a statement that " it reiterates its position that there is no place in a political process for groups or individuals who advocate violence . " at the same time it said the eu was " ready to continue to support palestinian economic development and democratic state building . " germans question future financial aid but , in a stance echoed throughout europe , many are questioning the logic of continued channeling of funds to a region governed in future by a party that refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist . in germany , politicians from both parties in the governing grand coalition , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , expressed misgivings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians want hamas to renounce violence and recognize israel either hamas renounces violence and recognizes israel 's right to exist " or we 'll think about letting the finances dry up , " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the spd told daily berliner zeitung . " we ca n't give taxpayers ' money to such a government , " said elmar brok , a cdu member and head of the foreign council in the eu parliament . other politicians have underlined that hamas must fulfill the twin requirements of renouncing violence and recognizing israel 's existence before there can be further cooperation with the eu . in addition , hamas must formulate a concrete plan for disarming its various factions , others said , saying that future german future financial help to the region would hinge on the factor . hamas dependant on eu aid in a hint that the eu might consider continuing aid provided hamas stuck to a few basic guidelines , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said this week that " the most important thing is that we plan to work with any government if that government is prepared to work for peace , by peaceful means . " " and if the government follows the two treaties that we have and the principles it contains , " she added . the two treaties with the eu , which a hamas-led government would have to stick to , deal with human rights , democracy and especially the peace process and the so-called road map that the former government had committed itself to .
it would also include direct negotiations with the israeli government . eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday -lrb- jan .

" we 're already involved in various parts of the world ; the german army is already overburdened . " however , schmidt has suggested that germany could possibly send more soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the balkans if france wanted to be part of peacekeeping in congo . deteriorating security the present debate was triggered by a united nations request for eu troops to reinforce the 15,700-strong un force in congo , the world body 's largest and costliest mission , which is trying to beef up security in the lead-up to general elections due by the end of june . the security situation has worsened after un troops stepped up operations against congolese , ugandan and rwandan rebel groups in congo 's east .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .

that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .

" " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life .

" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world honors the victims and survivors of the holocaust on january 27 jan .
27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .

" i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew .

in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .

" " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .

it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .

that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration . " sixty years after the war there is n't enough being done to teach young people the extent of the immeasurable suffering that was caused in the name of this symbol , " she said . barbara collins -lrb- jb / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yad vashem to honor german wwii officer german wehrmacht officer karl plagge has been called " better than oskar schindler " for saving jewish lives during world war ii .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .
there will always be geniuses , but a genius on the scale of mozart only comes around once every few hundred years . volker hollmichel interviewed günther bauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart and modern art mark the new year the world cup aside , germany will host an array of events in 2006 to spice up its cultural life , including a number of events marking mozart 's 250th birthday .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .
there will always be geniuses , but a genius on the scale of mozart only comes around once every few hundred years . volker hollmichel interviewed günther bauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart and modern art mark the new year the world cup aside , germany will host an array of events in 2006 to spice up its cultural life , including a number of events marking mozart 's 250th birthday .

should it continue its annual generous cash injections into the palestinian territories even if a " terror group " is in power ? as the world absorbed the ramifications of hamas ' surprise victory in this week 's palestinian polls and leaders unanimously called on the radical islamic group to renounce violence , the european union was left increasingly questioning its own role as the region 's biggest financial backer . since 2003 , the eu has annually pumped about half a billion euros -lrb- $ 610 million yearly -rrb- in the palestinian territories , much of it towards fostering democracy and aiding social and environmental projects . but hamas 's defeat of the long-dominant fatah faction in wednesday 's parliamentary vote and its reaffirmation of its commitment to what it calls armed resistance to israeli occupation has cast doubt on future cash flows . though the eu has blacklisted hamas after it spearheaded a string of deadly attacks against israel since it was formed in the late 1980s , eu officials do maintain contacts with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group plays an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been a regular visitor to the middle east last month however eu foreign policy chief javier solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government . on thursday , the 35-member eu said in a statement that " it reiterates its position that there is no place in a political process for groups or individuals who advocate violence . " at the same time it said the eu was " ready to continue to support palestinian economic development and democratic state building . " germans question future financial aid but , in a stance echoed throughout europe , many are questioning the logic of continued channeling of funds to a region governed in future by a party that refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist . in germany , politicians from both parties in the governing grand coalition , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , expressed misgivings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians want hamas to renounce violence and recognize israel either hamas renounces violence and recognizes israel 's right to exist " or we 'll think about letting the finances dry up , " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the spd told daily berliner zeitung . " we ca n't give taxpayers ' money to such a government , " said elmar brok , a cdu member and head of the foreign council in the eu parliament . other politicians have underlined that hamas must fulfill the twin requirements of renouncing violence and recognizing israel 's existence before there can be further cooperation with the eu . in addition , hamas must formulate a concrete plan for disarming its various factions , others said , saying that future german future financial help to the region would hinge on the factor . hamas dependant on eu aid in a hint that the eu might consider continuing aid provided hamas stuck to a few basic guidelines , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said this week that " the most important thing is that we plan to work with any government if that government is prepared to work for peace , by peaceful means . " " and if the government follows the two treaties that we have and the principles it contains , " she added . the two treaties with the eu , which a hamas-led government would have to stick to , deal with human rights , democracy and especially the peace process and the so-called road map that the former government had committed itself to .
it would also include direct negotiations with the israeli government . eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday -lrb- jan .
30 -rrb- to discuss the issue . an eu diplomat told deutsche welle that at the moment brussels was counting on using its financial clout to get hamas to see reason because after all even hamas leaders are aware that without eu funds , practically nothing can be achieved . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

26 , 2006 -rrb- eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .

that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew .

in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .

" " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life .

it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration .

when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration . " sixty years after the war there is n't enough being done to teach young people the extent of the immeasurable suffering that was caused in the name of this symbol , " she said . barbara collins -lrb- jb / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yad vashem to honor german wwii officer german wehrmacht officer karl plagge has been called " better than oskar schindler " for saving jewish lives during world war ii .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

" opponents could be child soldiers " german ministers have not explicitly ruled out sending peacekeepers to congo , which has seen an upsurge in rebel and militia violence in the volatile east this month .
but many have expressed reservations . deputy defense minister christian schmidt told daily berliner zeitung this week that in light of its historic experience , germany placed high demands on its troop deployments and that these could probably not be met in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of child soldiers are believed to be recruited in rebel congo militia groups " you do n't know who the opponent is or whether there is one , " schmidt said .
" it could also be that the opponents are child soldiers , " he added . federal commissioner for military affairs , reinhold robbe said germany could only send a few specialists to congo . " we 're already involved in various parts of the world ; the german army is already overburdened . " however , schmidt has suggested that germany could possibly send more soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the balkans if france wanted to be part of peacekeeping in congo . deteriorating security the present debate was triggered by a united nations request for eu troops to reinforce the 15,700-strong un force in congo , the world body 's largest and costliest mission , which is trying to beef up security in the lead-up to general elections due by the end of june . the security situation has worsened after un troops stepped up operations against congolese , ugandan and rwandan rebel groups in congo 's east .
the offensive has now taken the lives of at least 20 peacekeepers . the 1998 - 2003 civil war in this vast central african nation the size of europe claimed the lives of at least four million people . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president seeks " real partnership " with africa german president horst köhler called sunday for a " true partnership " between the west and africa as he kicked off an initiative to solve the continent 's urgent problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 press review : europe concerned over hamas win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european papers debated which was is palestine headed as politicians call on hamas to recognize israel and denounce terrorism , the international press is concerned about the prospects for peace in the middle east and who is to blame for hamas ' success . vienna 's standard found plenty of people to blame for hamas ' electoral victory , " the palestinian authority under the corrupt leadership of yassir arafat first of all ; the eu commission , which pumped money into gaza and ramallah without ensuring the principles of good governance ; and finally israel 's government , which supported the islamists during the first intifada at the end of the 80s to weaken arafat 's plo . " the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : mozart year 2006 - the 250th birthday of a musical genius celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart mozart and modern art mark the new year american director creates new space for mozart mozart : a pop icon with staying power culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.01.2006 uncommon genius for the common man großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's genius is felt equally by the aficionado and the common man wolfgang amadeus mozart will be feted worldwide this year .
in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .
there will always be geniuses , but a genius on the scale of mozart only comes around once every few hundred years . volker hollmichel interviewed günther bauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart and modern art mark the new year the world cup aside , germany will host an array of events in 2006 to spice up its cultural life , including a number of events marking mozart 's 250th birthday .

" opponents could be child soldiers " german ministers have not explicitly ruled out sending peacekeepers to congo , which has seen an upsurge in rebel and militia violence in the volatile east this month .
but many have expressed reservations . deputy defense minister christian schmidt told daily berliner zeitung this week that in light of its historic experience , germany placed high demands on its troop deployments and that these could probably not be met in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of child soldiers are believed to be recruited in rebel congo militia groups " you do n't know who the opponent is or whether there is one , " schmidt said .
" it could also be that the opponents are child soldiers , " he added . federal commissioner for military affairs , reinhold robbe said germany could only send a few specialists to congo . " we 're already involved in various parts of the world ; the german army is already overburdened . " however , schmidt has suggested that germany could possibly send more soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the balkans if france wanted to be part of peacekeeping in congo . deteriorating security the present debate was triggered by a united nations request for eu troops to reinforce the 15,700-strong un force in congo , the world body 's largest and costliest mission , which is trying to beef up security in the lead-up to general elections due by the end of june . the security situation has worsened after un troops stepped up operations against congolese , ugandan and rwandan rebel groups in congo 's east .
the offensive has now taken the lives of at least 20 peacekeepers . the 1998 - 2003 civil war in this vast central african nation the size of europe claimed the lives of at least four million people . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president seeks " real partnership " with africa german president horst köhler called sunday for a " true partnership " between the west and africa as he kicked off an initiative to solve the continent 's urgent problems .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

" opponents could be child soldiers " german ministers have not explicitly ruled out sending peacekeepers to congo , which has seen an upsurge in rebel and militia violence in the volatile east this month .

" we 're already involved in various parts of the world ; the german army is already overburdened . " however , schmidt has suggested that germany could possibly send more soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the balkans if france wanted to be part of peacekeeping in congo . deteriorating security the present debate was triggered by a united nations request for eu troops to reinforce the 15,700-strong un force in congo , the world body 's largest and costliest mission , which is trying to beef up security in the lead-up to general elections due by the end of june . the security situation has worsened after un troops stepped up operations against congolese , ugandan and rwandan rebel groups in congo 's east .

" an endless kiss " norbert radermacher , president of the jury that named ingar dragset and michael elmgreen winners of the bidding competition , said the monument would remember the victims in a " direct but subtle way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust monument in central berlin is a popular site the concrete sculpture takes its cue from the holocaust monument designed by star architect peter eisenman .
it expands on the gray cement slab theme , by turning it into a kind of house . radermacher , added that the structure , which appears cool and distant at first glance actually conceals an intimate aspect - it will have an oblique window featuring a black and white video of " an endless kiss between two men . " persecution and killing during nazi regime the decision to go ahead with the project was taken three years after the german parliament agreed to set up a memorial for murdered gays that would also serve as a visible stand against intolerance and isolation . germany 's lower house of parliament in 2000 formally apologized to gays persecuted under the nazi regime , which held power from 1933 to 1945 . between 5,000 and 10,000 homosexuals were deported to concentration camps .
during its crackdown on homosexuals the nazi regime began 100,000 legal proceedings , followed by 45,000 sentences under a criminal law that endured until 1969 . after the war , 44,231 sentences were handed down against gays in then west germany . legal discrimination of homosexual men ended in 1994 , four years after german unification .
east germany had abolished its anti-gay legislation in 1968 . although there is no timeframe for the erection of the monument for murdered homosexuals , gay rights groups have urged the government to act speedily , emphasizing that the purging of gays between 1933 and 1945 was without precedent in history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 press review : europe concerned over hamas win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european papers debated which was is palestine headed as politicians call on hamas to recognize israel and denounce terrorism , the international press is concerned about the prospects for peace in the middle east and who is to blame for hamas ' success . vienna 's standard found plenty of people to blame for hamas ' electoral victory , " the palestinian authority under the corrupt leadership of yassir arafat first of all ; the eu commission , which pumped money into gaza and ramallah without ensuring the principles of good governance ; and finally israel 's government , which supported the islamists during the first intifada at the end of the 80s to weaken arafat 's plo . " the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 press review : europe concerned over hamas win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european papers debated which was is palestine headed as politicians call on hamas to recognize israel and denounce terrorism , the international press is concerned about the prospects for peace in the middle east and who is to blame for hamas ' success . vienna 's standard found plenty of people to blame for hamas ' electoral victory , " the palestinian authority under the corrupt leadership of yassir arafat first of all ; the eu commission , which pumped money into gaza and ramallah without ensuring the principles of good governance ; and finally israel 's government , which supported the islamists during the first intifada at the end of the 80s to weaken arafat 's plo . " the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

should it continue its annual generous cash injections into the palestinian territories even if a " terror group " is in power ? as the world absorbed the ramifications of hamas ' surprise victory in this week 's palestinian polls and leaders unanimously called on the radical islamic group to renounce violence , the european union was left increasingly questioning its own role as the region 's biggest financial backer . since 2003 , the eu has annually pumped about half a billion euros -lrb- $ 610 million yearly -rrb- in the palestinian territories , much of it towards fostering democracy and aiding social and environmental projects . but hamas 's defeat of the long-dominant fatah faction in wednesday 's parliamentary vote and its reaffirmation of its commitment to what it calls armed resistance to israeli occupation has cast doubt on future cash flows . though the eu has blacklisted hamas after it spearheaded a string of deadly attacks against israel since it was formed in the late 1980s , eu officials do maintain contacts with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group plays an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been a regular visitor to the middle east last month however eu foreign policy chief javier solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government . on thursday , the 35-member eu said in a statement that " it reiterates its position that there is no place in a political process for groups or individuals who advocate violence . " at the same time it said the eu was " ready to continue to support palestinian economic development and democratic state building . " germans question future financial aid but , in a stance echoed throughout europe , many are questioning the logic of continued channeling of funds to a region governed in future by a party that refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist . in germany , politicians from both parties in the governing grand coalition , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , expressed misgivings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians want hamas to renounce violence and recognize israel either hamas renounces violence and recognizes israel 's right to exist " or we 'll think about letting the finances dry up , " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the spd told daily berliner zeitung . " we ca n't give taxpayers ' money to such a government , " said elmar brok , a cdu member and head of the foreign council in the eu parliament . other politicians have underlined that hamas must fulfill the twin requirements of renouncing violence and recognizing israel 's existence before there can be further cooperation with the eu . in addition , hamas must formulate a concrete plan for disarming its various factions , others said , saying that future german future financial help to the region would hinge on the factor . hamas dependant on eu aid in a hint that the eu might consider continuing aid provided hamas stuck to a few basic guidelines , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said this week that " the most important thing is that we plan to work with any government if that government is prepared to work for peace , by peaceful means . " " and if the government follows the two treaties that we have and the principles it contains , " she added . the two treaties with the eu , which a hamas-led government would have to stick to , deal with human rights , democracy and especially the peace process and the so-called road map that the former government had committed itself to .
it would also include direct negotiations with the israeli government . eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday -lrb- jan .
30 -rrb- to discuss the issue . an eu diplomat told deutsche welle that at the moment brussels was counting on using its financial clout to get hamas to see reason because after all even hamas leaders are aware that without eu funds , practically nothing can be achieved . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

should it continue its annual generous cash injections into the palestinian territories even if a " terror group " is in power ? as the world absorbed the ramifications of hamas ' surprise victory in this week 's palestinian polls and leaders unanimously called on the radical islamic group to renounce violence , the european union was left increasingly questioning its own role as the region 's biggest financial backer . since 2003 , the eu has annually pumped about half a billion euros -lrb- $ 610 million yearly -rrb- in the palestinian territories , much of it towards fostering democracy and aiding social and environmental projects . but hamas 's defeat of the long-dominant fatah faction in wednesday 's parliamentary vote and its reaffirmation of its commitment to what it calls armed resistance to israeli occupation has cast doubt on future cash flows . though the eu has blacklisted hamas after it spearheaded a string of deadly attacks against israel since it was formed in the late 1980s , eu officials do maintain contacts with hamas ' civilian branch , saying that the group plays an important role in setting up social structures in the palestinian territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been a regular visitor to the middle east last month however eu foreign policy chief javier solana threatened to cut off funds should hamas join the government . on thursday , the 35-member eu said in a statement that " it reiterates its position that there is no place in a political process for groups or individuals who advocate violence . " at the same time it said the eu was " ready to continue to support palestinian economic development and democratic state building . " germans question future financial aid but , in a stance echoed throughout europe , many are questioning the logic of continued channeling of funds to a region governed in future by a party that refuses to recognize israel 's right to exist . in germany , politicians from both parties in the governing grand coalition , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , expressed misgivings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european politicians want hamas to renounce violence and recognize israel either hamas renounces violence and recognizes israel 's right to exist " or we 'll think about letting the finances dry up , " gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the spd told daily berliner zeitung . " we ca n't give taxpayers ' money to such a government , " said elmar brok , a cdu member and head of the foreign council in the eu parliament . other politicians have underlined that hamas must fulfill the twin requirements of renouncing violence and recognizing israel 's existence before there can be further cooperation with the eu . in addition , hamas must formulate a concrete plan for disarming its various factions , others said , saying that future german future financial help to the region would hinge on the factor . hamas dependant on eu aid in a hint that the eu might consider continuing aid provided hamas stuck to a few basic guidelines , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said this week that " the most important thing is that we plan to work with any government if that government is prepared to work for peace , by peaceful means . " " and if the government follows the two treaties that we have and the principles it contains , " she added . the two treaties with the eu , which a hamas-led government would have to stick to , deal with human rights , democracy and especially the peace process and the so-called road map that the former government had committed itself to .
it would also include direct negotiations with the israeli government . eu foreign ministers will meet in brussels on monday -lrb- jan .
30 -rrb- to discuss the issue . an eu diplomat told deutsche welle that at the moment brussels was counting on using its financial clout to get hamas to see reason because after all even hamas leaders are aware that without eu funds , practically nothing can be achieved . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration . " sixty years after the war there is n't enough being done to teach young people the extent of the immeasurable suffering that was caused in the name of this symbol , " she said . barbara collins -lrb- jb / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yad vashem to honor german wwii officer german wehrmacht officer karl plagge has been called " better than oskar schindler " for saving jewish lives during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world honors the victims and survivors of the holocaust on january 27 jan .
27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .

27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

" the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper drew a similar conclusion in its editorial .
" much of the blame lies with the usa and the eu for tolerating the ubiquitous corruption that their financing enabled , " the paper opined .
" israel and the western countries did not do enough to pull the palestinians from their misery .
now it will be even more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papers agreed hamas ' victory could make peace more difficult hamas ' legislative victory opened " an earthquake that promises turbulent times in the middle east , " according to the spanish daily el pais .
" the israeli stage has already lost a central player with sharon 's stroke , " the paper wrote .
" with hamas ' invasion to the center of palestinian power another key player has entered who is only going to make the situation more difficult . " what the future would bring palestinians was the focus of brussels ' de morgen .
" the masks will fall when the new government is put together , and not just in regard to israel , " the paper remarked .
" hamas wants to create a muslim state for the palestinians where religion is the highest law of the land . " germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that it 's the west 's response to the new government that will play the largest role in the middle east 's future .
" the way the west , europeans and americans , respond to this development will be an important factor in determining how seriously muslims take the demands for democratization , " the paper noted .
" moreover , a palestinian government in which hamas is a coalition partner can not ignore the fact that the west plays a pivotal role in financing the upkeep of the palestinian territories . " " a pointed dilemma " is beginning for europeans , according to milan 's corriere della sera .
" from now on , ignoring the power of hamas is impossible , " the daily reflected .
" but to try to bend today 's hamas with the european union 's traditional carrot-without-a-stick diplomacy of negotiations and money could lead to catastrophe . "
the italian paper recommended the eu be " determined to confront hamas with resolve and ready to react against hate , violence and terror at every opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many papers pointed out that the eu is a major financer of the palestinian authority moscow 's kommersant did n't give up hope for peace .
" the world is witness to an experiment that is trying to find an alternative to the violent destruction of radical movements that are kept out of their countries ' political processes , " it observed , and the experiment is n't over .
" when hamas comes to power and stays in power , the experiment 's failure has to be admitted , " the paper wrote .
" but what will happen if hamas unexpectedly changes , and the example becomes contagious .
what will politicians who have based their leadership on the fight against terrorism do then ? " portugal 's correio da manha stated that peace talks needed to continue with hamas , a step many western leaders are avoiding .
" the hamas victory was won at the ballot box , democratically , " the paper pointed out .
" certain european leaders are already quick with criticism and threats .
this is a mistake and a dangerous one , because if these elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles , then it is vital for us to respond with a peace-seeking diplomacy adapted to the new situation .
even is this means we have to negotiate with radicals and terrorists .
negotiating does not mean surrendering . " the gravity of the situation was not enough to keep de volkskrant from mentioning that a little bit of schadenfreude could hardly be repressed .
" fatah 's spectacular loss is one of the most well-deserved punishments for the apparatchik and people pulling the strings who made the palestinian authority into a pool of incompetence and corruption , " the dutch paper wrote .
" the outside world has to take credit for that since , for the dear cause of peace , it looked away from palestinian mismanagement .
this is what you get . " dw staff -lrb- gh / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas win casts doubt on eu 's role as financial backer the shock win by hamas in palestinian polls has placed the eu in a quandary .

do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .

mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world honors the victims and survivors of the holocaust on january 27 jan .
27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .
it 's another step on our quest for humanity . cornelia rabitz -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wannsee museum presents the documents of horror the wannsee museum has revamped its exhibit on the notorious 1942 conference which sealed the fate of europe 's jews .

instead , he spent until the end of the war saving lives - including stella müller-madej 's . stella müller-madej survived the krakow ghetto and the plaszow and auschwitz concentration camps .
she was a witness to unspeakable cruelty .
but she was one of the lucky ones : she was one of the 1,100 " schindler jews " oskar schindler saved . her path to schindler 's factory , where she spent the last nine months before the end of the war in relative safety , was long and winding .
that road traveled through the krakow ghetto and two concentration camps , plaszow and auschwitz , where she miraculously escaped death many times . she was 9-years-old and carefree when the war broke out .
when it ended , she was 15 and could n't remember what freedom was like . " it was very difficult for me to get used to civilization again , " she said . writing helped after the war , she decided to use writing as a tool to help her adjust to her new life , and tell about her past ordeal .
it was a decision she made after seeing a movie about the war with her father .
the depiction of the conditions shocked her . " after what i went through , the bugs everywhere , the dirt , the muck , hunger and murder all around - yet this film was somehow so sanitized , " she said .
" there was , in the film , the prisoners in the striped prison garb and the terrible roar of the camp guards .
for me , who was convinced every day that i would be destroyed , the film was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he saved 1,100 jews she could n't understand the reaction of the public .
one person would be sobbing , while at the same time , another would make comments such as : " that 's nonsense .
that could never have happened . " she decided that from then on , it was her duty as a survivor to commemorate all of those that were mistreated , shot , hanged and gassed before her eyes . " i wo n't let myself forget that these people who perished without any reason deserved to be remembered , " she said . a new biography now she has written a biography - the only one by a " schindler jew . "
in it , she relates how she , her parents and her brother came to be on " schindler 's list " by accident . " we heard about some german who had people in a camp at his factory who were better off , not mistreated , and did n't have to go hungry , " she said .
" that was almost impossible to believe in our camp in plaszow , that someone like that could have existed . " her uncle used a connection to get her family on the list .
soon after , they were able to move to schindler 's factory in bohemia where they , and hundreds of others , lived out the war in relative safety and comfort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view in the office of oscar schindler 's office in the original building of the " emalia " factory in krakow at the end of the war , those who survived under schindler 's protection gave him a gold ring on which were engraved a sentence from the talmud : " whoever saves one life saves the entire world . " " we were surprised by every hour that we survived , because we all knew that we had been condemned to death , whether from gassing or being shot , " she said .
" we had no claim on life . " gratitude in light of the near limitless gratitude felt by those jews who schindler saved , it is understandable why none of them accepted the later controversies that emerged about schilder 's motives and even behavior . " for my biological life , i thank my parents , " she said .
" but for my life i thank oskar schindler .
even the most devout jews thank schindler instead of god to this day . " müller-madej says she does not feel that today 's young germans are guilty because of the actions of their fathers and grandfathers , although coming to terms with the country took a long time .
it does worry her that some young people , including many outside of germany , see hitler 's regime and its symbol , the swastika , as worthy of admiration . " sixty years after the war there is n't enough being done to teach young people the extent of the immeasurable suffering that was caused in the name of this symbol , " she said . barbara collins -lrb- jb / jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yad vashem to honor german wwii officer german wehrmacht officer karl plagge has been called " better than oskar schindler " for saving jewish lives during world war ii .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .
there will always be geniuses , but a genius on the scale of mozart only comes around once every few hundred years . volker hollmichel interviewed günther bauer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart and modern art mark the new year the world cup aside , germany will host an array of events in 2006 to spice up its cultural life , including a number of events marking mozart 's 250th birthday .

in an interview with dw-world , mozart expert günther bauer explains the undying fascination with the musical genius on what would have been his 250th birthday . professor günther bauer served for many years as rector of salzburg university 's mozarteum , one of the leading mozart research institutes worldwide . dw-world : professor bauer , assuming that mozart wrote his music for his contemporaries , it seems only logical to ask about the reason for the continuing relevance of his work .
do we even know why we still love to listen to and perform mozart ? günther bauer : that is the million-dollar question - quite simply , because his music is so incredibly good . to what extent does our picture of mozart differ from earlier perceptions , and how is our picture of him influenced ? our picture of mozart today is influenced mainly through the total availability in the media , meaning that , today , we 're in a position to access the complete works of mozart , for example , in the form of cds .
that has the result that mozart 's work has spread , in massive quantities , around the entire globe . why is it though , that mozart of all people , is the subject of such awe and admiration ? that again has to do with the uniqueness and quality of his music , it 's as simple as that . but ca n't this quality be pinpointed ?
can we unearth the secret of mozart and his genius ? he wanted to communicate both to us , the very simple , folk melodies that the average man on the street can quite easily whistle , and behind this , an incredibly difficult , complicated network of music that was both difficult to write and to perform .
mozart appeals equally to the most demanding music lovers and the cobbler on the street who can whistle along to " figaro . " you often hear that mozart 's genius was simply a gift from god .
but is it possible to discern a certain line of development in his body of work ? a line of development is n't really present in mozart .
the very first work listed in the köchel catalogue of his compositions is a mozart , perfect to the core .
so in that sense , he did n't develop himself as a composer , he was a genius . in your view , is there any prospect today of finding " the next mozart ? " i ca n't really answer that , but my personal opinion is , no . why does it seem though , that despite some really maniacal parents , it 's not possible to produce another talent like mozart ? the maniacal parents do n't really help us at all ; the cultural background does n't exist today in the same way it did in mozart 's time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.01.2006 holocaust remembrance day more relevant than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world honors the victims and survivors of the holocaust on january 27 jan .
27 , 1945 : the red army liberated auschwitz , exposing nazi brutality to the world .
sixty years later , the event is honored as the first international holocaust day .
it comes at a time of heightened anti-semitism . nazi rule in germany lasted from 1933 to 1945 and cost the lives of six million european jews , who were gassed , starved or worked to death in concentration camps across the war-torn continent . on january 27 , 1945 , the concentration camp at auschwitz in poland was liberated by the advancing red army of the soviet union .
what they discovered there would become the legacy of the nazi regime 's brutality and inhumanity . for ten years now , that date has been reserved in germany for a day of remembrance , a day when the country remembers the day the holocaust became a lasting scar on world history .
this year , january 27 will become an international day of remembrance as the united nations recognizes holocaust day as a global anniversary . its recognition by the world body comes at a time when the holocaust is once more being used as a political tool and as a platform for the renaissance of anti-semitism beyond the borders of europe where the original atrocities took place .
the latest denials of the holocaust , most prominently put forward by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , threaten to undermine efforts to respectfully honor the anniversary . it is now 61 years since the red army freed the concentration camp at auschwitz .
the number of surviving victims , like the eyewitnesses to the atrocities and the liberation of the camp , decreases every year . lessons still need to be learned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : efforts to keep the memory alive must continue as survivors become fewer as time passes , it becomes increasingly obvious that the reality of the horrors of auschwitz fades , and that the distance of years somehow estranges humanity from one of its greatest shames . but auschwitz is not the only abomination that suffers dilution through the passage of time : the fate of political prisoners at the hands of the nazis , the sinti , the roma , the so-called " anti-socials , " the homosexuals and the religious minorities . efforts to remember the legacy of the third reich have taken on many different aspects in many countries across europe .
memories of nazi rule mix with other political-historical experiences to stamp the horrors of the 20th century on countries in many ways . the people in the east of europe , who had to suffer the soviet occupation after the nazi reign of terror , have had it especially hard .
poland , the baltic states , the former soviet states on the boundaries of europe ; all have had two masters in the past , both brutal and unforgiving .
after national socialism came soviet communism . while no one should doubt the suffering of the jews during world war ii , remembrance must also be afforded those who suffered under stalin ’ s boot for many more years after the nazis were defeated . a day for all who have suffered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education for younger generations is extremely important january 27 , therefore , becomes an international day of remembrance on which every country can reflect on brutality and repression .
the day is dedicated to all those who suffered but it is mostly about the destruction of european judaism .
this date in 2006 will be the day when the world thinks of the victims of the holocaust and it should be a day when people look back to the past to learn the awful lessons which must be avoided in the future . the remembrance of the genocide remains an ethical obligation , and this obligation remains as strong now as ever before as suffering and mass murder continues to happen in the world . the timing of this international recognition must not be played down lightly .
no longer is anti-semitism a smoldering bitterness in the backrooms of far-right strongholds in germany . iranian comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahamdinejad 's comments have stirred latent anti-semitic feelings in the middle east when the message of hate is being preached so publicly by the president of iran and the government in tehran is planning a conference to discuss the holocaust " myth " with notorious deniers is attendance , we can see that anti-semitism is far from being a thing of the past .
it did not die on january 27 , 1945 . the iranian president 's message is finding receptive ears .
whether it is the muslim brotherhood in egypt - the strongest opposition party in the egyptian parliament with scions in other islamic lands - or representative of the militant hamas in palestinian territories , the hatred of the state israel unites them . israel is the land given to the survivors of the holocaust and the constant thorn in the flesh of extremist muslims .
with the palestinians suffering under the oppression of israel , there is plenty of fuel for a new wave of anti-jewish propaganda . one could dismiss this as an ideological obsession if it was not for the growing voice of the holocaust deniers .
for the survivors of the holocaust and their families , this is a further infliction of pain and humiliation . europe , specifically germany , should lead the opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should lead the way in opposing anti-semitism what can be done ?
the only correct action is not to remain silenced and not to polish over history .
ahmadinejad and like-minded people must be faced with a strong and clear " no " from europe .
the idea to counter the proposed holocaust conference in tehran with a european summit featuring arab and israeli intellectuals is a good one . germany , which carries the heaviest burden of historical responsibility , should be there leading the way .
germany should also continue to work as the model for processing and archiving the crimes of national socialist history . the holocaust anniversary on january 27 reminds us all that we should not stop in our efforts to remember the events that are being commemorated out of respect to the victims .

the decision means that the salaries of all bolivian public sector employees will be reviewed , as no official can earn more than the president .
mr morales said the money saved would be used to increase the numbers of doctors and teachers .
mr morales suggested that members of congress should cut their salaries too .
during the campaign , mr morales had pledged to halve his own pay if elected .
the move announced after his first cabinet went beyond that , with a cut of 57 % .
bbc south america correspondent daniel schweimler says many voted for mr morales believing that he was different from the more conservative politicians who have governed in the past .
the former llama herder and coca leaf farmer was inaugurated last sunday as bolivia 's first indigenous president .
he has promised to fight corruption , introduce a new tax on the wealthy , and renationalise energy companies .

every nhs trust or primary care trust in england was asked for its current financial situation , whether it was in debt or had money in the bank .
the total for the whole country showed a debt of £ 1.07bn - despite the nhs receiving record funding of £ 76.4bn for the financial year 2005-2006 .
it has led to patient services being affected as trusts try to cut spending .

health secretary patricia hewitt told bbc news : " three quarters of local nhs organisations are balancing the books or in surplus . "
but in the bbc survey more than half the trusts indicated they were in debt , although some of those did forecast they would break even by the end of the financial year .
some of those who said they would cut or eliminate their debts by the end of march said their cuts would have no impact on patients .

" this government will have trebled the investment in the nhs - and we are ensuring that every penny of extra cash is spent wisely for the benefit of patients .
" throughout the country people can see that our investment means extra doctors and nurses , quality treatment and faster access to health services . "
much of the debt is centred on london and the home counties , with deficits in the capital alone accounting for almost a quarter of the total across england .
hammersmith hospital nhs trust reported the biggest single deficit the largest single reported debt for any one health trust was for the hammersmith hospitals nhs trust in london .
it has a debt of £ 16.2m , but also runs ravenscroft hospital for the department of health , which has a debt of £ 19.1m - making a total deficit for the trust of £ 35.3m.
management said they had taken a wide range of steps to reduce the debt - including cutting 300 jobs .
the john radcliffe hospital in oxford announced in december that many patients would not be able to have the same heart therapy received by prime minister tony blair , with only life-threatening conditions still being treated .
' detrimental effect ' the withdrawal for up to 100 patients of cardiac ablation therapy , to control an irregular heartbeat , was blamed on the need to cut oxfordshire 's £ 15.1m deficit .
ms hewitt criticised the trust 's bosses for failing to manage their budget effectively - and the trust is not one of the 18 to be given turnaround support .
ms hewitt told the bbc : " improving financial management does not mean compromising services for patients .
it is very worrying at the moment michael summer , the patients association " any action that the nhs takes to reduce deficits should not lower the quality of care provided to patients . "
several organisations have expressed their concern at the level of debt in the nhs , or the way it was being dealt with .
michael summers , chairman of the patients association , said : " those that have very large deficits do affect patient care , it 's very clear .
" it is very worrying at the moment .
" looking at it optimistically , in the new financial year hopefully things will get better , but it is not going to happen overnight . "
the royal college of nursing said earlier this month it feared more than 3,000 health service jobs could be lost through cost-cutting efforts which were having a " direct and detrimental " effect on patients .
unison , the trade union which represents many nurses , said newly-qualified staff were struggling to find jobs because posts were being left unfilled .
and the nhs confederation , which represents more than 90 % of nhs organisations , said trusts were under too much pressure to cut deficits quickly and needed to be given " space " to deal with debt in a way which had patients ' care at heart .
