bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .
but marie-agnes von stechow hopes it wo n't be long before other schools realize that telling tales is n't always a bad thing . bianca von der au -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

the conservative politician said monday that more patience is needed in dealing with iran . polenz also said the united states should hold direct talks with tehran to ease the crisis . the us is pushing for the un to impose sanctions , but in a situation reminiscent of the conflict over the iraq war , it is having trouble winning support , even from its normally strong ally , germany . china and russia , which both hold veto power in the un security council , also oppose punitive sanctions on iran . " it is at least doubtful that these sanctions would be sufficient to change iranian policy , " polenz said .
" i would prefer a way to deal differently with iran .
i think we have the time to be patient . " polenz is set to visit iran next week following his meetings with senior us officials in washington this week .
he added that in order for sanctions to work , there would also have to be broad consensus from arab states , and recommended that discussions about iran be widened to include arab nations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats seek common policy on iran world powers head into a second day of talks in moscow on wednesday , seeking a common strategy on iran 's nuclear ambitions .

proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

a senior german politician meanwhile said patience is needed . iran 's top national security official on tuesday refused to rule out using oil as a weapon in the dispute over the islamic republic 's nuclear drive , saying any " radical measures " against the country would have " important consequences " for energy supplies .
also on tuesday , iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani said iran will suspend its relations with the united nation 's atomic watchdog if sanctions are imposed . " if you decide to use sanctions against us , our relations with the agency will be suspended , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . the warning , made at a conference on nuclear energy in tehran , came ahead of friday 's deadline set by the un security council for iran to freeze ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment work . iran has refused to do so , leaving it exposed to un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has successfully enriched uranium iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel for power plants , but the process can be extended to make weapons . the iaea is the agency investigating iran 's program , and any halt in relations with iran would spell an end to international inspections and monitoring of iran 's nuclear facilities . germany : sanctions unlikely to work according to ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , sanctions are unlikely to work with iran .
the conservative politician said monday that more patience is needed in dealing with iran . polenz also said the united states should hold direct talks with tehran to ease the crisis . the us is pushing for the un to impose sanctions , but in a situation reminiscent of the conflict over the iraq war , it is having trouble winning support , even from its normally strong ally , germany . china and russia , which both hold veto power in the un security council , also oppose punitive sanctions on iran . " it is at least doubtful that these sanctions would be sufficient to change iranian policy , " polenz said .
" i would prefer a way to deal differently with iran .
i think we have the time to be patient . " polenz is set to visit iran next week following his meetings with senior us officials in washington this week .
he added that in order for sanctions to work , there would also have to be broad consensus from arab states , and recommended that discussions about iran be widened to include arab nations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats seek common policy on iran world powers head into a second day of talks in moscow on wednesday , seeking a common strategy on iran 's nuclear ambitions .

they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen is set to present the government 's 7th family report in berlin tuesday , after the cabinet spent the morning discussing how to make starting a family a more attractive option . women to blame according to the daily rheinische post newspaper , the report reveals that the roots of the problem lie with the nation 's women .
not only are they reluctant to have children , they could also be working a whole lot harder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mothers : could do better " working mothers account for the narrowest segment of the labor market , " said the 600-page document .

proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

" the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany debates the family fewer european couples tying the knot new parenting legislation focuses on fathers opinion : mother 's day is n't what it used to be germany 's population problems no longer taboo germany -pipe- 25.04.2006 german women take the rap for declining birth rate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german women are n't yearning for kids the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen is set to present the government 's 7th family report in berlin tuesday , after the cabinet spent the morning discussing how to make starting a family a more attractive option . women to blame according to the daily rheinische post newspaper , the report reveals that the roots of the problem lie with the nation 's women .
not only are they reluctant to have children , they could also be working a whole lot harder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mothers : could do better " working mothers account for the narrowest segment of the labor market , " said the 600-page document .
spending some two and a half hours a day with their children , they might be comfortably within the european average , but the study suggests german mothers have more free time than their european counterparts and are n't really pulling their weight . " rather than devoting themselves to domestic life , they are investing their time in leisure activities , " it said . it 's not the money experts have long been insisting that germany 's family policy needs a complete overhaul , and is failing both to boost the flagging birth rate - now down to 1.3 children per woman - and to effectively tackle child poverty .
in fact , the number of children living on the breadline is growing steadily . family policy currently costs berlin some 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 185 billion -rrb- per year , but the report 's authors say the government 's emphasis on financial incentives has proved misguided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even financial incentives are n't enough to make families look good " financial measures have not managed to encourage young adults to factor children into a broader life plan they way they do in france , denmark , sweden , the netherlands and briatian , " said the report . the standard excuse for germany 's population problem is the difficulty of striking the work-life balance .
now , the family report has unearthed a different reason - women just do n't feel their biological clocks ticking .
in other european countries , " the statistical ideal family for 20-34-year-old women in other european countries comprises 2.5 children , while women in eastern germany want just 1.6 children , and women in western germany 1.7 . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : how to boost the german birth rate the birth rate in germany has plummeted to the lowest level since 1945 , creating a demographic crunch that will create massive problems for the social welfare state .
so what else is new , wonders dw 's rolf wenkel .
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .
a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .
-lrb- april 22 , 2006 -rrb- work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .

but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .

politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .

rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .
but marie-agnes von stechow hopes it wo n't be long before other schools realize that telling tales is n't always a bad thing . bianca von der au -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

spain has tried to block the takeover and faces possible disciplinary action . " after examining the operation , the european commission concluded that the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition " in the european market , the eu 's head office said in a statement . but it added : " the commission will continue to keep the development in the german and spanish gas and electricity markets and the other markets concerned under review . " despite the green light , there are still hurdles to overcome before the 29.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , which e.on announced in february , can be completed .
the spanish government is trying to block the bid in favor of a lower offer from spanish natural gas provider gas natural sdg sa . that set off protests and critics condemned what some see as a trend toward national economic protectionism in several eu countries . while the eu did not immediately address that issue on tuesday , it said it looked at the general situation on the european market and found there was adequate room for multinational integration .

a senior german politician meanwhile said patience is needed . iran 's top national security official on tuesday refused to rule out using oil as a weapon in the dispute over the islamic republic 's nuclear drive , saying any " radical measures " against the country would have " important consequences " for energy supplies .
also on tuesday , iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani said iran will suspend its relations with the united nation 's atomic watchdog if sanctions are imposed . " if you decide to use sanctions against us , our relations with the agency will be suspended , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . the warning , made at a conference on nuclear energy in tehran , came ahead of friday 's deadline set by the un security council for iran to freeze ultra-sensitive uranium enrichment work . iran has refused to do so , leaving it exposed to un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has successfully enriched uranium iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel for power plants , but the process can be extended to make weapons . the iaea is the agency investigating iran 's program , and any halt in relations with iran would spell an end to international inspections and monitoring of iran 's nuclear facilities . germany : sanctions unlikely to work according to ruprecht polenz , chairman of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , sanctions are unlikely to work with iran .
the conservative politician said monday that more patience is needed in dealing with iran . polenz also said the united states should hold direct talks with tehran to ease the crisis . the us is pushing for the un to impose sanctions , but in a situation reminiscent of the conflict over the iraq war , it is having trouble winning support , even from its normally strong ally , germany . china and russia , which both hold veto power in the un security council , also oppose punitive sanctions on iran . " it is at least doubtful that these sanctions would be sufficient to change iranian policy , " polenz said .
" i would prefer a way to deal differently with iran .
i think we have the time to be patient . " polenz is set to visit iran next week following his meetings with senior us officials in washington this week .
he added that in order for sanctions to work , there would also have to be broad consensus from arab states , and recommended that discussions about iran be widened to include arab nations . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats seek common policy on iran world powers head into a second day of talks in moscow on wednesday , seeking a common strategy on iran 's nuclear ambitions .

proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion .

" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal .

" we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

" images with thousands of protestors might make an impression on the hostage-takers . " it was the 25th vigil in leipzig for nitzschke and braeunlich since their abduction on january 24 .
the men were kidnapped while installing industrial equipment for their company cryotec in the iraqi city of beidschi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young leipzig shows its support although the turnout at the vigil was low , there have been other signs of solidarity for the two men in leipzig .

spending some two and a half hours a day with their children , they might be comfortably within the european average , but the study suggests german mothers have more free time than their european counterparts and are n't really pulling their weight . " rather than devoting themselves to domestic life , they are investing their time in leisure activities , " it said . it 's not the money experts have long been insisting that germany 's family policy needs a complete overhaul , and is failing both to boost the flagging birth rate - now down to 1.3 children per woman - and to effectively tackle child poverty .
in fact , the number of children living on the breadline is growing steadily . family policy currently costs berlin some 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 185 billion -rrb- per year , but the report 's authors say the government 's emphasis on financial incentives has proved misguided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even financial incentives are n't enough to make families look good " financial measures have not managed to encourage young adults to factor children into a broader life plan they way they do in france , denmark , sweden , the netherlands and briatian , " said the report . the standard excuse for germany 's population problem is the difficulty of striking the work-life balance .
now , the family report has unearthed a different reason - women just do n't feel their biological clocks ticking .
in other european countries , " the statistical ideal family for 20-34-year-old women in other european countries comprises 2.5 children , while women in eastern germany want just 1.6 children , and women in western germany 1.7 .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .
but marie-agnes von stechow hopes it wo n't be long before other schools realize that telling tales is n't always a bad thing . bianca von der au -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .

rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .

they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen is set to present the government 's 7th family report in berlin tuesday , after the cabinet spent the morning discussing how to make starting a family a more attractive option . women to blame according to the daily rheinische post newspaper , the report reveals that the roots of the problem lie with the nation 's women .
not only are they reluctant to have children , they could also be working a whole lot harder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mothers : could do better " working mothers account for the narrowest segment of the labor market , " said the 600-page document .
spending some two and a half hours a day with their children , they might be comfortably within the european average , but the study suggests german mothers have more free time than their european counterparts and are n't really pulling their weight . " rather than devoting themselves to domestic life , they are investing their time in leisure activities , " it said . it 's not the money experts have long been insisting that germany 's family policy needs a complete overhaul , and is failing both to boost the flagging birth rate - now down to 1.3 children per woman - and to effectively tackle child poverty .
in fact , the number of children living on the breadline is growing steadily . family policy currently costs berlin some 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 185 billion -rrb- per year , but the report 's authors say the government 's emphasis on financial incentives has proved misguided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even financial incentives are n't enough to make families look good " financial measures have not managed to encourage young adults to factor children into a broader life plan they way they do in france , denmark , sweden , the netherlands and briatian , " said the report . the standard excuse for germany 's population problem is the difficulty of striking the work-life balance .
now , the family report has unearthed a different reason - women just do n't feel their biological clocks ticking .
in other european countries , " the statistical ideal family for 20-34-year-old women in other european countries comprises 2.5 children , while women in eastern germany want just 1.6 children , and women in western germany 1.7 . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : how to boost the german birth rate the birth rate in germany has plummeted to the lowest level since 1945 , creating a demographic crunch that will create massive problems for the social welfare state .
so what else is new , wonders dw 's rolf wenkel .
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .
a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .
-lrb- april 22 , 2006 -rrb- work-life balance gets boost in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.04.2006 telling tales to combat juvenile violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can fairy tales help immigrants learn german ?
reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .
but marie-agnes von stechow hopes it wo n't be long before other schools realize that telling tales is n't always a bad thing . bianca von der au -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .

proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen is set to present the government 's 7th family report in berlin tuesday , after the cabinet spent the morning discussing how to make starting a family a more attractive option . women to blame according to the daily rheinische post newspaper , the report reveals that the roots of the problem lie with the nation 's women .
not only are they reluctant to have children , they could also be working a whole lot harder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mothers : could do better " working mothers account for the narrowest segment of the labor market , " said the 600-page document .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .
but marie-agnes von stechow hopes it wo n't be long before other schools realize that telling tales is n't always a bad thing . bianca von der au -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.04.2006 germany debates future funding of fight against extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state funds many projects to prevent the rise of the far-right federal funding for a multitude of programs to fight right-wing extremism in germany is coming up for review .
proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .

" pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .

proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

" despite the green light , there are still hurdles to overcome before the 29.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , which e.on announced in february , can be completed .
the spanish government is trying to block the bid in favor of a lower offer from spanish natural gas provider gas natural sdg sa . that set off protests and critics condemned what some see as a trend toward national economic protectionism in several eu countries . while the eu did not immediately address that issue on tuesday , it said it looked at the general situation on the european market and found there was adequate room for multinational integration .

they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen is set to present the government 's 7th family report in berlin tuesday , after the cabinet spent the morning discussing how to make starting a family a more attractive option . women to blame according to the daily rheinische post newspaper , the report reveals that the roots of the problem lie with the nation 's women .
not only are they reluctant to have children , they could also be working a whole lot harder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mothers : could do better " working mothers account for the narrowest segment of the labor market , " said the 600-page document .
spending some two and a half hours a day with their children , they might be comfortably within the european average , but the study suggests german mothers have more free time than their european counterparts and are n't really pulling their weight . " rather than devoting themselves to domestic life , they are investing their time in leisure activities , " it said . it 's not the money experts have long been insisting that germany 's family policy needs a complete overhaul , and is failing both to boost the flagging birth rate - now down to 1.3 children per woman - and to effectively tackle child poverty .
in fact , the number of children living on the breadline is growing steadily . family policy currently costs berlin some 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 185 billion -rrb- per year , but the report 's authors say the government 's emphasis on financial incentives has proved misguided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even financial incentives are n't enough to make families look good " financial measures have not managed to encourage young adults to factor children into a broader life plan they way they do in france , denmark , sweden , the netherlands and briatian , " said the report . the standard excuse for germany 's population problem is the difficulty of striking the work-life balance .
now , the family report has unearthed a different reason - women just do n't feel their biological clocks ticking .
in other european countries , " the statistical ideal family for 20-34-year-old women in other european countries comprises 2.5 children , while women in eastern germany want just 1.6 children , and women in western germany 1.7 .

" we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place .

they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves . german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen is set to present the government 's 7th family report in berlin tuesday , after the cabinet spent the morning discussing how to make starting a family a more attractive option . women to blame according to the daily rheinische post newspaper , the report reveals that the roots of the problem lie with the nation 's women .
not only are they reluctant to have children , they could also be working a whole lot harder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mothers : could do better " working mothers account for the narrowest segment of the labor market , " said the 600-page document .
spending some two and a half hours a day with their children , they might be comfortably within the european average , but the study suggests german mothers have more free time than their european counterparts and are n't really pulling their weight . " rather than devoting themselves to domestic life , they are investing their time in leisure activities , " it said . it 's not the money experts have long been insisting that germany 's family policy needs a complete overhaul , and is failing both to boost the flagging birth rate - now down to 1.3 children per woman - and to effectively tackle child poverty .
in fact , the number of children living on the breadline is growing steadily . family policy currently costs berlin some 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 185 billion -rrb- per year , but the report 's authors say the government 's emphasis on financial incentives has proved misguided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even financial incentives are n't enough to make families look good " financial measures have not managed to encourage young adults to factor children into a broader life plan they way they do in france , denmark , sweden , the netherlands and briatian , " said the report . the standard excuse for germany 's population problem is the difficulty of striking the work-life balance .
now , the family report has unearthed a different reason - women just do n't feel their biological clocks ticking .
in other european countries , " the statistical ideal family for 20-34-year-old women in other european countries comprises 2.5 children , while women in eastern germany want just 1.6 children , and women in western germany 1.7 .

proposals from the conservative cdu that could dilute this funding have some experts worried . the case of ermyas m. , the ethiopian-born german who was brutally beaten over the easter weekend in what many consider to have been a racist attack , has again put the specter of right-wing extremism in germany firmly in the spotlight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in potsdam are still shaken by the attack on ermyas m. experts say far-right , anti-foreigner sentiment is on the rise throughout the country , especially in the states that formally comprised east germany .
and they 're concerned about the current debate on the future of state funding for programs aimed at combating intolerance and racism . funding agreement to expire following an arson attack on a synagogue in düsseldorf in october 2000 , the federal government under former chancellor gerhard schröder set up several initiatives to counter right-wing extremism .
the current funding agreement for these programs expires at the end of this year , and although continued funding has been guaranteed in the new government 's coalition agreement , the ruling conservative party , the cdu , has said it wants to review how the money is divided . currently , around 19 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- a year flow into civitas , a tolerance initiative aimed particularly at eastern germany , and entimon , which funds projects to increase acceptance of cultural diversity and the integration of foreigners . a third program , xenos , aimed at promoting respect , tolerance and understanding for foreigners in schools and on the job , is financed by the eu 's european social funds . since 2001 , around 3,600 projects and initiatives under these three organizations have received more than 154 million euros in funding . including other forms of extremism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen 's ministry wants the funding to extend to other forms of extremism the cdu and the ministry for families headed by ursula von der leyen has signaled that it would like to restructure the funding of these programs in order to support initiatives against left-wing and islamic extremism .
as a result , programs aimed solely at right-wing extremism could find themselves with less money to spend . politicians from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the greens and the left party have particularly criticized the cdu 's inclusion of left-wing extremism in its proposal , saying it simply is n't a big problem in germany . " the cdu is being completely irrational in its suggestion that there are problems with extreme left-wingers in eastern germany , " uwe karsten-heye , former government spokesman and head of the pro-tolerance program gesicht zeigen -lrb- show your face -rrb- , told der spiegel . less funding , he said , would " destroy everything that we 've worked so hard to set in motion . " " if there was an acute threat from left-wing extremists in germany , then i would support the views of the cdu , " said bundestag vice president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- .
" violence , no matter what political motivation it stems from , has to be fought .
but we do n't have any serious problems with left-wing extremism in germany at present ; the statistics are clear on that . " thierse added that the spd was working hard to ensure that the work of programs such as civitas , xenos and entimon would continue .
curtailing their funding now , he said , would be the " wrong signal . " " savings potential " but with funding up for review , some within the cdu have said that now is the right time to consider the diversity and success rate of the many projects targeting racism and hate crimes . " not everything that is meant well is also done well , " said cdu parliamentarian kristina köhler .
" a savings potential when it comes to these projects is definitely there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say anti-semitism and other forms of racism are on the rise in germany germany 's umbrella organization for these projects , the federal association for democracy and tolerance -lrb- bfdt -rrb- , however , said there was still untapped potential in the diversity of initiatives that have received funding in recent years . " we have n't yet exhausted all the possibilities , " said the bfdt 's deputy managing director , reiner schiller-dickhut .
" my wish would be for more evaluation of the various projects , so that we could have a more systematic transfer of knowledge and experience .
my concern is that the expertise we 've gathered over the past few years is not being implemented as fully as it could be . " more expected on local level something that most everyone in the debate can agree on is the need for more action at the local and regional levels to quash the spread of xenophobia and racist violence in germany . " it 's important that the state and regional authorities also do their share and not just look to the federal level , " said thierse . and in an internet chat on german broadcaster ard 's web site on the weekend , klaus schroeder , an expert on right-wing extremism at berlin 's freie university , suggested that action on the community level was the most surefire method of preventing young people from seeking out the far-right scene in the first place . " only if the problem is a topic of discussion in the smaller circles - in the family , within the peer group , etc . , is there a chance to limit the damage , " schroeder said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged racial attack becomes political issue an attack on an ethiopian-german in the city of potsdam has turned into a political tussle , with officials and organizations bickering over the attack 's motives , public remarks and who should be investigating the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.04.2006 telling tales to combat juvenile violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can fairy tales help immigrants learn german ?
reports of teenage violence amongst immigrants that hit the headlines in march triggered a number of local initiatives to combat the problem , including one unusual project at a berlin elementary school . after police were called in to crack down on violence in a berlin high school , recent weeks have seen the issue of immigration return to the top of germany 's social agenda .
politicians across the board convinced that addressing language skills needs to be the first step forward . but that 's easier said than done .
schools across the country have been brainstorming to find how best to get children with non-german mother tongues up to speed before their failure to keep pace slides into anti-social behavior . the cross-cultural appeal of fairytales it might sound like a tall tale , but one berlin school has decided to counter the harsh realities of inner-city immigrant life with flights of fantasy , dreaming up a project monitored by researchers from berlin 's udk art school in which first graders are read a fairy tale twice a week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little red riding hood has universal appeal with 80 percent of the pupils at the anna lindh elementary school hailing from immigrant families , language tests conducted both before and after the school year will show whether or not the experiment has helped the children 's linguistic progress . bringing stories alive the stories are read by professional actors .
rather than sitting at the front of the class reading aloud in a time-honored tradition guaranteed to put the average six-year-old to sleep in five minutes , they use liberal doses of pantomime , altering their voice and expression and bringing the stories to life in a way the children can grasp even when they do n't understand every word .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors helps bring the stories alive sabine kolbe , who trained at the udk , says that when she first began the job , the children were restless and easily distracted .
but it was n't long before she noticed a change in their attitude . " listening and recognizing language patterns has an immediate impact , " she explained , and points out that the story-telling process also provides plenty of opportunity to learn new vocabulary .
" when we read the grimm brothers ' ' the seven ravens , ' we came across the word ' jug ' and no one knew what it was . so i brought one in the next time and the children learned a new word . " pessimism the initiative was the brainchild of marie-agnes von stechow , a 61-year-old expert in german language and literature who tutors struggling school children .
in her experience , many of them have far more pressing problems than learning to read and write .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : language skills are key to integration " i 've been doing this kind of work for five years and i 've seen how urgently these children need help , " she said .
" they have no idea what 's to become of them .
i once asked a 10-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up , and he said he 'd never get a job anyway so it did n't matter .
they know their horizons are limited and that stops them from making any effort to learn . " von stechow is convinced that the roots of this pessimism lie in linguistic isolation .
" language is the only way to reach out to them and make them equal members of society , " she insisted . getting the ball rolling after the deutsche bank foundation pledged 32,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,400 -rrb- of support , she joined forces with the anna lindh elementary school and the udk art school to design a project she 's confident will be a boon to children who come from other cultures .
the underlying principle is that fairy tales have universal appeal - in any language . " -lrb- the project -rrb- is about sitting together and listening , while linguistically , words and sentences are often repeated , which allows for better understanding , " she said . that 's not all , she insisted .
the fascination of fairy tales is as much about content as language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the brothers grimm solve germany 's problems ?
" in fairytales , conflicts tend to be solved in a very simple way that children can easily understand , " she pointed out .
" moreover , the whole process is an enjoyable one which improves kids ' imagination and motivates them to read . " initially limited to two years , the scheme at the anna lindh school is still the only one of its kind in germany .
but marie-agnes von stechow hopes it wo n't be long before other schools realize that telling tales is n't always a bad thing . bianca von der au -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett .
-lrb- march 21 , 2006 -rrb- no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .
berlin ’ s education senator is coming under heavy criticism for refusing to close the secondary school down .

president martin torrijos described the project as a " formidable challenge " but necessary if the canal is to retain its place as a key route for global cargo .
the plan is due to be put to a national referendum later this year .
polls suggest the majority of voters back the project , which is set to create several thousands jobs .
in a televised speech , mr torrijos said the plan was , " the most important decision about the canal and its role in the 21st century " .
the 80km -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- canal links the pacific and atlantic oceans and plays a vital role in global trade .
around 40 ships a day pass through its system of locks and lakes .
sensitive issue but , partly because of surging exports from china , the canal 's capacity is now stretched .
it also faces the prospect of missing out on business from a new generation of super-ships , which can carry up to twice as much cargo as normal vessels .
panama canal facts handles an estimated 5 % of world trade the main goods shipped are oil products , grain and container cargo last year the canal handled 14,000 transits , shipping 200 million tonnes of cargo traffic between asia and the east coast of the us accounts for more than 40 % of shipping the panama government fears its income from tolls will fall if ship-owners switch to alternative routes , bbc americas editor simon watts says .
that is why they are proposing a new set of giant locks , measuring more than 50m wide , to create a third lane of traffic that is capable of handling wider loads .
" the panama canal route is facing competition , " mr torrijos said .
" if we do not meet the challenge to continue to give a competitive service , other routes will emerge that will replace ours .
" it would be unforgivable to refuse to improve the capacity of the waterway . "
the canal is a sensitive issue in panama so mr torrijos has tried to take party politics out of his proposal , our correspondent says .
he has consulted widely , and the plan needs to be passed by parliament as well as through a referendum .
but panamanians will want to know exactly how the plan will be financed , and mr torrijos will also need to address a widespread feeling that ordinary people have not seen any benefit from canal revenue , our correspondent adds .
the canal was opened in 1914 and run by the us until it was handed to the panama government in 1999 .

president martin torrijos described the project as a " formidable challenge " but necessary if the canal is to retain its place as a key route for global cargo .
the plan is due to be put to a national referendum later this year .
polls suggest the majority of voters back the project , which is set to create several thousands jobs .
in a televised speech , mr torrijos said the plan was , " the most important decision about the canal and its role in the 21st century " .

the 51-year-old will quit the post with immediate effect , but will stay on at the company in the role of chairman .
sun 's current president and chief operating officer jonathan schwartz will take over at the helm of the firm .
the news came as the us firm revealed third quarter losses had widened to $ 217m -lrb- £ 121.4m -rrb- from $ 28m at the same time a year ago .
sun blamed a number of mainly merger-related charges for the fall - excluding the one-off costs losses fell to just 1 cent per share .
meanwhile , revenues for the three months to 26 march rose 21 % to $ 3.18bn.
share woes shares in the company are currently languishing around 90 % lower than the highs hit during the dotcom boom of 2000 .
the fall came despite the firm 's transformation into a major force in high-end computing , and recently offering smaller machines for simpler tasks .

the 51-year-old will quit the post with immediate effect , but will stay on at the company in the role of chairman .
sun 's current president and chief operating officer jonathan schwartz will take over at the helm of the firm .
the news came as the us firm revealed third quarter losses had widened to $ 217m -lrb- £ 121.4m -rrb- from $ 28m at the same time a year ago .
sun blamed a number of mainly merger-related charges for the fall - excluding the one-off costs losses fell to just 1 cent per share .
meanwhile , revenues for the three months to 26 march rose 21 % to $ 3.18bn.
share woes shares in the company are currently languishing around 90 % lower than the highs hit during the dotcom boom of 2000 .
the fall came despite the firm 's transformation into a major force in high-end computing , and recently offering smaller machines for simpler tasks .
" i do n't think -lsb- mr mcnealy -rsb- was reading the tea leaves accurately enough to allow his business to grow in this new decade . ...
the first 18 years were stellar , " said retired wall street analyst john jones , who used to follow sun .
but , mr mcnealy has vowed to continue to play a big part at the company , focusing on developing its governmental and academic ties around the world .
" this is n't about me .
it 's about a big moment in sun 's history and i 'm proud to share that with you , " he said .
" there 's lots more work to do and i 'm certainly going to stay around and support that . "
shares in the firm jumped following the announcement , rising 6 % to $ 5.29 in after-hours trade .
the stock closed on nasdaq at $ 4.98 .
microsoft tussles mr mcnealy , who co-founded sun in 1982 , helped grow it into one of the dominant providers of large computer servers .
however after the dotcom bubble crash in 2000 he saw revenues fall and frequently came under pressure for not cutting costs enough .
he had a number of run-ins with microsoft , calling its windows operating system a " hairball " and its outlook e-mail program " look out " after it was hit by a number of viruses .
the two companies also clashed in court , with sun filing an anti-trust suit against microsoft .
the firms settled the case in 2004 for $ 1.6bn.

the explosions occurred in a bustling area popular with tourists during the early evening when many people would have been out in cafes and restaurants .
eyewitnesses spoke of seeing debris and body parts in the streets .
southern sinai peninsula resorts have been hit before .
about 60 people were killed in sharm el-sheikh last july .
most of the dead were egyptians , who had been enjoying a spring holiday in dahab when the attacks occurred .
a german boy was among three foreigners killed .
some officials were quoted as saying the attacks were the work of suicide bombers , but others said it was too early to say .
there has been no immediate claim of responsibility .
there were lots of bodies around , people running with blood coming out of their faces australian tourist owen norris witnesses tell of horror in pictures : dahab blasts uk condemns attacks the attacks received swift international condemnation .
egyptian president hosni mubarak called the explosions a " wicked terrorist act " , and us president george w bush described it as " heinous " .
the hamas-led palestinian government said it " strongly condemns this criminal act which flouts our religion , shakes palestinian national security and works against arab interests " .
israel 's ambassador in cairo urged israelis in sinai to leave immediately , and a stream of israeli cars were reportedly heading to the israeli border at taba by late evening .
' like war ' the three explosions happened in quick succession at about 1900 -lrb- 1700gmt -rrb- in what is a small , low-key resort popular with western backpackers , budget israeli tourists and scuba-divers .
several restaurants , shops and a supermarket were destroyed in the main tourist street close to the seafront during one of the busiest times of the day .

" i 'd never seen anything like it before , a child , a baby , blood everywhere , the smell of burnt skin , of burnt hair . "
the bbc 's mark perrow in dahab saw people sitting dazed near to where the explosions took place as police set up cordons .
the roads in and out of dahab were being controlled by checkpoints and a virtual curfew existed overnight in the town , our correspondent says .
the emergency services were quickly on the scene , and many volunteers rushed to the town 's small hospital to give blood .
the worst of the injured were driven 80 kilometres -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- for treatment at sharm el-sheikh or flown on to the capital , cairo .
among the 62 wounded there were three danes , three britons , two italians , two germans , two french people , a south korean , a lebanese , a palestinian , an american , an israeli and an australian .
militant group dahab , which means gold in arabic , lies on the coast of the gulf of aqaba , about 100 kilometres -lrb- 65 miles -rrb- south of the border with israel .
in july 2005 , more than 60 people died in a bomb attack in the tourist area of the resort town of sharm al-sheikh , further south along the coast .
the bbc 's heba saleh says the egyptian authorities have uncovered a militant group active in the sinai , but they have said very little about it .
the group is also thought to have been responsible for bombings in the resort of taba in october 2004 , when 34 people were killed .

two of six cows which died at ynys gau farm , at gwaelod-y-garth , near cardiff , were infected with the disease .
tests are still being carried out to identify the source of the disease , but mr jones said vets believed it was a pool on the site .
but he said the disease was confined to the farm and was " under control " .
it was confirmed on sunday that two cows had died of anthrax at ynys gau farm , which also tested positive for anthrax 35 years ago .
this is a disease that 's contained on the farm - the risk to people is exceptionally low carwyn jones the last case of the disease in britain was in 2002 when a cow died at a farm in wrexham , north wales .
ynys gau farm has been sealed off , with the carcasses of the dead cows incinerated and footpaths across the farmland closed .
restrictions will remain in place while work to identify the source continues and the remaining cattle on the farm will be monitored .
but mr jones said there had been progress on finding the disease source .
he said : " vets believe they have identified the source at a particular pool on the farm .
" they are investigating whether that is the source of the outbreak and once that is confirmed , steps will be taken to deal with it . "
seven cows died of anthrax at ynys gau farm 35 years ago mr jones said he was satisfied the anthrax was contained within the farm .
" this is a one-off incident , " he said .
" we did actually have a case of anthrax in 2002 in wrexham - it 's uncommon but it does happen from time to time .
" the disease itself is on the farm rather than having been brought there from somewhere else so it is under control .
" i do n't think it will spread .
nothing has moved off the form for more than a year .
" this is a disease that 's contained on the farm - the risk to people is exceptionally low . "
past cases health officials have also stressed that there is little risk to people from the anthrax outbreak on the farm .
wales ' chief veterinary officer , dr christianne glossop , said the outbreak was likely to be linked to the cases at the same farm 35 years ago and that she was confident that the incident had been contained .
dr glossop said testing of the farmland , to identify the most likely source of infection was likely to take days rather than weeks .
tests for anthrax on two more dead cows at the farm were negative , but farming unions have expressed concern at the outbreak .
neil smith of the farmers ' union of wales said : " the farmers will be afraid because we are still on the tail of foot-and-mouth .

wales ' chief veterinary officer , dr christianne glossop , said the outbreak was likely to be linked to the cases at the same farm 35 years ago and that she was confident that the incident had been contained .
dr glossop said testing of the farmland , to identify the most likely source of infection was likely to take days rather than weeks .
tests for anthrax on two more dead cows at the farm were negative , but farming unions have expressed concern at the outbreak .
neil smith of the farmers ' union of wales said : " the farmers will be afraid because we are still on the tail of foot-and-mouth .
" the industry has n't recovered from foot-and-mouth yet . "

the people loved him .
the labour party came to loathe him .
once he had been the darling of valleys labour , fighting for the party 's socialist values in an area where the hallowed names of aneurin bevan and michael foot reverberated .
his proudest moment was his ministerial appointment to alun michael 's first labour government in the national assembly .
but all that was to change .
alun michael resigned ; a minority government was replaced by a coalition pact with the liberal democrats and rhodri morgan , the new first minister , sacked peter law .
the bitterness and hurt which that caused is the key to what happened subsequently .
peter law once told me that if he had been supported by labour in his attempt to be the deputy presiding officer in the assembly - a kind of consolation prize for his demotion - things may have turned out very differently . "
he has finally lost the last battle but to the end he continued to enjoy above all else - the support of the people of blaenau gwent " it was n't to be .
peter law was a rebel looking for a cause and it came when his party decided to impose an all women short list in his constituency of blaenau gwent .
it was an issue peter law was passionately opposed to and he decided to stand against the party 's official candidate maggie jones in the 2005 general election .
but he was to pay a heavy personal price for that decision.the labour party has never forgiven him .
his stance , though , touched a rare political nerve - a politician and his people speaking as one .
in last year 's general election , an adoring electorate swept their rebel hero to a sensational victory in what had been the safest labour seat in wales .
the citadel had fallen .
this was drama enough , but the days leading up to this remarkable general election upset were - if it 's possible - even more dramatic .
this was drama of a different kind .
it was very personal and very poignant .
on the very day that peter law was to announce that he was standing against his own party he announced instead that he had a brain tumour and was pulling out of the race before it began .
in an emotional and often tearful interview he told me that his medical condition meant that he had to go into hospital immediately and undergo surgery .
at the time - 6 april 2005 - i wrote : " what should have been the story of the general election campaign in wales had ended before it began . "
within a couple of weeks i was writing another story - the remarkable story of peter law 's comeback .
against all the odds he had made a swift recovery from his operation to remove a brain tumour and had decided that he would , after all , be standing as an independent candidate in the general election .
the announcement sent a shiver down the labour party spine .
the party had not understood peter law 's enormous determination and resilience .
his popularity - already reaching adulation proportions - was further enhanced by his decision to stand .
the labour party and its candidate were doomed .
peter law was walking on political water and he walked straight into parliament with a thumping majority of just over 9,000 .
he also retained his assembly seat which , at a stroke , denied the labour government in cardiff bay its majority of one .
the potential for political mischief by the opposition parties was quickly realised and peter law was soon in the vanguard of campaigns to defeat his old party .
you could n't help feeling that peter law enjoyed those moments very much , but they only served to heighten the animosity some in the labour party felt towards their former colleague .
peter law was fighting against his old party , but in doing so he was fighting his own demons .
more recently he had , once again , been fighting for his health and for his life .
now he has finally lost the last battle but to the end he continued to enjoy above all else - the support of the people of blaenau gwent .
before he died he heard that the labour party had decided not to use an all woman shortlist to select its next parliamentary candidate .
and maggie jones ?
well , she has been given a peerage !
peter law died believing he was right all along .

the people loved him .
the labour party came to loathe him .
once he had been the darling of valleys labour , fighting for the party 's socialist values in an area where the hallowed names of aneurin bevan and michael foot reverberated .
his proudest moment was his ministerial appointment to alun michael 's first labour government in the national assembly .
but all that was to change .
alun michael resigned ; a minority government was replaced by a coalition pact with the liberal democrats and rhodri morgan , the new first minister , sacked peter law .
the bitterness and hurt which that caused is the key to what happened subsequently .
peter law once told me that if he had been supported by labour in his attempt to be the deputy presiding officer in the assembly - a kind of consolation prize for his demotion - things may have turned out very differently .

peter law was a rebel looking for a cause and it came when his party decided to impose an all women short list in his constituency of blaenau gwent .
it was an issue peter law was passionately opposed to and he decided to stand against the party 's official candidate maggie jones in the 2005 general election .
but he was to pay a heavy personal price for that decision.the labour party has never forgiven him .
his stance , though , touched a rare political nerve - a politician and his people speaking as one .
in last year 's general election , an adoring electorate swept their rebel hero to a sensational victory in what had been the safest labour seat in wales .
the citadel had fallen .
this was drama enough , but the days leading up to this remarkable general election upset were - if it 's possible - even more dramatic .
this was drama of a different kind .
it was very personal and very poignant .
on the very day that peter law was to announce that he was standing against his own party he announced instead that he had a brain tumour and was pulling out of the race before it began .
in an emotional and often tearful interview he told me that his medical condition meant that he had to go into hospital immediately and undergo surgery .

against all the odds he had made a swift recovery from his operation to remove a brain tumour and had decided that he would , after all , be standing as an independent candidate in the general election .
the announcement sent a shiver down the labour party spine .
the party had not understood peter law 's enormous determination and resilience .
his popularity - already reaching adulation proportions - was further enhanced by his decision to stand .
the labour party and its candidate were doomed .
peter law was walking on political water and he walked straight into parliament with a thumping majority of just over 9,000 .
he also retained his assembly seat which , at a stroke , denied the labour government in cardiff bay its majority of one .
the potential for political mischief by the opposition parties was quickly realised and peter law was soon in the vanguard of campaigns to defeat his old party .
you could n't help feeling that peter law enjoyed those moments very much , but they only served to heighten the animosity some in the labour party felt towards their former colleague .
peter law was fighting against his old party , but in doing so he was fighting his own demons .
more recently he had , once again , been fighting for his health and for his life .

ms young says social entrepreneurs get things done in the 21st century it may be time for something new : social entrepreneurship , for example .
it means taking a business eye to the problems of society , and then applying a business imperative to get things done , but without the profit motive .
i think this is terribly important , and so -lrb- luckily -rrb- do people with the money to invest in it -lrb- unlike me , that is -rrb- .
social entrepreneurship is getting a lot of attention .
even business schools are waking up to it as a subject that needs to be taught .
at the said business school in oxford the other day , rowena young told me how they are teaching it there , and how keen people both inside and outside the university are to learn about it .
she is director of the school 's skoll centre for social entrepreneurship .
a changing society gives social entrepreneurs new objectives she says : they may come up with unconventional ways of addressing the problems of a rapidly ageing population , for example .
this is different from the charity approach , says rowena young .
they say how do we grow ?
social entrepreneurs ask how to resolve the issue , and move on to the next one , just like business entrepreneurs .
social conscience the said school is only 10 years old , but it is already producing its own ex student social entrepreneurs , such as clean start energy making bio-diesel fuel in india with founders only one year out of college .
professor yunus spearheaded unsecured lending to the poor the fuel comes from a weed which was taking over the land of poor farmers .
if you want to , half your oxford mba can come from studying social and environmental innovation .
business students , says ms young , want increasingly to marry their values to their professional careers without having to make a choice between the two .
she says it is a growing trend for people under 35 ; big businesses will ignore it at their peril .
lending money the said school is also where the skoll foundation -lrb- based in silicon valley usa -rrb- has funded this department to study social entrepreneurship , and where it holds an annual conference , bringing commentators and entrepreneurs together from all over the world .
ms hale wants to use big pharma 's existing discoveries the skoll in question is jeff skoll , a still young businessman who made a fortune as president of ebay , but who now devotes himself to backing films and encouraging social entrepreneurs in a hurry to change the world .
one of the social entrepreneurs i met in oxford as professor muhammad yunis , founder of the now famous grameen bank in bangladesh .
he is one of a huddle of new microlenders who are changing the lives of poor people by lending small sums of money to them , without the conventional security to lend on : collateral such as property , which is what most banks require to offset a loan .
shelved drugs the second social entrepreneur i listened to in oxford was victoria hale .
she is the founder of the institute for oneworld health , a pharmaceutical company based in san francisco set up not to make profits but to do good , perhaps huge good .
she is doing something that the people who run " big pharma " , the world 's leading drug companies , can not imagine ever succeeding .
ms hale is trying to create new medicines to treat illnesses common among poor people in places such as africa .
and where does a not-for-profit pharmaceutical company find its new drugs ?
simple , she says on the shelves of big pharma .
her message to the big companies is : let us have your drugs that for some reason failed to dazzle the first time around , drugs stuck in the company vaults .
and they do : the big companies are the ones who are making the institute possible .
they have discovered and identified hundreds if not thousands of new compounds which have failed : not effective at the task they were produced for , unsuitable side effects , too small a market place for the huge costs the international giants have seen become a norm in their particular big lab , blockbuster drug model of the business .
more needed ms hale , social entrepreneur and pharmacologist , says there is another model of how to develop drugs .
oneworld health can only do its job because big pharma is still profligate in the way it produces potential drugs .
but it also suggests that there are huge inefficiencies in the way western world drugs are currently devised and produced .
challenging the system does not come cheap : among the backers of oneworld health is the bill and melinda gates foundation , which has given victoria hale $ 140m to change the way drugs are produced for the poor .
but we need dozens , no hundreds , more social entrepreneurs to change the way everything is done : to spot a gap in the social marketplace and fill it , with a motive other than profit .
they are on their way .
work in progress is the title of this exploration of the big trends reshaping the world of work as we steam further into the 21st century ; and it is a work in progress , influenced and defined by my encounters as i report on trends in business and organisations all over the world .

ms young says social entrepreneurs get things done in the 21st century it may be time for something new : social entrepreneurship , for example .
it means taking a business eye to the problems of society , and then applying a business imperative to get things done , but without the profit motive .
i think this is terribly important , and so -lrb- luckily -rrb- do people with the money to invest in it -lrb- unlike me , that is -rrb- .
social entrepreneurship is getting a lot of attention .

at the said business school in oxford the other day , rowena young told me how they are teaching it there , and how keen people both inside and outside the university are to learn about it .

a changing society gives social entrepreneurs new objectives she says : they may come up with unconventional ways of addressing the problems of a rapidly ageing population , for example .

readers within the uk are not being sampled as the proposal is that the sites will remain free of adverts to them when they log on .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- vit d linked to baby birth weight bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes tuesday , 25 april 2006 , 07:42 gmt 08:42 uk vit d linked to baby birth weight low vitamin d intake during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weights in babies , according to a study .
the research compared babies ' birth weights with the amount of vitamin d fortified milk and vitamin d supplements women took while pregnant .
the researchers from mcgill university , canada , suggest the study shows vitamin d may be an important regulator for foetal growth .
the study is published in the canadian medical association journal .
the study involved over 300 pregnant women , based in canada , who were asked to fill in questionnaires about their diet and lifestyle .
this included information about how much milk they consumed and the dietary supplements taken . "
there is a lot of dispute between scientists as to how much is the optimal amount to take a day " dr gail goldberg , mrc milk contains protein , riboflavins and calcium , but in canada it is fortified with vitamin d. sunlight is the normal source for vitamin d , but many people have vitamin d deficiencies , and it is difficult to get from common food sources .
weight gains the researchers discovered that women who drank less than 250ml of fortified milk a day had lower intakes of vitamin d and protein than women who drank more than this amount .
after recording the birth weights of the infants , the researchers found that women who drank less milk and had lower intakes of vitamin d were more likely to give birth to smaller babies .
they discovered that as the intake of fortified milk increased , birth weight went up , and for every extra 250ml drunk a day , there was an increase of 41g in birth weight .
an increase of one microgram of vitamin d per day was linked to an 11g rise in birth weight .
the level of protein , riboflavin and calcium were not found to be linked to the weight of the babies .
the authors of the paper are worried that increasingly women choose , or are advised to , restrict milk during pregnancy .
they do this for a number of reasons , including lactose intolerance or wanting to prevent childhood allergies .
developing babies but the scientists believe milk and vitamin d are important sources of nutrition during pregnancy , and say the study shows their importance for childhood development .
in an accompanying commentary in the journal , professor bruce hollis of the medical university of south carolina , us , highlighted the importance of vitamin d , and said it may be linked to neurodevelopment , immune function and chronic disease susceptibility in developing babies , as well as birth weight .
" this paper is important because it shows the benefit of very small amounts of vitamin d , " he said .
" if we could get this level to meaningful amounts , the effects could be dramatic . "
dr gail goldberg , a nutritionist from the medical research council ' human nutrition research centre , cambridge , uk , said : " this is an interesting study , and very topical as there is a lot of interest in this area .
" in canada , milk is fortified , and a lot of the vitamin d intake seems to come from this source . "
" in other countries , sunlight or supplements are the main source as it is not found in common foods , but there is a lot of dispute between scientists as to how much is the optimal amount to take a day . "
