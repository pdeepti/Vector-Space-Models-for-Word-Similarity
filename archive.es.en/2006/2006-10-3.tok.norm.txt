production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .

but that decision led to major snags .

supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

" cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .

supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .
next year 's event will highlight catalonia followed by turkey in 2008 . the event will wrap up sunday , oct .
8 with the awarding of the prestigious german booksellers ' peace prize to german sociologist wolf lepenies .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .
i find a bit of that in cologne - and when i 'm writing , " she added . life writes the most intense dramas faye cukier has said that some of her experiences were not unlike those of anne frank , the german-born jewish girl who wrote her famous diary while her family was hiding in nazi-occupied amsterdam . she said that with the publication of her book this year in english , she hopes it will arouse interest among german publishers . sadly , one might otherwise be left to conclude that only holocaust victims and writers who died in concentration camps - like anne frank - or those who managed to survive them - like elie wiesel - merit publication . while on her current trip to cologne , however , cukier has begun giving readings in english and talks in german from her book , " fleeing the swastika . "
audiences there , at least , would like to be able to read her story in german - if publishers ever decide to print it . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .

culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change .

" today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us .

his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .
i find a bit of that in cologne - and when i 'm writing , " she added . life writes the most intense dramas faye cukier has said that some of her experiences were not unlike those of anne frank , the german-born jewish girl who wrote her famous diary while her family was hiding in nazi-occupied amsterdam . she said that with the publication of her book this year in english , she hopes it will arouse interest among german publishers . sadly , one might otherwise be left to conclude that only holocaust victims and writers who died in concentration camps - like anne frank - or those who managed to survive them - like elie wiesel - merit publication . while on her current trip to cologne , however , cukier has begun giving readings in english and talks in german from her book , " fleeing the swastika . "
audiences there , at least , would like to be able to read her story in german - if publishers ever decide to print it . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .
i find a bit of that in cologne - and when i 'm writing , " she added . life writes the most intense dramas faye cukier has said that some of her experiences were not unlike those of anne frank , the german-born jewish girl who wrote her famous diary while her family was hiding in nazi-occupied amsterdam . she said that with the publication of her book this year in english , she hopes it will arouse interest among german publishers . sadly , one might otherwise be left to conclude that only holocaust victims and writers who died in concentration camps - like anne frank - or those who managed to survive them - like elie wiesel - merit publication . while on her current trip to cologne , however , cukier has begun giving readings in english and talks in german from her book , " fleeing the swastika .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2006 cartoon controversy interviews hit danish stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon controversy raised ire across the world a new book examines how a series of caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to violent anti-danish protests in many parts of the muslim world .
but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .
last week german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted the country 's first-ever " conference on islam , " in an effort to improve the government 's interaction with muslims living here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble at germany 's first-ever " conference on islam " but cultural conflicts continue .
the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .
but the question of what , if anything , was learned from the controversy remains very much open . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : pope lacks john paul 's talent for diffusing tensions pope benedict xvi has failed to heal the rift created by his recent comments on islam due to a lack of the kind of grand gesture mastered by the more media-savvy john paul ii , analysts believe .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2006 cartoon controversy interviews hit danish stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon controversy raised ire across the world a new book examines how a series of caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to violent anti-danish protests in many parts of the muslim world .
but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .
last week german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted the country 's first-ever " conference on islam , " in an effort to improve the government 's interaction with muslims living here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble at germany 's first-ever " conference on islam " but cultural conflicts continue .
the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .
but the question of what , if anything , was learned from the controversy remains very much open . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : pope lacks john paul 's talent for diffusing tensions pope benedict xvi has failed to heal the rift created by his recent comments on islam due to a lack of the kind of grand gesture mastered by the more media-savvy john paul ii , analysts believe .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon .
-lrb- 28.09.2006 -rrb- political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .
the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .

the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2006 germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 16 years on , reunification no longer stirs strong emotions in germany as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event . two years ago , former german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to practically abolish german unity day , which is celebrated every year on oct .
3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best .

right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets .

" he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .
next year 's event will highlight catalonia followed by turkey in 2008 . the event will wrap up sunday , oct .

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's summit made little progress monday 's meeting of experts to try to bridge the differences over the plan , which also includes cutbacks in subsidies for health insurance cover such as children sickness pay and maternity payments , follows their failure to reach an accord at marathon talks last thursday . " it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2006 cartoon controversy interviews hit danish stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon controversy raised ire across the world a new book examines how a series of caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to violent anti-danish protests in many parts of the muslim world .
but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .
last week german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted the country 's first-ever " conference on islam , " in an effort to improve the government 's interaction with muslims living here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble at germany 's first-ever " conference on islam " but cultural conflicts continue .
the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .
but the question of what , if anything , was learned from the controversy remains very much open . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : pope lacks john paul 's talent for diffusing tensions pope benedict xvi has failed to heal the rift created by his recent comments on islam due to a lack of the kind of grand gesture mastered by the more media-savvy john paul ii , analysts believe .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .
next year 's event will highlight catalonia followed by turkey in 2008 . the event will wrap up sunday , oct .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us .

" the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .

islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2006 germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 16 years on , reunification no longer stirs strong emotions in germany as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event . two years ago , former german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to practically abolish german unity day , which is celebrated every year on oct .
3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .

" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing .

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's summit made little progress monday 's meeting of experts to try to bridge the differences over the plan , which also includes cutbacks in subsidies for health insurance cover such as children sickness pay and maternity payments , follows their failure to reach an accord at marathon talks last thursday . " it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .
" this means that contributions may not have to increase . " dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's summit made little progress monday 's meeting of experts to try to bridge the differences over the plan , which also includes cutbacks in subsidies for health insurance cover such as children sickness pay and maternity payments , follows their failure to reach an accord at marathon talks last thursday . " it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo christian streiff is in charge of restructuring to keep all the partners happy , the company 's former managers decided to split production between various countries .
but that decision led to major snags .

supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .

but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

3 , 1990 on oct .
3 germans sleep late and barbeque if the weather 's good .
ahead of the unification day , 16 years after the joining of east and west , newspapers commented on the challenge of integration and the status quo . " as the german division came to an end 16 years ago , it began again .
the new division is not between east and west , but between east and east , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung monday from munich .
" today there are two easts in germany : the booming east and the declining east . "
" silicon saxony , " jena and leipzig are flourishing , but anklam and uckermark are becoming more and more desolate , continued the paper .
democratic defeatism " is not the result of a political genetic defect , but of the real and alleged experiences of many people in the east .
the west germans had the fortune of experiencing democracy parallel to the " economic miracle " in the 50s and 60s ; they experienced democracy as a form of government in which their lives improved .
thirty years later , many east germans experienced the opposite . " " only one-quarter of those in former east germany is content with the functioning of democracy .
in former west germany , it 's still one in two , " commented berlin 's daily tagesspiegel monday .
" and it should n't necessarily be the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- that teaches them they are capable of enforcing more seriousness and candor themselves .
practical political constraints require political courage and the capacity to act in a democracy .
they do n't require lies .
sixteen years after german unification might just be the right time to remember that . " the daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote in its monday edition , " germans have made progress with integration in the day-to-day things , " it wrote , pointing out that clichés like that of the ever complaining easterner or the westerner always knowing better have n't entirely disappeared yet , but they 've become out-dated and they 're used less frequently .
" now the ideological fights are more about whether it 's nicer to go on vacation to -lrb- the baltic sea islands of -rrb- rügen -lrb- which had been part of east germany -rrb- or föhr -lrb- which had been part of west germany -rrb- . " " appeals here , parties there .
these wo n't be lacking on unification day , " wrote the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on monday .
" chancellor angela merkel has already made her message clear and called for greater willingness in the west for rebuilding in the east .
it might sound severe , but she 's not going to achieve it , " continued the paper .
" why should the citizens do more than big daddy state is already doing ?
for years , the state has been spending billions on pretty facades , which does n't really improve what 's behind them .
in any case , the willingness to pay is not going to increase .
considering the higher taxes everywhere , it 's more likely to decline .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .
next year 's event will highlight catalonia followed by turkey in 2008 . the event will wrap up sunday , oct .
8 with the awarding of the prestigious german booksellers ' peace prize to german sociologist wolf lepenies .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair " bombay is a city of extremes " literature -pipe- 03.10.2006 " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri says indian writing in english has become increasingly heterogenous ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country . amit chaudhuri is one india ’ s most important contemporary writers in english as well as a sought-after essayist and literary critic who has worked for the guardian and the times literary supplement .
his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .
i find a bit of that in cologne - and when i 'm writing , " she added . life writes the most intense dramas faye cukier has said that some of her experiences were not unlike those of anne frank , the german-born jewish girl who wrote her famous diary while her family was hiding in nazi-occupied amsterdam . she said that with the publication of her book this year in english , she hopes it will arouse interest among german publishers . sadly , one might otherwise be left to conclude that only holocaust victims and writers who died in concentration camps - like anne frank - or those who managed to survive them - like elie wiesel - merit publication . while on her current trip to cologne , however , cukier has begun giving readings in english and talks in german from her book , " fleeing the swastika .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .

but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .

the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's summit made little progress monday 's meeting of experts to try to bridge the differences over the plan , which also includes cutbacks in subsidies for health insurance cover such as children sickness pay and maternity payments , follows their failure to reach an accord at marathon talks last thursday . " it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .

supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .

they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .

they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2006 cartoon controversy interviews hit danish stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon controversy raised ire across the world a new book examines how a series of caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to violent anti-danish protests in many parts of the muslim world .
but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .
last week german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted the country 's first-ever " conference on islam , " in an effort to improve the government 's interaction with muslims living here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble at germany 's first-ever " conference on islam " but cultural conflicts continue .
the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .
but the question of what , if anything , was learned from the controversy remains very much open . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : pope lacks john paul 's talent for diffusing tensions pope benedict xvi has failed to heal the rift created by his recent comments on islam due to a lack of the kind of grand gesture mastered by the more media-savvy john paul ii , analysts believe .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .
but one basic question needs to be answered : " just who are these muslims ? " says dw-world.de 's loay mudhoon .
-lrb- 28.09.2006 -rrb- political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .
the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2006 germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 16 years on , reunification no longer stirs strong emotions in germany as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event . two years ago , former german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to practically abolish german unity day , which is celebrated every year on oct .
3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo christian streiff is in charge of restructuring to keep all the partners happy , the company 's former managers decided to split production between various countries .
but that decision led to major snags .
software developed in hamburg , for example , proved to be incompatible with that made in toulouse .
supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .
the plane that was supposed to give airbus a leg up on its competitor boeing has turned out instead to have put the company in a deep hole . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more delays ahead for airbus a380 super jumbo jet europe 's largest aerospace group eads warned of new delays in deliveries of its airbus a380 super jumbo airliner thursday , implying a second big setback for the group in three months .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story .

there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .

they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .

most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets .

the west germans had the fortune of experiencing democracy parallel to the " economic miracle " in the 50s and 60s ; they experienced democracy as a form of government in which their lives improved .
thirty years later , many east germans experienced the opposite . " " only one-quarter of those in former east germany is content with the functioning of democracy .
in former west germany , it 's still one in two , " commented berlin 's daily tagesspiegel monday .
" and it should n't necessarily be the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- that teaches them they are capable of enforcing more seriousness and candor themselves .
practical political constraints require political courage and the capacity to act in a democracy .
they do n't require lies .
sixteen years after german unification might just be the right time to remember that . " the daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote in its monday edition , " germans have made progress with integration in the day-to-day things , " it wrote , pointing out that clichés like that of the ever complaining easterner or the westerner always knowing better have n't entirely disappeared yet , but they 've become out-dated and they 're used less frequently .
" now the ideological fights are more about whether it 's nicer to go on vacation to -lrb- the baltic sea islands of -rrb- rügen -lrb- which had been part of east germany -rrb- or föhr -lrb- which had been part of west germany -rrb- . " " appeals here , parties there .
these wo n't be lacking on unification day , " wrote the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on monday .
" chancellor angela merkel has already made her message clear and called for greater willingness in the west for rebuilding in the east .
it might sound severe , but she 's not going to achieve it , " continued the paper .
" why should the citizens do more than big daddy state is already doing ?
for years , the state has been spending billions on pretty facades , which does n't really improve what 's behind them .
in any case , the willingness to pay is not going to increase .
considering the higher taxes everywhere , it 's more likely to decline .

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's summit made little progress monday 's meeting of experts to try to bridge the differences over the plan , which also includes cutbacks in subsidies for health insurance cover such as children sickness pay and maternity payments , follows their failure to reach an accord at marathon talks last thursday . " it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .
" this means that contributions may not have to increase . " dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government 's summit made little progress monday 's meeting of experts to try to bridge the differences over the plan , which also includes cutbacks in subsidies for health insurance cover such as children sickness pay and maternity payments , follows their failure to reach an accord at marathon talks last thursday . " it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2006 cartoon controversy interviews hit danish stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cartoon controversy raised ire across the world a new book examines how a series of caricatures of the prophet mohammed led to violent anti-danish protests in many parts of the muslim world .
but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .
last week german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted the country 's first-ever " conference on islam , " in an effort to improve the government 's interaction with muslims living here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble at germany 's first-ever " conference on islam " but cultural conflicts continue .
the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .
but the question of what , if anything , was learned from the controversy remains very much open . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : pope lacks john paul 's talent for diffusing tensions pope benedict xvi has failed to heal the rift created by his recent comments on islam due to a lack of the kind of grand gesture mastered by the more media-savvy john paul ii , analysts believe .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : islam needs clearer identity in germany germany 's " conference on islam " appears to be a turning point in german-muslim relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2006 germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 16 years on , reunification no longer stirs strong emotions in germany as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event . two years ago , former german chancellor gerhard schröder tried to practically abolish german unity day , which is celebrated every year on oct .
3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair " bombay is a city of extremes " literature -pipe- 03.10.2006 indian writers in english open new chapter in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vikram chandra is among a new crop of indian writers who has won international acclaim as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves . the last time india was guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , in 1986 , the buzz was about salman rushdie .
largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .
next year 's event will highlight catalonia followed by turkey in 2008 . the event will wrap up sunday , oct .

" we are heading towards chaos , " said social democrat health expert karl lauterbach ahead of the meeting .
if the reform fails , he said , " the government 's work will be set back .

" it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .

" the book fair is a mirror of the industry 's development worldwide , " fair director jürgen boos said , hailing the rapid growth of both the event and the sector . german editions of about 55 indian books are ready for the show , but hassan acknowledged that works in hindi and english had a major advantage over those written in any of the other two dozen official languages in india , for which it is difficult to find translators . shashi tharoor , zadie smith and günter grass the event officially opened with a gala ceremony tuesday evening attended by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , indian human resources and development minister arjun singh and writer mahasweta devi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of tharoor 's books have been translated into german this year author and diplomat shashi tharoor , until recently a candidate to succeed un secretary general kofi annan , will also be in town , to present the german translation of his satirical novel " show business . " among other international literary luminaries expected are zadie smith , ken follett , günter grass , and frank schätzing , who has sold the film rights to his international bestseller " the swarm " to uma thurman . the event has zeroed in on asia in recent years , courting major players with the aim of becoming the premier showcase of literature from the region . china , the key licensing market of the future and the fair 's guest country in 2009 , has doubled its display space in frankfurt .
taiwan , thailand and japan have also massively increased their presence at the event . focus on electronic publishing the boom in electronic publishing will also be in focus this year , as well as concerns posed by internet portal google 's practice of posting scanned pages from books online which has landed it in hot water with publishers and authors . " it is a real problem , " boos said . a new system that would allow publishers to guard their copyrights by attaching conditions to reproduce content seen online is set to be unveiled at the event . the book fair also hopes to rise to the challenge posed by new media by offering a " digital market place " where software companies can promote multimedia products , particularly in academic and technical fields . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional publishing of books is increasingly challenged by the internet " the book is increasingly becoming obsolete in this sector , " stephan füssel , director of the bibliology institute at the university of mainz in western germany said , noting that major scientific publishers in germany already posted two-thirds of their publications online . the fair will also feature a " berlinale " day thursday in honor of the berlin film festival held each february . the aim of the event , which will feature screenings of a number of recent films based on novels , is to promote book fairs as prime hunting ground for hollywood hot shots scouting new material . peace prize the fair attracted about 280,000 visitors in 2005 , when south korea was the guest country .
next year 's event will highlight catalonia followed by turkey in 2008 . the event will wrap up sunday , oct .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .

but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .
last week german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted the country 's first-ever " conference on islam , " in an effort to improve the government 's interaction with muslims living here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble at germany 's first-ever " conference on islam " but cultural conflicts continue .
the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .

" it is too difficult to predict if an agreement can be reached , " said wolfgang zöller , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , also ahead of monday 's talks . health issue contributing to conservatives ' slump billed as the centerpiece of the merkel government 's reform agenda , the health plans have already led to a big slump in support for the ruling coalition . one recent poll showed the chancellor 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- tumbling to its lowest level in the popularity stakes since germany unification 16 years ago . merkel was forced to forge a grand coalition government with her party 's social democrat rivals following the inconclusive national election in september last year . of particular concern for merkel is that the planned makeover of the health service has enraged many cdu state premiers , thus making it harder for her to win support for the controversial reforms within her own party . merkel 's office denies plans to isolate her bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premiers have merkel in their sights with tensions rising over the round of attacks on merkel by cdu state premiers , her spokesman was forced monday to deny that there were moves to isolate the chancellor .
he insisted that she felt supported by her party colleagues . however , the conflict over the health reform plans has already forced the government to delay implementing the proposals by three months to april 1 . merkel 's healthcare plan was " inadequate " bert rürup , head of the chancellor 's economic advisory panel told daily süddeutsche zeitung monday , saying that it only represented " modest improvements " on the current scheme . the german health service , which is one of the world 's most expensive , has been hit by the ageing of the nation 's population and recent high unemployment and is tipped to chalk up a shortfall next year of about seven billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . to add to the woes , the government 's unpopular hefty three percentage points increase in germany 's value-added tax in january is likely to further raise the cost of drugs in the nation .
that will be a further setback to merkel 's stated aim of lowering the soaring cost of medication in germany . health insurance sector mulls legal action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health care in germany is one of europe 's costliest as a further sign of the growing pressure on merkel , germany 's private health insurance sector is threatening to take legal action over the changes .
that would include injecting more competition into the health sector through measures allowing people to transfer between schemes . one major area of difference between the social democrats and merkel 's bloc is how to share out revenue between the nation 's public and private healthcare sectors . merkel 's social democrat coalition partners have argued that with many high income earners paying into the private health service , a key step for overcoming the current health service deficit was to bring to an end the division of the germany 's health systems into a public and a private sector . moreover , the private health insurers industry group -lrb- pkv -rrb- has warned that the proposed changes could result in a steep rise in premiums for the more than eight million germans who are signed up to private health insurance funds . business leaders also have the knives out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are few fans of the german health system already deeply frustrated over the failure of the merkel-led coalition to press on with major economic reforms , german industry has roundly attacked the health proposals for likely leading to higher non-wage labor costs and as a result presenting a further hurdle to hiring people . last week , in an attempt to defuse the growing political storm surrounding her health plan , merkel suggested that funds resulting from higher tax revenue following this year 's pickup in the germany economy could be funneled into the health service and as a result head off a rise in premiums . " if we have more revenue than expected , i would suggest we take back our plans to cut tax subsidies " for the health insurance sector , the chancellor told german public television .
" this means that contributions may not have to increase . " dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .

she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .
i find a bit of that in cologne - and when i 'm writing , " she added . life writes the most intense dramas faye cukier has said that some of her experiences were not unlike those of anne frank , the german-born jewish girl who wrote her famous diary while her family was hiding in nazi-occupied amsterdam . she said that with the publication of her book this year in english , she hopes it will arouse interest among german publishers . sadly , one might otherwise be left to conclude that only holocaust victims and writers who died in concentration camps - like anne frank - or those who managed to survive them - like elie wiesel - merit publication . while on her current trip to cologne , however , cukier has begun giving readings in english and talks in german from her book , " fleeing the swastika .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo christian streiff is in charge of restructuring to keep all the partners happy , the company 's former managers decided to split production between various countries .
but that decision led to major snags .
software developed in hamburg , for example , proved to be incompatible with that made in toulouse .
supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .

supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders .

but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .

3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

" it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea . " a day for reflection on the state of germany might be more productive than a mindless celebration , " jarausch said . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : " there are two easts in germany " on oct .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .

now a us citizen , her book has been published in english because german publishers thought her story lacked sufficient drama . one german publisher told her she had not suffered enough during world war ii to warrant publication of her book . faye cukier sent her manuscript to half a dozen german publishers over the course of several years .
most of the rejection letters did not criticize the quality of her writing , but rather the lack of searing drama in her autobiographical account of surviving nazi-dominated europe . " i was really disappointed and found the whole thing to be an unpleasant experience , " cukier said . " i also found it pretty ludicrous that the one german publisher told me my suffering had n't been great enough , " she added .
she said she thought people in germany would be glad to read a story about a jewish woman surviving the holocaust rather than perishing in it . she has since had her book , fleeing the swastika , published in the united states . a story to tell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cukier could n't publish in germany had cukier and her parents not been quite so savvy , faye would not have lived to tell the tale . looking at her , one would also not believe that she is 84 years old - information which she is reluctant to disclose . indeed , cukier exudes a youthful flair with the bright scarves , bunches of dark hair and shiny jewelry she wears .
the twinkle in her eye and her mischievous grin , however , are the real hallmarks of her inner youth . " i lost my youth while hiding , " cukier said .
" i 've tried to recapture it through writing my story . " her story includes years of constantly moving from place to place so as not to be discovered by the nazis during world war ii . cologne became home her polish-jewish parents left their homeland in 1919 and settled in cologne , where faye was born three years later .
there , her father provided for the family as a scrap-metal dealer . his business did so well that the family could afford luxuries like a convertible car , which faye spent many hours in alongside her father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faye loved driving around with her father before fleeing germany while the family enjoyed the benefits of relative affluence , faye 's father gradually lost control of his business as the nazis rose to power . she and her mother left germany in 1938 on one of the last belgian tourist visas - just months before the infamous kristallnacht , or " night of broken glass , " which witnessed a nation-wide pogrom .
jewish homes , stores and synagogues were ransacked and set afire . thousands upon thousands of jews were beaten to death or sent to concentration camps . faye and her mother managed to reach antwerp , then settled in brussels , where cukier 's father joined them .
they planned to emigrate to the united states but were not able to get visas . constant fear with the nazi occupation of belgium in 1940 , life changed even more dramatically for the cukiers .
" we had to heed a 7 p.m. curfew and were forced to wear the jewish yellow star , " said faye , which she refused to do . instead , she dyed her hair blonde and visited shops - which was forbidden to jews but which a policeman advised her to do - so as to not appear jewish . during those six years in belgium , faye taught french and english and even helped a man -lrb- in whom she fell in love -rrb- sell diamonds on the black market to help her family survive . yet as the nazis ' methods of " weeding out " jews became more brutal , the cukiers were forced to go underground .
a belgian family hid them .
the family spent years in fear of being discovered - and in desperation as supplies dwindled and hunger set in . once , the gestapo paid a surprise visit to the family hiding in the apartment below .
" the father jumped out of the window , and they shot him in mid-air . "
then they took the man 's wife and daughter away , faye said . later , she witnessed how one of her family 's protectors was killed . becoming american bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german publishers have said they would look at her story again now that it 's been shortened when allied forces liberated belgium from nazi occupation in 1944 , faye 's family was also liberated , but many of her friends and relatives were not so lucky .
they perished on european streets and in concentration camps . despite the devastation , faye 's family returned to cologne after the war . faye eventually fulfilled a life-long dream by emigrating to the united states .
when she first arrived there , she sang chansons in night clubs and gave belly-dancing lessons . later , she created an american life for herself by marrying , having children and becoming a us citizen . yet , a tug deep down inside herself always brings her back to cologne .
she spends several months a year in the western german city , her hometown - because " a part of my heart is here , " she said . " i think it 's part of constantly trying to rediscover my youth .
i find a bit of that in cologne - and when i 'm writing , " she added . life writes the most intense dramas faye cukier has said that some of her experiences were not unlike those of anne frank , the german-born jewish girl who wrote her famous diary while her family was hiding in nazi-occupied amsterdam . she said that with the publication of her book this year in english , she hopes it will arouse interest among german publishers . sadly , one might otherwise be left to conclude that only holocaust victims and writers who died in concentration camps - like anne frank - or those who managed to survive them - like elie wiesel - merit publication . while on her current trip to cologne , however , cukier has begun giving readings in english and talks in german from her book , " fleeing the swastika . "
audiences there , at least , would like to be able to read her story in german - if publishers ever decide to print it . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bestselling german-jewish author satirizes the holocaust satirizing the holocaust has long been a taboo theme in germany .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .
now , it all depends on whether these things can find a meeting point and whether works in indian languages can be translated adequately and whether we can find a way of thinking about them and reading them . sonia phalnikar interviewed amit chaudhuri send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we greatly value our relationship with germany " indian commerce and industry minister kamal nath talked to dw-world.de about indo-german ties , protectionism in europe and chancellor merkel 's stance on nuclear energy .

his books , " freedom song , " and " a strange and sublime address , " among others , have received numerous international awards including the commonwealth writers prize and the los angeles times book prize . chaudhuri , who spent time at berlin ’ s free university in early 2006 as a visiting guest professor , will also be at the frankfurt book fair , which begins on oct . 3 and focuses on india . dw-world.de : how do you explain the growing interest in the west in indian writing in english ? amit chaudhuri : the first thing of course was the success of " midnight 's children " by salman rushdie in the early 1980s .
but i hesitate to think of that as a myth of origin mainly because it obscures the fact that there were so many extremely interesting writers in english preceding rushdie who were both poets , novelists or even short-story writers .
rushdie represents a kind of hallucinatory cliff behind which we can not see , almost like an obstruction we 've created - we can not see what was there before him .
there are continuities going back beyond rushdie , though rushdie is an interesting and forceful occurrence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie 's 1981 novel " midnight 's children " put india on the global literary map at the same time , the success of " midnight 's children " in the west also leads you to identify that particular sort of novel of a pan-indian nature , a grand historical narrative and a particular sort of magical realism and fantasy with the project of indian writing in english .
that is not true .
rushdie himself has admitted that it 's a much more heterogeneous project than that . i think that in the west the interest in indian writing in english has to do with the interest in the role of english in india and the role of india itself increasingly in the globalized world .
but the idea of linking literature to the economic fate of a nation is to miss precisely the ironical force of literature , that it has a separate prestige .
it seems to me that the west is not interested in that ironical relationship .
otherwise it would be more interested in the literature that india produced when it was a colonized country , which is an extremely interesting body of work , or even the literature produced in the indian languages , which is the literature of communities that are not directly linked to globalization . is n't india partly responsible for creating this image of being a rising economic superpower ? yes , it is n't just a western perception , but also india 's , particularly middle-class india 's perception of itself .
it 's linked to de-regularization and globalization and the idea that india can be a big player .
the dividing line between postcolonial pride and imperialistic ambition is very small for the middle class in india - one lapses into the other very easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india ' cities are increasingly home to an upwardly mobile middle class we have long entertained ambitions of being a regional superpower , once that was achieved , a world superpower economic or otherwise .
now we have our security council aspirations as well , and our diaspora does n't look particularly like people lost in exile but are contributing economically and to the idea of this growing prestige of india .
and indian writing in english reflects that and traverses that thin line between postcolonial pride and imperialist ambition .
i would be happy with a writing that is more ambiguous about its own position and wish it would be less triumphant .
i feel alienated from that personally as a writer . do you think indian writing has also suffered as a result of the country 's modernizing and globalizing zeal ? for me the position of the outsider is of great importance to the health of any society .
for any cultural practice , whether it 's academic or literary , the position of the outsider , the misfit , the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self-critical social and intellectual space .
they are important components because of the latent critique of power that they have in constituting our imaginative life . my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india , typically for a globalizing country , has n't theorized a position for the outsider or for the misfit or for failure .
its rhetoric is concerned with success in various ways .
so indian writing in english or any other phenomenon is always spoken in terms of success and if it is not successful , it becomes invisible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of chaudhuri 's " a new world " right now we do not have a space for the irresponsible misfit , which means we do not have a space which is at an angle to power .
even those who speak against power are in some ways in powerful positions of their own .
in india , everybody is some way in some kind of nexus of power .
we need to regain that space for the irresponsible . it 's sometimes forgotten , particularly in the west , that english is the language of only a small percentage of indians .
do you think the current popularity of the indian novel in english has come at the expense of writing in indian languages ? i would hesitate to say something as categorical as that .
for a number of reasons , the way we look at literature has changed .
vernacular writing -lrb- writing in indian languages -rrb- occupies a slightly different space .
obviously kannada literature -lrb- literature from the southern indian state of karnataka -rrb- can not and does n't want to speak on behalf of something called india or pretend to be indian literature .
only writing in english can bear that burden , have that pretension and ambition of representing the history and totality of a country .
that is for many people one of the interesting things about indian writing in english . but it also has its costs .
vernacular literature has suffered because of the monumental and visible aspirations of indian writing in english because writing in english gave indian writing this pan-indian ambition .
but indian writing in english has also suffered in its quality sometimes as well as in its ambition .
the ambition to create these pan-indian narratives can not be a long-term ambition for any literature .
there have to be other explorations .
but maybe that is already happening .
as indians who hail from small towns and other backgrounds within the urban milieu begin to write more , we begin to get fiction of a much greater heterogeneity . at the same time , we have to keep in mind the multilingual character of india .
indians have been multilingual since antiquity , but modern indians are multilingual in a new way and different sides of themselves are in business with one another and one ca n't ignore that .
one ca n't arrive at a proper understanding of what the indian literary sensibility or landscape might be without it . the frankfurt book fair , where india is the guest of honor , hopes to attract the attention of european publishers , particularly german publishers , to indian vernacular literature .
do you think translated works in indian languages can be accessible to german readers ? in germany , somehow there is greater interest in indian writing in regional languages .
so many writers who write in indian languages , who have not been translated into english , are translated into german .
that is an interesting and curious thing because german itself has its own form of regional identity , just to be part of europe is no longer in the globalized world a passport to being the representative of some sort of universal culture .
a universal culture or some sort of version of it is located entirely in the anglophone world in globalization .
i register in myself the surprise when i move about in germany here with white people not talking in english .
it brings home to me that regionalism does n't only have to do with india , but has to do with europe too . and here in germany , where the market has n't completely taken over , this regional culture allows certain sorts of experiments and a very liberating form of playing around with the arts .
this you do n't see in the anglophone world , where the market has taken over those domains in a more homogenizing way .
it 's that element of both being slightly neglected but also having the space for experimentation for freedom , which is what on one level art is and was about , that seems to be common to both authors writing in indian languages as well as german writers and makes both so exciting . and , paradoxically , much as it occupied a place at an angle to british power before independence , vernacular literature once again has been given its own space and freedom to pursue its own impulses in a globalized english-speaking india .
this leads to sometimes very interesting , surprising and delightful things being found in writing in the indian languages .
for instance , playing around with certain forms like the short story and the novella , which are non-commercial forms and are not pursued in the anglophone world because success is so much an important criterion in deciding what gets published .
you do find the same thing here in germany with writers , the same kind of regionalism at work .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair " bombay is a city of extremes " literature -pipe- 03.10.2006 indian writers in english open new chapter in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vikram chandra is among a new crop of indian writers who has won international acclaim as india takes center stage at the frankfurt book fair , it 's not the salman rushdies , arundhati roys and vikram seths , but a new generation of authors writing in english who are making waves . the last time india was guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , in 1986 , the buzz was about salman rushdie .
largely credited with putting india on the global literary map in 1981 with " midnight ’ s children , " rushdie was the undeniable star of the show . but now , as india steps up to bask in the spotlight at frankfurt again , the focus is on a new crop of writers in english . many have moved beyond the traditional anglophone market to enter european territory , as publishers from france , germany , spain , italy and the netherlands have trickled into india in recent years in search of the next literary sensation . " the empire writes back " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , german publishers in particular have been scrambling to buy indian rights and have undertaken a wave of translations . more than 25 translated works of fiction have emerged in the german market alone this year .
they include books by altaf tyrewala , samit basu , suketu mehta , vikram chandra , kiran nagarkar , thrity umrigar , shobha de and raj kamal jha . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor is both a diplomat and a writer “ indian writing in english has become a bit of a trend , ” said shashi tharoor , author and until recently , indian candidate for the post of the next un secretary general , speaking at a recent press conference in berlin .
tharoor , whose books “ show business ” and “ nehru : the invention of india ” were translated into german this year , compared the boom to the flowering of latin american writers in the 1970s and ' 80s .
“ in a way it ’ s like the empire writing back , ” he said . ulrike netenjakob of the munich-based karl blessing publishing company , which published british-born delhi-based author rana dasgupta 's acclaimed " tokyo cancelled " in german this year , said much of the current interest could be traced , not just to rushdie , but to arundhati roy 's booker-winning " the god of small things . " published in 1997 , it sold no less than four million copies by the end of that year and was translated into more than 25 languages , from french to finnish . " roy set a huge trend because she had that rare combination of being both a huge commercial and critical success internationally , ” netenjakob said .
" that helped to shed an altogether different light on indian literature . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arundhati roy broke all records with her " god of small things " in all fairness , writers such as rushdie , vs naipaul and vikram helped prepare the ground for roy ’ s phenomenal success .
but nobody was prepared for the stampede of literary agents and publishers from london and new york into india , signing up a string of writers who had barely begun work on their novels . " the flavor of the season ” the current european interest in india may not compare to the post-roy publishing frenzy , but there ’ s no denying that india is the “ flavor of the season , ” as nuzhat hassan , head of the delhi-based national book trust put it earlier this year . indeed , europe 's surge of interest in indian writing in english is also an acknowledgement of the country 's growing economic clout and its embrace of global capitalism - a fact that has also caused upheaval in its chaotic cities and social fabric . " few countries offer the kind of material that india has to offer .
we have a fractured past , a difficult present , which seeps into our writing , " tarun tejpal , author and editor of delhi-based weekly paper tehelka told reuters last year .
" it 's also a reflection of the increasing economic power of india .
culture rides on the coattails of economic efflorescence , " he said . tejpal 's " the alchemy of desire " sold 14,000 copies on the french market within a month of its release last year .
the story of a journalist who discovers a collection of diaries written by an american woman in an old colonial home in the himalayan foothills has also been translated into spanish , italian and german . indian writer namita gokhale , one of the participants at the frankfurt book fair , said it was hard to ignore india any longer . " india is a huge paradox - both unchanged and changing , modern yet rooted in tradition - and our literature has so much to say about this radical sense of change . " bombay beckons peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of african , asian and latin american literature , pointed out that recent indian works in english marked a strong departure from both its stereotypical image of oriental wisdom as well as the social critiques and rural themes spawned by writers such as mulk raj anand and r k narayan in the 1970s and ' 80s . " today we have novels that dwell on a ' shining india ' and vibrant cities like bombay and their problems .
that naturally appeals to a broader swathe of readers . " indeed , stories emanating from the 12-million strong city of bombay , or mumbai as it is known today , seem to have captured the imagination of german publishers . at least six authors whose works reflect a slice of the teeming city have been translated into german ahead of the book fair - altaf tyrewala 's slick debut " no god in sight , " vikram chandra 's epic crime thriller set in bombay 's underworld , " sacred games , " socialite shoba de 's " starry nights , " shashi tharoor 's ironic take on bollywood , " show business , " and thrity umrigar 's " the space between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala 's " no god in sight " has received rave reviews among them the not yet 30-year-old altaf tyrewala has become something of a darling of the german media .
his crisp , fast-paced seemingly unconnected narrative accounts of ordinary people in bombay , from a muslim abortionist , a shoe shop employee to a villager forced to leave the countryside and come to the city have received strong praise from german critics . jens mühling of berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper who travelled to bombay to meet tyrewala , a former software specialist who studied in the us , said the city had a magnetic pull on the west , despite its problems . " of course it 's dirty , stinking and crazily full , but it was still fascinating to search for the bombay that ’ s the subject of so many books and reconcile it with the real bombay , " said mühling .
" the city is just overflowing with stories . " some point out that though the book fair is a chance to shine light in dark corners of india ’ s literary landscape , the current crop of writing is just the tip of the iceberg . “ we 're still only at the threshold of a hugely exciting continent with a vibrant literary scene , " said michi strausfeld of the suhrkamp publishing company , one of germany ’ s largest which has translated a host of titles in the build-up to the book fair .
" writers definitely do much more than politicians and the media in helping outsiders understand their country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .

the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam .

but who was really at fault ? most danes were shocked by the hostility that flared up last year at caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed , which were first published by a danish newspaper .
muslim protesters attacked danish embassies and businesses in various countries - and some 50 people died in clashes between demonstrators and police .
now author per bech thomsen takes a look back at the origins of the conflict and the issues involved . " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned , " which hits danish bookstores on tuesday , features interviews with some of the principle figures , including denmark 's prime minister and the artist who made the most controversial drawing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : per bech thomsen author of " the mohammed crisis " in the book , kurt westergaard , who depicted mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , says he was making a political statement .
" the idea with my drawing was to illustrate that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from the fundamentalist part of islam , " westergaard is quoted as saying .
islam forbids any visual depictions of its main prophet . freedom of speech or media campaign ? in thomsen 's book , danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen says that , although some muslims found the drawings deeply offensive , the issue was one of freedom of expression .
" i am not a muslim and am not bound by the depiction ban , " rasmussen told thomsen .
" i must take note of the fact that there were many muslims who could take offense .
it does n't mean that we should give in to their points of view . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's prime minister appearing on arab-language tv but some danes say the caricatures , first published by the conservative jyllands posten newspaper , were only intended to stir up trouble .
" the newspaper presented this as being about the fight for free speech , " danish islamic studies expert jörgen baeck told dw-radio .
" that became problematic .
danish prime minister rasmussen picked up the theme and for months maintained that freedom of expression was the real issue .
so publishing these drawings can be seen as a conscious provocation . " thomsen said he hopes his book will stimulate further dialogue .
" i think both sides , christians as well as muslims , have learned something from this , " thomsen said on the eve of the book 's publication .
" when someone like me speaks to all the participants , whether editors , imams or journalists , the nuances become clearer and we get a better understanding of different points of view . " skepticism about dialogue in germany , too , many people hope that talking about differences will help resolve conflicts .

the debate over pope benedict xvi 's citation of a text critical of islam and the cancellation of a mozart opera in berlin because of fears of a muslim backlash are only the two latest examples that the tension described in thomsen 's book is still alive . some say the problem is with islam itself .
in an article for a mass-circulation newspaper this weekend , the secretary general of the governing christian democrats , ronald pofalla , wrote : " certainly it is painful for many muslims that their religion is misused for violence … but the problem of religiously motivated violence is today almost exclusively a problem of islam . " and some german muslims criticize europeans for failing to stick up for their secular values .
in an interview published on wednesday in the online version of the news magazine der spiegel , political scientist bassam tibi said : " muslims stand by their religion entirely .
it is a sort of religious absolutism .
while europeans have stopped defending the values of their civilization .
they confuse tolerance with relativism . " per bech thomsen 's " the mohammed crisis : what happened , what we have learned " reconstructs how a series of cartoons could have led to the spectacle of burning danish embassies .

" silicon saxony , " jena and leipzig are flourishing , but anklam and uckermark are becoming more and more desolate , continued the paper .
democratic defeatism " is not the result of a political genetic defect , but of the real and alleged experiences of many people in the east .
the west germans had the fortune of experiencing democracy parallel to the " economic miracle " in the 50s and 60s ; they experienced democracy as a form of government in which their lives improved .
thirty years later , many east germans experienced the opposite . " " only one-quarter of those in former east germany is content with the functioning of democracy .
in former west germany , it 's still one in two , " commented berlin 's daily tagesspiegel monday .
" and it should n't necessarily be the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- that teaches them they are capable of enforcing more seriousness and candor themselves .
practical political constraints require political courage and the capacity to act in a democracy .
they do n't require lies .
sixteen years after german unification might just be the right time to remember that . " the daily leipziger volkszeitung wrote in its monday edition , " germans have made progress with integration in the day-to-day things , " it wrote , pointing out that clichés like that of the ever complaining easterner or the westerner always knowing better have n't entirely disappeared yet , but they 've become out-dated and they 're used less frequently .
" now the ideological fights are more about whether it 's nicer to go on vacation to -lrb- the baltic sea islands of -rrb- rügen -lrb- which had been part of east germany -rrb- or föhr -lrb- which had been part of west germany -rrb- . " " appeals here , parties there .
these wo n't be lacking on unification day , " wrote the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung on monday .
" chancellor angela merkel has already made her message clear and called for greater willingness in the west for rebuilding in the east .
it might sound severe , but she 's not going to achieve it , " continued the paper .
" why should the citizens do more than big daddy state is already doing ?
for years , the state has been spending billions on pretty facades , which does n't really improve what 's behind them .
in any case , the willingness to pay is not going to increase .
considering the higher taxes everywhere , it 's more likely to decline .

a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula .
-lrb- 16.09.2006 -rrb- a win-win situation for american investors in east germany a central location , government subsidies , financial security and low wages make former east germany attractive to american investors .

production glitches have repeatedly forced airbus to push back delivery dates for the world 's largest commercial passenger aircraft . " cost overruns and late delivery payments will result in irrecoverable expenses and a corresponding 2.8 billion euro reduction in previously expected cumulative ebit -lrb- earnings before interest and tax before goodwill impairment and exceptional items -rrb- over the 2006 to 2010 peiod , " eads said in a statement . eads also unveiled a cost-cutting program , which it said it expected to save 2 billion euros a year by 2010 and said it would delay delivery of the a380 by an average of one more year .
the first plane is expected to be delivered to singapore airlines in october 2007 .
in 2008 , 13 a380s will reach their customers , said streiff .
the following year , 25 planes would be delivered . " only in 2010 will we reach production of four a380s per month , " he said .
workers worried the shock therapy program , nicknamed " power 08 , " could have unsettling implications for workers at airbus ' two main production facilities in toulouse , france , and hamburg , germany . ahead of the meeting , french newspapers had been speculating that the restructuring program would include concentrating the production of the a380 exclusively in toulouse while moving all construction of the a320 model to hamburg .
in addition , it was thought that subcontractors in countries such as russia and china would take over 30 percent of the production and the financial risks for the a350 model .
but no decision was made on tuesday to shift production , eads co-chief thomas enders told german news agency dpa . compromise led to inefficiency the a380 , the model which was supposed to be its prestige project , is the biggest headache for airbus - a cooperative project between france , germany , spain and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo christian streiff is in charge of restructuring to keep all the partners happy , the company 's former managers decided to split production between various countries .
but that decision led to major snags .

supply bottlenecks for the plane 's electrical system have meant that half-finished fuselages wait around in both the toulouse and hamburg plants for parts to arrive . the investment firm morgan stanley says it does not expect airbus ' a380 super-jumbo to generate any meaningful profits until after 2010 . german-french conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg went to considerable lengths to attract the a380 france 's economics minister , thierry breton , has come out in support of streiff and eads management , saying the restructuring would be " good for customers , employees and shareholders . "
but the changes could have dramatic effects for workers at airbus ' 17 european production facilities . in hamburg , 2,500 of airbus ' 12,000 employees were hired directly to work on the a380 .
if production of that model were transferred exclusively to france , they could find themselves out of a job . meanwhile , workers in toulouse fear losing the a320 model , which accounted for 80 to 90 percent of airbus ' orders in 2005 .
french unions are demanding that germany bear the brunt of the restructuring , arguing that airbus in france is already using foreign labor to meet 50 to 70 percent of its needs .
hamburg 's senator for economics , gunnar uldall , on the other hand , has dismissed the idea of transferring production of the a380 away from his city as " nonsense . " even if eads decides to forgo compulsory lay-offs , there will likely be less work at both facilities .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

3 , by moving the holiday to a sunday . the move was aimed at reducing the generous portion of german public holidays - up to 16 , depending on the state - and increasing the country 's economic output .
but the plan was swiftly abandoned after the opposition attacked it as " unpatriotic " and accused the government of " forgetting history . " while schröder 's plan may have backfired , it underlined the routine practicality with which germans have come to celebrate the anniversary of reunification - an event which proved so tumultuous and emotional when the berlin wall came down in 1989 . getting a day off from work , it seems , is much higher on the list of german priorities than remembering the country 's recent past .
in a recent poll , 68 percent of germans said the holiday was not a personal cause for celebration , while 80 percent said oct .
3 should remain a national holiday . " lack of enthusiasm for oct .
3 is understandable , " said historian and expert on modern germany konrad jarausch , who teaches at the university of north carolina and also serves as co-director of the center for research on contemporary history in potsdam .
" germans have been disappointed in celebrating occasions like the kaiser 's or hitler 's birthday and therefore have no tradition of a national holiday that transcends different regimes . " from nostalgia to disappointment some point out that the lack of enthusiasm for the anniversary of reunification has much to do with a deep sense of disillusionment at the failure to remedy the resulting economic imbalances in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people are nostalgic about gdr " germans , in general , are skeptical about national festivities , " said rainer münz , a senior fellow at the migration research group of the hamburg institute of world economics . " but there are also people , especially in western germany , who think that they would have been better off without the reunification because of its economic costs , which were significant .
some people are nostalgic about the gdr and would have preferred the gdr socialism with a human touch . " according to the latest report on german unity , which the german government publishes annually before oct .
3 , germany has invested more than 250 billion euros -lrb- $ 317 billion -rrb- in direct aid since 1990 in the so-called " new states " in former east germany .
a further 156 billion euros have been agreed upon for the period 2005-2019 as part of a comprehensive economic package known as " solidarity pact ii . " there 's little doubt that despite the lofty promises of transforming post-communist wastelands into " blooming landscapes , " made by chancellor helmut kohl in the spring of 1990 , the results of german reunification have been mixed at best . " those were clearly political promises , with no basis in economics , " münz said . not a vanilla sauce when the german government published its report on the state of unity this year , it had to acknowledge some tough issues ranging from rampant unemployment to negative demographics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cities in the east have been restored to their past glory " this is a realistic account and not some kind of vanilla sauce that is poured over problems , " said germany 's minister of transportation , building and urban development wolfgang tiefensee last week in berlin when presenting the report . problems are , indeed , hard to miss .
right-wing extremism is much more acute in eastern germany than it is in the west .
despite some economic successes and a revitalized infrastructure , eastern germany has still not caught up with the western part of the country : wages in the eastern regions are 23 percent lower and unemployment rates are nearly twice as high . " it will take 15 to 20 more years before we can speak about sustainable economic revival -lrb- in the eastern part -rrb- , " tiefensee said . how green is the grass ? experts point out that the population flight from eastern germany can only be stemmed by creating job opportunities in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup saw an explosion of german national pride " the problem is that the too rapid transformation from a planned to a market economy during unification , the too high conversion rate of the currency and the too generous wage settlements have destroyed much of the productive base in the east , " jarausch said .
" the challenge for the next half generation is therefore to create a new industrial base in the eastern states . " critics of reunification have often used negative demographics to paint a picture of the " new states " as particularly old and shriveling spots on the graying german horizon .
the federal office which advises the german government on urban planning has predicted that the overall german population will decrease by around half a percent by 2020 , but that the number of people living in the " new states " will sink by 7.7 percent for the same period , in some areas of the country even more . " these numbers actually sound optimistic to me , " münz said .
" there are cities in eastern germany - like görlitz and schwedt an der oder - that have lost up to 30 percent of their population . " not just a german problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital population fluctuation , however , is not a new phenomenon and by no means a specifically german predicament . " population shifts have always been part of german history , " jarausch said .
" nazi economic policy , the influx of postwar refugees and communist economic priorities created new population centers in the east , some of which are now dismantling themselves .
that is no doubt sad for the areas concerned -lrb- because it initiates a negative cycle -rrb- , but it does not affect the entire east equally , since some dynamic regions are actually growing . " much more important is the general german tendency to put personal life-style above having children , " he added .
" that is the real demographic challenge for the future . " sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , people continue to move west in search of a better life , but this move needs to be seen nowadays also in the context of global restructuring of world markets . " we should not blame these people who move out , " münz said .
" basically it 's a positive decision to move out and look for jobs . " he pointed out that much the same is happening in other areas of germany , such as the industrial ruhr region -lrb- in the west -rrb- , or in other parts of europe such as greek islands or central france , where population density is also decreasing . given the multitude of challenges still facing germany 16 years after reunification , some point out that state-sponsored celebrations on tuesday might not be a good idea .

south wales probation chief executive ian lankshear told bbc wales ' week in week out they could be safely managed in the community if better supervised .
judge patrick harrington qc said giving prison sentences to non-violent drug addicts was " utterly pointless " .
the home office said it had a commitment to providing tough community sentences as an alternative to jail .
prisons in cardiff , usk and swansea had only 13 free spaces left in august , according to home office figures .
the privately-run parc prison in bridgend is already eight over its operational capacity limit .
the jail was built for 830 inmates , but now routinely houses more than 1,000 .
the prison population in england and wales is now almost 80,000 . "
a sentence of four months imprisonment on a drug addict is utterly pointless - it achieves nothing whatsoever " patrick harrington qc mr lankshear told week in week out : " at least a third of the people serving sentences in custody could be safely managed in the community if we had the supervision capacity .
" with the amount of overcrowding that there can be in some establishments , the chances of doing anything meaningful with people - in terms of engaging with the reasons why they commit offences - those chances are reduced , and you end up warehousing people . "
the probation service and others in the criminal justice system are particularly concerned about the number of people in prison for non-violent drug offences .
the prison reform trust told the programme that the average cost of housing a prisoner was £ 37,000 pa , but probation and drugs rehabilitation services argued this money could be better spent .
mr harrington , a part-time judge said : " a sentence of four months imprisonment on a drug addict is utterly pointless , it achieves nothing whatsoever - but the judge has his options reduced . "
mr harrington said judges were driven to a position where " a custodial sentence becomes the inevitable " .
he said more thought needed to go into the alternatives which would rid people of addiction to drugs .
magistrate jo jenkins , who sits on the home office 's independent monitoring board , said the prison system was so full that many rehabilitation programmes could not be delivered .
" the numbers are going to go up inexorably , " she said .
" we are going to be holding people in swansea police station , for instance , or police cells across south wales .
" they are certainly not going to receive any better assistance with their re-offending problems there .
unless somebody finds a solution to this then i think society really is going to be the poorer for it . "
a home office spokesman said : " we will always ensure that there will be prison places for those serious , sexual and prolific offenders who ought to be in prison .
" we are also aware that there are people in prison who ought not to be there , including those with mental health issues and vulnerable women .
" we have outlined our commitment to provide custodial places for those who need to be in prison and to ensure that courts have tough community sentences at their disposal to deal with less serious , non violent offenders . "

scans on seven overweight people revealed the regions of the brain that controlled satiety were the same as those in drug addicts craving drugs .
the us team who carried out the research said the findings could potentially help to uncover new treatments for obesity .
the work , led by a new york scientist , is published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . "
it gives us another channel to understand how to treat or prevent obesity " dr gene-jack wang the researchers looked at brain impulses in seven overweight individuals .
they had all been previously fitted with a weight-reduction device called an implantable gastric stimulator -lrb- igs -rrb- .
the implant sends electronic signals to the vagus nerve which then relays messages of satiety to the brain , thus reducing the desire to eat .
to study the interaction between the stomach and the brain , the volunteers received two brain scans spaced two weeks apart , one when the implant was turned on and the other while it was switched off .
new channels while the volunteers were feeling full and the implant was turned on , the scan revealed an increased metabolism in the hippocampus , an area of the brain associated with emotional behaviour , learning and memory , the orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum .
lead researcher dr gene-jack wang , at the brookhaven national laboratory , new york , said : " as soon as we saw these scans , immediately it reminded me of what we had studied in drug abuse when people were under a craving situation - the same areas in the brain lit up . "
he said this supported the idea that there were commonalities in the brain circuitry that underlay food intake and compulsive drug intake .
although the study was small , he added , it would help to further understand the desire to eat and obesity .
" it gives us another channel to understand how to treat or prevent obesity . "
professor jimmy bell , of the molecular imaging group at hammersmith hospital , said : " this is a very interesting paper .
" there is a lot of research going on around the world looking for biomarkers - anything that will tell you directly what is going on in a biological process - to understand the relationship between appetite , satiety and emotional factors that control what we eat , and when we eat and how much we eat .
" i do not think it is surprising they have found a link between drug addiction and overeating .

lead researcher dr gene-jack wang , at the brookhaven national laboratory , new york , said : " as soon as we saw these scans , immediately it reminded me of what we had studied in drug abuse when people were under a craving situation - the same areas in the brain lit up . "
he said this supported the idea that there were commonalities in the brain circuitry that underlay food intake and compulsive drug intake .

professor jimmy bell , of the molecular imaging group at hammersmith hospital , said : " this is a very interesting paper .
" there is a lot of research going on around the world looking for biomarkers - anything that will tell you directly what is going on in a biological process - to understand the relationship between appetite , satiety and emotional factors that control what we eat , and when we eat and how much we eat .

scans on seven overweight people revealed the regions of the brain that controlled satiety were the same as those in drug addicts craving drugs .
the us team who carried out the research said the findings could potentially help to uncover new treatments for obesity .
the work , led by a new york scientist , is published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
it gives us another channel to understand how to treat or prevent obesity dr gene-jack wang the researchers looked at brain impulses in seven overweight individuals .
they had all been previously fitted with a weight-reduction device called an implantable gastric stimulator -lrb- igs -rrb- .
the implant sends electronic signals to the vagus nerve which then relays messages of satiety to the brain , thus reducing the desire to eat .
to study the interaction between the stomach and the brain , the volunteers received two brain scans spaced two weeks apart , one when the implant was turned on and the other while it was switched off .

the animals were born on bardsey island off the llyn peninsula and should have been shipped to the mainland in august in time for the winter .
but a combination of bad weather and transport problems mean they are stuck on bardsey , which is 1.5 miles -lrb- 2.5km -rrb- long and half a mile -lrb- 1km -rrb- across .
farmers david and libby barnden said they are at their wits ' ends coping with their extended flock .
" we 've had 700 lambs effectively marooned here by various problems one of which is obviously the weather , " said mr barnden .
" that 's an awful lot of sheep for a 440 acre lump of rock especially when the weather is starting to deteriorate , we 're getting well into the autumn now . "
there 's a limited amount of grazing here and that really is all required for the ewes " david barnden libby barnden , who is being helped by sheepdog lass , added : " it 's just so frustrating because there 's no end in sight , we 've spent all our time chasing the sheep around trying to keep them in - it 's just a disaster . "
the stranded sheep were born on the island earlier this year and which should have been shipped off the island in august .
" yeah , it 's been one of those years , definitely been one of those years , " admitted mr barnden .
" you know , there have been problems with the boat when they 've been resolved then the weather 's decided to throw its hat into the ring . "
the weather around the island is notorious - even in the calm months of the summer there can be days at a time when the boats can not make the three mile journey .
such a large number of animals simply can not survive on the island over the winter , said mr barnden .
" once the weather really begins to turn nasty , the salt starts to burn the grass off .
" there 's a limited amount of grazing here and that really is all required for the ewes .
there 's no spare , there 's no option to leave them here all winter . "
coupled with that , the young ram lambs are already maturing but strict breeding regulations mean they must be kept well away from the ewes .
" i 've lost a lot of sleep over the last few weeks i do n't mind admitting , " he said , adding they were kept busy stopping the animals escaping .
" it 's difficult going to bed every night and waking up the next morning , remembering where you were for day after day and then that runs into weeks - frustrating to put it mildly .
his wife added : " the weather could keep blowing for weeks and weeks and weeks and then well , dave 's been tearing his hair out . "
monday 's good weather meant a boat capable of transporting the sheep has now arrived on bardsey .
but with more strong winds forecast , the barndens said their problems were still far from over .

at the end of microsoft 's xbox event last week , the lights dimmed and the screen filled with the recognisable characters and crafts from the halo games .
with a third game in the series under development you will have been forgiven for thinking this was a new trailer for the fans to digest .
but the studio name at the start of the short film was ensemble and not bungie , and it quickly became clear this was a new addition to the halo universe .
halo wars is a real-time strategy -lrb- rts -rrb- title being developed for the xbox 360 and its unveiling followed lord of the rings director peter jackson 's announcement that he is developing a new form of interactive entertainment based around the halo games .
coupled with a movie based on halo , ongoing novels , a graphic novel and the third core halo title , it 's clear microsoft is keen to cash in on one of the most popular franchises in the games industry .
but is it a sign that bungie , the developers of halo , are letting go of their precious creation ?
brian jarrard , community manager at bungie , said : " it is a precious franchise and that has n't changed .
halo and halo 2 have sold more than 13m copies worldwide " we can only do so much as bungie .
it 's microsoft 's ip -lrb- intellectual property -rrb- .
" halo has been extremely popular , it 's a valuable franchise for xbox . "
claude errera , who runs the popular fansite halo.bungie.org , said reader reaction to the new game had been mixed .
" there is of course the group that resists all change and thinks that bungie is selling out .
" but equally there are those who feel bungie can do no wrong but are afraid the company will have no involvement in the game , and those who are adopting a wait and see approach . "
mr jarrard said it made sense for ensemble to make a halo rts .
" halo started as an rts .
would the bungie team love to do one themselves ?
possibly .
" we are not focused on that .
we 've got a lot of work to do on halo 3 and a trilogy to finish . "
the people who are interested in expanding the franchise who work at bungie want to do so because they have a lot of stories to tell claude errera , halo fansite editor he added : " when it came down to having awesome partners that are the best in the business at what they do you do n't feel so bad about sharing the baby at that point .
" i do n't think we would have been supportive of these projects if we did n't feel they would bring something new to halo and add value to franchise .
" we are excited on both fronts . "
mr errera said there were many more stories left to tell in the halo universe .
" the people who are interested in expanding the franchise who work at bungie want to do so because they have a lot of stories to tell .
" the games are going to run out at some point .
they have already said that halo 3 is the end of this particular story arc .
halo wars is being developed by ensemble studios " the entire team has been working on halo games since 1998 and they are probably tired of it .
but there are still stories to tell . "
but even if the halo rts fails , the movie bombs at the box office and peter jackson 's new form of interactive entertainment turns out to be suspiciously like the old dragon 's lair game of the 1980s , the core fans will forgive all , if halo 3 turns out to be a success .
for the hard-core fans , the new spin-offs are little more than a distraction as they wait to hear more details about halo 3 .
and halo fans are a patient bunch - few details escape from bungie before launch .
" community has always been super important to bungie - it 's sort of at our roots , " said mr jarrard .
" we have this mantra of under-promise , over-deliver .
we are perfectionists .
" we should have some more information about multiplayer soon ; a screenshot or two .
" when things get a little quiet we stoke the coals a little bit . "
expect microsoft to stoke the fires like a furnace when the game is released next year .
with playstation 3 finally on shop shelves in november and available worldwide by next march , halo 3 will be microsoft 's less than secret weapon .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- halo universe expands as fans wait bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 3 october 2006 , 07:50 gmt 08:50 uk halo universe expands as fans wait the announcement of a new videogame spin-off from the popular halo franchise has fans buzzing but the developers of a third title in the series remain tight-lipped .
at the end of microsoft 's xbox event last week , the lights dimmed and the screen filled with the recognisable characters and crafts from the halo games .
with a third game in the series under development you will have been forgiven for thinking this was a new trailer for the fans to digest .
but the studio name at the start of the short film was ensemble and not bungie , and it quickly became clear this was a new addition to the halo universe .
halo wars is a real-time strategy -lrb- rts -rrb- title being developed for the xbox 360 and its unveiling followed lord of the rings director peter jackson 's announcement that he is developing a new form of interactive entertainment based around the halo games .
coupled with a movie based on halo , ongoing novels , a graphic novel and the third core halo title , it 's clear microsoft is keen to cash in on one of the most popular franchises in the games industry .
but is it a sign that bungie , the developers of halo , are letting go of their precious creation ?
brian jarrard , community manager at bungie , said : " it is a precious franchise and that has n't changed .
" we can only do so much as bungie .
it 's microsoft 's ip -lrb- intellectual property -rrb- .
" halo has been extremely popular , it 's a valuable franchise for xbox . "
claude errera , who runs the popular fansite halo.bungie.org , said reader reaction to the new game had been mixed .
" there is of course the group that resists all change and thinks that bungie is selling out .
" but equally there are those who feel bungie can do no wrong but are afraid the company will have no involvement in the game , and those who are adopting a wait and see approach . "
mr jarrard said it made sense for ensemble to make a halo rts .
" halo started as an rts .
would the bungie team love to do one themselves ?
possibly .
" we are not focused on that .
we 've got a lot of work to do on halo 3 and a trilogy to finish . "
" the people who are interested in expanding the franchise who work at bungie want to do so because they have a lot of stories to tell " claude errera , halo fansite editor he added : " when it came down to having awesome partners that are the best in the business at what they do you do n't feel so bad about sharing the baby at that point .
" i do n't think we would have been supportive of these projects if we did n't feel they would bring something new to halo and add value to franchise .

but doctors who are at the front-line of the debate are struggling to come down on either side .
the images of the " walking " feotus were published two years ago two years ago images showing a 12-week-old foetus sucking their thumb and appearing to " walk " were published .
ever since , a debate about the upper limit of abortion has raged .
during last year 's general election it hit the headlines when the then tory leader michael howard said he would back moves to reduce the 24-week limit .
this year cardinal cormac murphy o 'connor has met health secretary patricia hewitt urging her to reduce the upper limit .
and mps have got in on the act too with 130 mps - including science and technology committee chairman phil willis - have backed a motion calling for a review of the law .
the government has , to date , remained steadfast on the issue saying it is not on the agenda .
abroad the health secretary has even come out to say she is not in favour of lowering the limit despite france , germany and italy all setting an upper limit between 12 and 13 weeks .
the 24-week limit was set in 1990 as an amendment to the 1967 abortion act .
yes , i work in this field , but that does not make me any more qualified to judge what should be done dr huseyin mehmet , of imperial college london while the 3d moving images may have been the catalyst which ignited the debate , leading doctors do not believe they provide the intellectual evidence behind the need for one .
instead , they say the key has been the advances in medical technology which mean doctors are able to keep babies alive even when they are born before 24 weeks gestation .
however , despite the progress over the last decade , doctors still have mixed views over the right way forward .
the abortion limit was debated at the british medical association 's annual conference last year for the first time since 1989 , but despite many arguing for the limit to be lowered , delegates voted against such a move .
leading doctors , speaking at a briefing organised by the science media centre in london , all said it would be wrong to assume the images proved that foetuses at such a young age were conscious and sentient beings .
abortion time limits france : 12 weeks germany : 12 weeks italy : 13 weeks sweden : 18 weeks us : limits after 26 weeks australia : no limit dr donald peebles , a consultant in foetal medicine at university college london , said the " fantastic " images provided a view of what goes on in the womb that was " completely comprehensible " to the public .
but in scientific terms , they contributed nothing new to the debate over whether the legal time limit for abortion should be lowered from 24 weeks .
he said : " the temptation is to associate foetal movements with adult movements - it 's sucking its thumb because it 's happy , it 's walking because it 's going somewhere .

but doctors who are at the front-line of the debate are struggling to come down on either side .
the images of the " walking " feotus were published two years ago two years ago images showing a 12-week-old foetus sucking their thumb and appearing to " walk " were published .
ever since , a debate about the upper limit of abortion has raged .
during last year 's general election it hit the headlines when the then tory leader michael howard said he would back moves to reduce the 24-week limit .
this year cardinal cormac murphy o 'connor has met health secretary patricia hewitt urging her to reduce the upper limit .
and mps have got in on the act too with 130 mps - including science and technology committee chairman phil willis - have backed a motion calling for a review of the law .
the government has , to date , remained steadfast on the issue saying it is not on the agenda .
abroad the health secretary has even come out to say she is not in favour of lowering the limit despite france , germany and italy all setting an upper limit between 12 and 13 weeks .
the 24-week limit was set in 1990 as an amendment to the 1967 abortion act .
yes , i work in this field , but that does not make me any more qualified to judge what should be done dr huseyin mehmet , of imperial college london while the 3d moving images may have been the catalyst which ignited the debate , leading doctors do not believe they provide the intellectual evidence behind the need for one .
instead , they say the key has been the advances in medical technology which mean doctors are able to keep babies alive even when they are born before 24 weeks gestation .
however , despite the progress over the last decade , doctors still have mixed views over the right way forward .
the abortion limit was debated at the british medical association 's annual conference last year for the first time since 1989 , but despite many arguing for the limit to be lowered , delegates voted against such a move .
leading doctors , speaking at a briefing organised by the science media centre in london , all said it would be wrong to assume the images proved that foetuses at such a young age were conscious and sentient beings .
abortion time limits france : 12 weeks germany : 12 weeks italy : 13 weeks sweden : 18 weeks us : limits after 26 weeks australia : no limit dr donald peebles , a consultant in foetal medicine at university college london , said the " fantastic " images provided a view of what goes on in the womb that was " completely comprehensible " to the public .
but in scientific terms , they contributed nothing new to the debate over whether the legal time limit for abortion should be lowered from 24 weeks .
he said : " the temptation is to associate foetal movements with adult movements - it 's sucking its thumb because it 's happy , it 's walking because it 's going somewhere .
i think it 's that step that 's incredibly dangerous . "

directed by nicholas hytner , the film opens in the uk on 13 october .

the actor attributed the success of the play - which won six tony awards earlier this year - to the fact that it is " never boring " .

" a bit later on you realise that you are in a situation where you understand these people and you know what they are feeling . "
since opening at the national theatre in london in 2004 , the original cast have recreated their roles in hong kong , new zealand , new york 's broadway and on film .
" the ability to trust your fellows is enormously powerful and important on screen and on stage , " said griffiths .

lobby group global witness say a $ 900m deal to mine iron ore allows mittal to opt out of human rights and environmental laws and is inequitable .
liberia is trying to recover from 14 years of conflict , which left the country in ruins .
the contract is being reviewed by liberia 's new , elected government .
global witness calls the deal a missed opportunity for liberia .
mittal declined to comment on the report .
strong position bbc developing world correspondent david loyn says liberia 's economy will undoubtedly be strengthened and the contract will provide jobs .
but global witness say the contract means mittal will be unaccountable to the democratic government and not give it high enough returns .
mittal is planning to almost double in size in the next 25 years and half of the ore needed for that expansion is set to come from liberia .
global witness director patrick alley told the bbc 's network africa programme that this put liberia in a strong position to negotiate a better deal .
under the contract , mittal will be able to opt out of liberian laws governing human rights or environmental standards and they will pay no tax for five years , in a deal which appears to be renewable by them .
when they do finally pay tax , it will be at a price set by them .
" there is no guarantee for the liberian government of how much money they will actually receive , " mr alley said .
the deal was signed last year by liberia 's interim power-sharing government , set up to end the long civil war .
president ellen johnson-sirleaf , who took office in january , has said she will review all contracts signed by the interim government .
global witness says the first round of negotiations in september were inconclusive and are set to resume later this month .

the problem , however , is making them listen .
" she told me she sees over eight clients a day , seven days a week , " writes the " field reporter " on a prostitute review website .
" she hates men : ' they abuse me ' .
sounds to me like she 's trafficked . "
whether the punter was sufficiently concerned to call police following his exit from the windsor brothel is unclear .
but it is likely that his suspicions are correct - ministers say thousands of foreign women have been brought to the uk to work in its sex industry .
it led to tuesday 's launch by police of the uk human trafficking centre -lrb- ukhtc -rrb- , a unit charged with tackling the problem .
among the men it hopes to reach are not only those who visit prostitutes alone , but the growing number of young men who end an evening of beer and banter with a trip to a brothel together .
startlingly ordinary greater awareness of trafficking follows two decades in which the demand for sex workers has , according to ukhtc officers , " increased dramatically " .
human trafficking human trafficking - movement of people for ' slavery ' most cases in uk involve sexually exploited women victims have been found in every part of the uk majority of uk victims from eastern europe and asia around world more than 100 countries involved in trafficking guide : human trafficking ' i was trafficked at 15 ' many of the women meeting this demand come from overseas .
a study by anti-trafficking charity the poppy project found that about 80 % of prostitutes in london were foreign .
the proportion in other towns and cities is also high .
among them , in every part of the uk , are trafficking victims .
the typical man who uses prostitutes is startlingly ordinary .
he is : " around 30 years of age , married , in full time employment , and with no criminal convictions , " the home office suggests . "
this girl is clearly not independent .
the agency owners are obviously trafficking over these girls to work in the paid sex industry for their own greed " website ' review ' - kingston nor are they as few and far between as many people would expect .
a study published in the journal sexually transmitted infections in 2005 suggested that one in 10 british men used prostitutes .
divorce rates , sex tourism , stag weekends , lads ' mags and the ubiquity of internet pornography have all been blamed .
" what we 're seeing more and more now is young men going out in groups , treating a trip to a brothel as a social event - just as if they are going to the pub , " the ukhtc 's deputy chief constable grahame maxwell has said .
it is this " laddish " group that mr maxwell sees as the priority for educating about links between prostitution and trafficking .
the aim is to " put it into people 's minds that if you are paying for sex , you may be paying for sex with a trafficked woman " .
rights and wrongs efforts to alert men to the plight of trafficked women side-step arguments about the rights and wrongs of prostitution , to concentrate on the victims . "
there is a reassuring glimpse of iron in her personality - reassuring because of the rumours that she might be trafficked " website ' review ' - kingston awareness campaigns have emphasised their status as unwilling participants and men have been reminded of how they would feel if it were happening to their own sister , girlfriend or daughter .
the crimestoppers number has been promoted - including on prostitute ' review ' websites - to encourage men to contact police if they believe a woman has been trafficked .
there is some anecdotal evidence that punters are responding positively - with postings on their message boards suggesting they are more aware of the issues , police say .
in a number of cases , women have been rescued with the help of clients .
" we have had referrals where women have actively sought help and been assisted -lrb- to escape -rrb- by a punter , " says natalia dawkins , manager of the poppy project .
but these cases are still the exception - the majority of punters remain either unaware of the extent of the problem , or indifferent to it .
some enjoy the women 's plight , police say .
' human nature ' claims that men may not be aware when a woman is trafficked are rejected by ms dawkins who says " human nature " would quickly make it apparent .
" men who buy sex are aware when women are trafficked or not there of their own choice .
it would have been obvious . "
not only is there likely to be some distress on the victim 's part , but there are other clues - like being offered an italian woman , but finding an albanian who speaks no english .
other clues might be that the price quoted is lower than normal , or unprotected sex is offered , says mr maxwell .
' wider implications ' one area in which there have been calls for greater action is in prosecuting men who have sex with trafficked women .
so far there have only been a handful of arrests .
a problem is that in ordinary rape cases evidence gathering , from the woman and the scene , is comparatively straightforward .
in the case of a trafficking victim " they 're being raped 30 times a day and probably , after a certain time , do n't want to think about what 's happening to them , " says mr maxwell .
the way forward , he says , is for police to prosecute traffickers while increasing awareness among men of trafficking .
" we want it to be a topic of conversation , " he says , adding that men need to realise that " slavery still exists " .
