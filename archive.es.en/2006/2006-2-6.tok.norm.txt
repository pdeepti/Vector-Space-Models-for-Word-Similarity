" i am horrified to see the way violence and attacks are spreading throughout the middle east , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told reporters hours after lebanese demonstrators set fire to its embassy there in clashes that left at least 28 people injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim cleric looks on as the danish mission in beirut burns " the actions in lebanon and syria yesterday are beyond comprehension and totally unacceptable , " he said . the attacks " can by no means be legitimized and are utterly unacceptable , " said austria , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency . " violence is unacceptable " the spiraling row also found mention at the annual munich security conference over the weekend , with german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticizing the violence . merkel said she understood that the mohammed cartoons had hurt the religious sentiments of muslims , but said the violent anti-danish reactions to the cartoons were unacceptable . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was following developments with increasing concern and appealed to " all rational forces to counter the false prophet of the culture clash . " speaking at a meeting in the eastern german city of dresden along with the presidents of finland , italy , latvia , austria , portugal and hungary , german president horst köhler said the events were unacceptable . " violence and threats are not acceptable under any circumstances , " köhler said . escalating controversy the controversy , first sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed in danish newspaper jyllands-posten last september , has escalated ever since media in norway , france , germany , italy , spain and several other mostly european countries have reproduced some or all the dozen caricatures . muslims and their governments have called the images blasphemous and contrary to islamic tradition prohibiting depictions of mohammed .
one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .
there were no reports of danish casualties in any of the incidents . the first fatalities in over a week of protests were reported in afghanistan on monday .
three afghans were killed at a rally in the eastern city of mihtarlam when police fired on demonstrators after a police station came under attack . afghanistan has seen huge demonstrations over the past few days with thousands of people taking to the streets in protest .
hundreds of muslims protested in kandahar and mazar-e-sharif , while 200 demonstrators gathered outside the danish embassy in the capital , kabul . in protests in the north-eastern province of takhar , demonstrators threw stones at government buildings and police fired in the air . in somalia , a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after protesters attacked the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor waves an islamic flag in front of the burning danish mission in beirut in beirut on sunday , thousands of protesters rampaged through the christian area of ashrafiyeh , throwing stones , breaking windows and overturning cars .
they defied police firing tear gas to storm the danish embassy building using ladders .
there they hacked at walls and windows with axes and poles and set the place ablaze , sending thick smoke billowing into the sky . denmark 's red-and-white flag was set alight . anger was vivid in the palestinian territories , too .
in the west bank city of nablus , 20 palestinian gunmen stormed the french cultural center and spray-painted a cross over its front door with a slogan reading : " closed until your country apologizes . " similar action was taken against the german cultural center in gaza city on saturday and against eu offices last week . muslim leaders appeal for calm leading figures in the muslim world are now stepping in to call for calm and restraint . afghan president hamid karzai urged muslims worldwide to remain peaceful , and added that muslims should be above violence and not stoop to the same level as those who published the cartoons .
karzai said that the prophet mohammed was much too exalted to be insulted by mere cartoons . the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , a group of 57 muslim countries , agreed to a meeting with danish foreign minister per stig moeller over the row .
the oic also criticized the attacks on scandinavian embassies and said it condemned these " regrettable " incidents . it added that the reactions were " overblown " and " dangerous and hindered efforts to defend the just causes of the muslim world .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .

it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .
due to the fact that many european countries are home to fast-growing and often poorly integrated muslim minorities , discord like that which is bubbling over now could threaten the long-term peace in their societies . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons leading politicians have sharply criticized the escalating violence in the arab world over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed , even as muslim leaders are now calling for calm and restraint .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .

while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .

not just to promote the sporting event , but also to protect the interests of the world cup partners and sponsors . when germany and costa rica walk onto the pitch for the opening match of the 2006 world cup , it will not be in munich 's allianz arena .
no , the sell-out crowd of 66,000 screaming and fanatical spectators will be sitting -lrb- and standing -rrb- in the " world cup stadium - munich . " it 's a somewhat unbecoming moniker for what is certainly germany 's most impressive soccer arena , but rules are rules when it comes to company names .
the insurance giant allianz is not a fifa partner , and hence , will not profit even indirectly from the tournament .
the name will either have to taken down or covered during the tournament . fifa has signed agreements worth over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- with 15 international partners -lrb- 42 million euros each -rrb- and six national sponsors -lrb- 12 million each -rrb- .
the likes of continental , hyundai , coca-cola and mcdonald 's paid big bucks for exclusivity , and the body will do its best to ensure that nobody will crash the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa head sepp blatter says he has an obligation to cup sponsors when it comes to corporate presence in and around the stadiums , " a time to make money " could well replace the cup 's slogan , " a time to make friends . "
the defensive wall of the world soccer body is meant to be impenetrable and to extend beyond the ticket gates at the venues . " we are obligated towards our partners , " commented fifa president joseph blatter . when is enough enough ? the fact that hamburg 's aol arena will lose its name for the month-long tournament is acceptable to most people .
but attempts to prohibit the appearance of non-sponsor logos and advertising within a kilometer of the stadium may be stretching it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa and its sponsors hope for a joyful 2006 world cup " in a legal sense , it is not possible to have an advertising ban around the stadiums , " lawyer hermann schlindwein from frankfurt told the publication horizont sport business . fifa begs to differ .
the body does n't claim a strict physical ban is automatic , but stipulations in the agreements signed with the stadiums reveal there must be tight controls . " in the leases , it has been clearly determined that the rented sites must be clean -lrb- of third-party -rrb- advertising when they are handed over , " gregor lentze , managing director of fifa marketing and tv germany , told horizont sport business . at the confederation cup last summer , bank names on atm 's within a kilometer were covered up .
journalists were even asked to put tape over the names of their computer laptops and microphones . 420 violations - four months before the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will have to remove the aol tag from its stadium the world soccer body is particularly sensitive about the use of terms like " wm 2006 " - wm being the german abbreviation for world cup - " soccer wm germany , " " world cup 2006 , " or " soccer hamburg 2006 . "
fifa patented some 100 variations to prevent copycat entrepreneurs from profiting .
already four months before the first goal has been scored , some 420 copyright and patent violations , 300 alone in germany , have been prosecuted , most to the advantage of fifa . fifa 's aggressive preventative tactics serve a purpose , namely scaring away people , cities and companies from even entering the gray zone of world cup advertising .
there will be time for everyone to make friends , and perhaps even money , but not too close to the stadiums . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash .
-lrb- may 13 , 2005 -rrb- ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts .
-lrb- april 11 , 2005 -rrb- alright everyone , let 's see those world cup smiles the winter months in germany give little reason to smile .
but by the time the summer and world cup rolls around , that should change : a three million euro friendliness campaign wants to guarantee it .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt .

the defense keeps leaking but the goals keep coming in bayern munich 's chief rival 's pursuit of the runaway leaders . werder bremen conceded a goal after just 14 seconds but then produced the comeback of the season to stay within eight points of leaders bayern munich with a 4-2 win over mainz 05 on saturday . bremen looked to be heading for their fourth defeat of the season after conceding twice in the first 13 minutes .
the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace .

the defense keeps leaking but the goals keep coming in bayern munich 's chief rival 's pursuit of the runaway leaders . werder bremen conceded a goal after just 14 seconds but then produced the comeback of the season to stay within eight points of leaders bayern munich with a 4-2 win over mainz 05 on saturday . bremen looked to be heading for their fourth defeat of the season after conceding twice in the first 13 minutes .
the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace . " we were watching our opponents and deserved to go 2-0 down , " confessed bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" fortunately we got back into things at the end of the second half and fought back after the awful start . " super-fast strike rattles zidan 's paymasters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz loan star zidan opened the scoring against his owner club egyptian international zidan , on loan at mainz from bremen , was the focal point heading into the bremen-mainz clash at the weserstadion and the striker took just 14 seconds to make bremen regret allowing him to take part in the fixture . " he did not know if he was allowed to celebrate , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . zidan took advantage of some woeful defending to fire the fastest goal of the season and niclas weiland added another on 13 minutes to leave bremen staring defeat in the face . former bayern munich striker giovanni elber and ex-bayer leverkusen striker ulf kirsten hold the record for the fastest ever bundesliga goal at 11 seconds .
elber set the record in 1998 and kirsten equaled the mark in 2002 . but bremen average 2.5 goals a game in the bundesliga and produced an amazing comeback with valdez pulling a goal back on 39 minutes before frenchman johan micoud and croatian international ivan klasnic scored two more in first half stoppage time . valdez added another to show their prowess in front of goal but italian champions juventus , their last 16 champions league opponents on february 22 , will have noted the defensive flaws with interest .

" we were lucky not to go behind but when we scored it gave us the confidence to control the game , " said bayern manager felix magath . despite the win , magath indicated there was more to come from bayern - if the condition of the pitch improved .
" the uneven pitch is the reason why we can not play better at home , " he added . former leverkusen favorite michael ballack , who helped the club reach the 2002 champions league final , scored the vital goal on 36 minutes chesting the ball before dispatching a brilliant volley into the net . it was bayern 's 16th win in 19th games and continued a remarkable run for munich goalkeeper oliver kahn who has not tasted defeat in a home match against bayer for 16 games . hamburg recover to keep title hopes alive third-placed sv hamburg remain a point behind werder bremen and they also needed to come from behind to secure the spoils in a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergei barbarez completed the comeback with the winner hamburg , the only german team to beat bayern this season , stayed in touch with bremen despite falling behind to an isaac boakye goal which put visitors arminia ahead on 26 minutes .
six minutes into the second half and hamburg were level through piotr trochowski and the comeback was completed when bosnian international sergei barbarez scored the winner with 73 minutes on the clock . elsewhere the biggest game of the day was the 127th ruhr derby between schalke 04 and borussia dortmund but the two arch rivals could not be separated in a scoreless draw which made more headlines for the crowd trouble before the game than the match itself . schalke lose ground on hamburg , now six points ahead , in the race for the three champions league spots , while dortmund miss the chance to close on fifth-placed hertha berlin who occupy the final uefa cup spot . gladbach 's european hopes dented by resurgent wolves on sunday , a revived borussia mönchengladbach had their hopes of playing in europe next season dented when they were beaten 2-0 away to vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke stole the show in wolfsburg win with a goal and an assist wolfsburg took the lead at the end of the first half with an emphatic finish from diego klimowicz and german international mike hanke grabbed the second in the 64th minute . gladbach , who could have gone up to fifth with a win , drop to eighth place with 25 points after a second successive bundesliga defeat . new wolfsburg coach klaus augenthaler 's home debut showed a marked improvement in overall quality , the lack of which precipitated the departure of holger fach in the mid-season break . hanke makes case for inclusine in world cup squad and it was also good news for germany coach jürgen klinsmann who was handed a happy world cup selection headache by hanke 's outstanding performance in the second striker 's role .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .

" we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .

the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .
" solving the iranian nuclear issue is the key task for the immediate future unless we want an arms race in the middle east , " steinmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , rumsfeld urge world to act on iran threat german chancellor angela merkel and us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged the world to prevent the islamic republic from developing a nuclear weapon .

" i am horrified to see the way violence and attacks are spreading throughout the middle east , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told reporters hours after lebanese demonstrators set fire to its embassy there in clashes that left at least 28 people injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim cleric looks on as the danish mission in beirut burns " the actions in lebanon and syria yesterday are beyond comprehension and totally unacceptable , " he said . the attacks " can by no means be legitimized and are utterly unacceptable , " said austria , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency . " violence is unacceptable " the spiraling row also found mention at the annual munich security conference over the weekend , with german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticizing the violence . merkel said she understood that the mohammed cartoons had hurt the religious sentiments of muslims , but said the violent anti-danish reactions to the cartoons were unacceptable . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was following developments with increasing concern and appealed to " all rational forces to counter the false prophet of the culture clash . " speaking at a meeting in the eastern german city of dresden along with the presidents of finland , italy , latvia , austria , portugal and hungary , german president horst köhler said the events were unacceptable . " violence and threats are not acceptable under any circumstances , " köhler said . escalating controversy the controversy , first sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed in danish newspaper jyllands-posten last september , has escalated ever since media in norway , france , germany , italy , spain and several other mostly european countries have reproduced some or all the dozen caricatures . muslims and their governments have called the images blasphemous and contrary to islamic tradition prohibiting depictions of mohammed .
one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .
there were no reports of danish casualties in any of the incidents . the first fatalities in over a week of protests were reported in afghanistan on monday .
three afghans were killed at a rally in the eastern city of mihtarlam when police fired on demonstrators after a police station came under attack . afghanistan has seen huge demonstrations over the past few days with thousands of people taking to the streets in protest .
hundreds of muslims protested in kandahar and mazar-e-sharif , while 200 demonstrators gathered outside the danish embassy in the capital , kabul . in protests in the north-eastern province of takhar , demonstrators threw stones at government buildings and police fired in the air . in somalia , a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after protesters attacked the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor waves an islamic flag in front of the burning danish mission in beirut in beirut on sunday , thousands of protesters rampaged through the christian area of ashrafiyeh , throwing stones , breaking windows and overturning cars .
they defied police firing tear gas to storm the danish embassy building using ladders .
there they hacked at walls and windows with axes and poles and set the place ablaze , sending thick smoke billowing into the sky . denmark 's red-and-white flag was set alight . anger was vivid in the palestinian territories , too .
in the west bank city of nablus , 20 palestinian gunmen stormed the french cultural center and spray-painted a cross over its front door with a slogan reading : " closed until your country apologizes . " similar action was taken against the german cultural center in gaza city on saturday and against eu offices last week . muslim leaders appeal for calm leading figures in the muslim world are now stepping in to call for calm and restraint . afghan president hamid karzai urged muslims worldwide to remain peaceful , and added that muslims should be above violence and not stoop to the same level as those who published the cartoons .
karzai said that the prophet mohammed was much too exalted to be insulted by mere cartoons . the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , a group of 57 muslim countries , agreed to a meeting with danish foreign minister per stig moeller over the row .
the oic also criticized the attacks on scandinavian embassies and said it condemned these " regrettable " incidents . it added that the reactions were " overblown " and " dangerous and hindered efforts to defend the just causes of the muslim world .

one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .
there were no reports of danish casualties in any of the incidents . the first fatalities in over a week of protests were reported in afghanistan on monday .
three afghans were killed at a rally in the eastern city of mihtarlam when police fired on demonstrators after a police station came under attack . afghanistan has seen huge demonstrations over the past few days with thousands of people taking to the streets in protest .
hundreds of muslims protested in kandahar and mazar-e-sharif , while 200 demonstrators gathered outside the danish embassy in the capital , kabul . in protests in the north-eastern province of takhar , demonstrators threw stones at government buildings and police fired in the air . in somalia , a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after protesters attacked the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor waves an islamic flag in front of the burning danish mission in beirut in beirut on sunday , thousands of protesters rampaged through the christian area of ashrafiyeh , throwing stones , breaking windows and overturning cars .
they defied police firing tear gas to storm the danish embassy building using ladders .
there they hacked at walls and windows with axes and poles and set the place ablaze , sending thick smoke billowing into the sky . denmark 's red-and-white flag was set alight . anger was vivid in the palestinian territories , too .
in the west bank city of nablus , 20 palestinian gunmen stormed the french cultural center and spray-painted a cross over its front door with a slogan reading : " closed until your country apologizes . " similar action was taken against the german cultural center in gaza city on saturday and against eu offices last week . muslim leaders appeal for calm leading figures in the muslim world are now stepping in to call for calm and restraint . afghan president hamid karzai urged muslims worldwide to remain peaceful , and added that muslims should be above violence and not stoop to the same level as those who published the cartoons .
karzai said that the prophet mohammed was much too exalted to be insulted by mere cartoons . the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , a group of 57 muslim countries , agreed to a meeting with danish foreign minister per stig moeller over the row .
the oic also criticized the attacks on scandinavian embassies and said it condemned these " regrettable " incidents . it added that the reactions were " overblown " and " dangerous and hindered efforts to defend the just causes of the muslim world .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

the defense keeps leaking but the goals keep coming in bayern munich 's chief rival 's pursuit of the runaway leaders . werder bremen conceded a goal after just 14 seconds but then produced the comeback of the season to stay within eight points of leaders bayern munich with a 4-2 win over mainz 05 on saturday . bremen looked to be heading for their fourth defeat of the season after conceding twice in the first 13 minutes .
the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace . " we were watching our opponents and deserved to go 2-0 down , " confessed bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" fortunately we got back into things at the end of the second half and fought back after the awful start .

" he did not know if he was allowed to celebrate , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . zidan took advantage of some woeful defending to fire the fastest goal of the season and niclas weiland added another on 13 minutes to leave bremen staring defeat in the face . former bayern munich striker giovanni elber and ex-bayer leverkusen striker ulf kirsten hold the record for the fastest ever bundesliga goal at 11 seconds .
elber set the record in 1998 and kirsten equaled the mark in 2002 . but bremen average 2.5 goals a game in the bundesliga and produced an amazing comeback with valdez pulling a goal back on 39 minutes before frenchman johan micoud and croatian international ivan klasnic scored two more in first half stoppage time . valdez added another to show their prowess in front of goal but italian champions juventus , their last 16 champions league opponents on february 22 , will have noted the defensive flaws with interest .

" we were lucky not to go behind but when we scored it gave us the confidence to control the game , " said bayern manager felix magath . despite the win , magath indicated there was more to come from bayern - if the condition of the pitch improved .
" the uneven pitch is the reason why we can not play better at home , " he added . former leverkusen favorite michael ballack , who helped the club reach the 2002 champions league final , scored the vital goal on 36 minutes chesting the ball before dispatching a brilliant volley into the net . it was bayern 's 16th win in 19th games and continued a remarkable run for munich goalkeeper oliver kahn who has not tasted defeat in a home match against bayer for 16 games . hamburg recover to keep title hopes alive third-placed sv hamburg remain a point behind werder bremen and they also needed to come from behind to secure the spoils in a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergei barbarez completed the comeback with the winner hamburg , the only german team to beat bayern this season , stayed in touch with bremen despite falling behind to an isaac boakye goal which put visitors arminia ahead on 26 minutes .
six minutes into the second half and hamburg were level through piotr trochowski and the comeback was completed when bosnian international sergei barbarez scored the winner with 73 minutes on the clock . elsewhere the biggest game of the day was the 127th ruhr derby between schalke 04 and borussia dortmund but the two arch rivals could not be separated in a scoreless draw which made more headlines for the crowd trouble before the game than the match itself . schalke lose ground on hamburg , now six points ahead , in the race for the three champions league spots , while dortmund miss the chance to close on fifth-placed hertha berlin who occupy the final uefa cup spot . gladbach 's european hopes dented by resurgent wolves on sunday , a revived borussia mönchengladbach had their hopes of playing in europe next season dented when they were beaten 2-0 away to vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke stole the show in wolfsburg win with a goal and an assist wolfsburg took the lead at the end of the first half with an emphatic finish from diego klimowicz and german international mike hanke grabbed the second in the 64th minute . gladbach , who could have gone up to fifth with a win , drop to eighth place with 25 points after a second successive bundesliga defeat . new wolfsburg coach klaus augenthaler 's home debut showed a marked improvement in overall quality , the lack of which precipitated the departure of holger fach in the mid-season break . hanke makes case for inclusine in world cup squad and it was also good news for germany coach jürgen klinsmann who was handed a happy world cup selection headache by hanke 's outstanding performance in the second striker 's role .

about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .

in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage .

about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .
ver.di says this amounts to a salary cut of 4 percent . the union wants to force the regional authorities to implement public-service wage accords that were due to take effect in oct .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .

the insurance giant allianz is not a fifa partner , and hence , will not profit even indirectly from the tournament .
the name will either have to taken down or covered during the tournament . fifa has signed agreements worth over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- with 15 international partners -lrb- 42 million euros each -rrb- and six national sponsors -lrb- 12 million each -rrb- .
the likes of continental , hyundai , coca-cola and mcdonald 's paid big bucks for exclusivity , and the body will do its best to ensure that nobody will crash the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa head sepp blatter says he has an obligation to cup sponsors when it comes to corporate presence in and around the stadiums , " a time to make money " could well replace the cup 's slogan , " a time to make friends . "
the defensive wall of the world soccer body is meant to be impenetrable and to extend beyond the ticket gates at the venues . " we are obligated towards our partners , " commented fifa president joseph blatter . when is enough enough ? the fact that hamburg 's aol arena will lose its name for the month-long tournament is acceptable to most people .
but attempts to prohibit the appearance of non-sponsor logos and advertising within a kilometer of the stadium may be stretching it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa and its sponsors hope for a joyful 2006 world cup " in a legal sense , it is not possible to have an advertising ban around the stadiums , " lawyer hermann schlindwein from frankfurt told the publication horizont sport business . fifa begs to differ .
the body does n't claim a strict physical ban is automatic , but stipulations in the agreements signed with the stadiums reveal there must be tight controls . " in the leases , it has been clearly determined that the rented sites must be clean -lrb- of third-party -rrb- advertising when they are handed over , " gregor lentze , managing director of fifa marketing and tv germany , told horizont sport business . at the confederation cup last summer , bank names on atm 's within a kilometer were covered up .
journalists were even asked to put tape over the names of their computer laptops and microphones . 420 violations - four months before the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will have to remove the aol tag from its stadium the world soccer body is particularly sensitive about the use of terms like " wm 2006 " - wm being the german abbreviation for world cup - " soccer wm germany , " " world cup 2006 , " or " soccer hamburg 2006 . "
fifa patented some 100 variations to prevent copycat entrepreneurs from profiting .
already four months before the first goal has been scored , some 420 copyright and patent violations , 300 alone in germany , have been prosecuted , most to the advantage of fifa . fifa 's aggressive preventative tactics serve a purpose , namely scaring away people , cities and companies from even entering the gray zone of world cup advertising .
there will be time for everyone to make friends , and perhaps even money , but not too close to the stadiums . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash .
-lrb- may 13 , 2005 -rrb- ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts .
-lrb- april 11 , 2005 -rrb- alright everyone , let 's see those world cup smiles the winter months in germany give little reason to smile .
but by the time the summer and world cup rolls around , that should change : a three million euro friendliness campaign wants to guarantee it .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 06.02.2006 do n't mess with fifa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadium 's name was covered in the interests of world cup sponsors from june 9 to july 9 , the 12 host cities of the world cup will firmly be in the grip of fifa .
not just to promote the sporting event , but also to protect the interests of the world cup partners and sponsors . when germany and costa rica walk onto the pitch for the opening match of the 2006 world cup , it will not be in munich 's allianz arena .
no , the sell-out crowd of 66,000 screaming and fanatical spectators will be sitting -lrb- and standing -rrb- in the " world cup stadium - munich . " it 's a somewhat unbecoming moniker for what is certainly germany 's most impressive soccer arena , but rules are rules when it comes to company names .
the insurance giant allianz is not a fifa partner , and hence , will not profit even indirectly from the tournament .
the name will either have to taken down or covered during the tournament . fifa has signed agreements worth over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 840 million -rrb- with 15 international partners -lrb- 42 million euros each -rrb- and six national sponsors -lrb- 12 million each -rrb- .
the likes of continental , hyundai , coca-cola and mcdonald 's paid big bucks for exclusivity , and the body will do its best to ensure that nobody will crash the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa head sepp blatter says he has an obligation to cup sponsors when it comes to corporate presence in and around the stadiums , " a time to make money " could well replace the cup 's slogan , " a time to make friends . "
the defensive wall of the world soccer body is meant to be impenetrable and to extend beyond the ticket gates at the venues . " we are obligated towards our partners , " commented fifa president joseph blatter . when is enough enough ? the fact that hamburg 's aol arena will lose its name for the month-long tournament is acceptable to most people .
but attempts to prohibit the appearance of non-sponsor logos and advertising within a kilometer of the stadium may be stretching it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa and its sponsors hope for a joyful 2006 world cup " in a legal sense , it is not possible to have an advertising ban around the stadiums , " lawyer hermann schlindwein from frankfurt told the publication horizont sport business . fifa begs to differ .
the body does n't claim a strict physical ban is automatic , but stipulations in the agreements signed with the stadiums reveal there must be tight controls . " in the leases , it has been clearly determined that the rented sites must be clean -lrb- of third-party -rrb- advertising when they are handed over , " gregor lentze , managing director of fifa marketing and tv germany , told horizont sport business . at the confederation cup last summer , bank names on atm 's within a kilometer were covered up .
journalists were even asked to put tape over the names of their computer laptops and microphones . 420 violations - four months before the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will have to remove the aol tag from its stadium the world soccer body is particularly sensitive about the use of terms like " wm 2006 " - wm being the german abbreviation for world cup - " soccer wm germany , " " world cup 2006 , " or " soccer hamburg 2006 . "

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .

while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .

she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .

she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 06.02.2006 opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests show the importance of communication between the west and the islamic world the conflict raging over the caricatures of the prophet mohammed shows no sign of abating .
since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .
due to the fact that many european countries are home to fast-growing and often poorly integrated muslim minorities , discord like that which is bubbling over now could threaten the long-term peace in their societies . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons leading politicians have sharply criticized the escalating violence in the arab world over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed , even as muslim leaders are now calling for calm and restraint .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .
" solving the iranian nuclear issue is the key task for the immediate future unless we want an arms race in the middle east , " steinmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , rumsfeld urge world to act on iran threat german chancellor angela merkel and us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged the world to prevent the islamic republic from developing a nuclear weapon .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .

thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .

while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .

while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .

a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .

it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

it is the first widespread public-sector strike in 14 years and threatens to grow larger . hospitals , pre-schools and administration offices were affected , and trash was not collected , according to the service industry trade union ver.di.
about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .
ver.di says this amounts to a salary cut of 4 percent . the union wants to force the regional authorities to implement public-service wage accords that were due to take effect in oct .
2005 .
in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution .

it is the first widespread public-sector strike in 14 years and threatens to grow larger . hospitals , pre-schools and administration offices were affected , and trash was not collected , according to the service industry trade union ver.di.
about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .

in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage . " on the one hand germany has five million unemployed and on the other the employers want to prolong the working week for those newly employed , " ver.di chief frank bsirske said , arguing that this would increase unemployment further .

" i am horrified to see the way violence and attacks are spreading throughout the middle east , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told reporters hours after lebanese demonstrators set fire to its embassy there in clashes that left at least 28 people injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim cleric looks on as the danish mission in beirut burns " the actions in lebanon and syria yesterday are beyond comprehension and totally unacceptable , " he said . the attacks " can by no means be legitimized and are utterly unacceptable , " said austria , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency . " violence is unacceptable " the spiraling row also found mention at the annual munich security conference over the weekend , with german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticizing the violence . merkel said she understood that the mohammed cartoons had hurt the religious sentiments of muslims , but said the violent anti-danish reactions to the cartoons were unacceptable . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was following developments with increasing concern and appealed to " all rational forces to counter the false prophet of the culture clash . " speaking at a meeting in the eastern german city of dresden along with the presidents of finland , italy , latvia , austria , portugal and hungary , german president horst köhler said the events were unacceptable . " violence and threats are not acceptable under any circumstances , " köhler said . escalating controversy the controversy , first sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed in danish newspaper jyllands-posten last september , has escalated ever since media in norway , france , germany , italy , spain and several other mostly european countries have reproduced some or all the dozen caricatures . muslims and their governments have called the images blasphemous and contrary to islamic tradition prohibiting depictions of mohammed .
one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .
there were no reports of danish casualties in any of the incidents . the first fatalities in over a week of protests were reported in afghanistan on monday .
three afghans were killed at a rally in the eastern city of mihtarlam when police fired on demonstrators after a police station came under attack . afghanistan has seen huge demonstrations over the past few days with thousands of people taking to the streets in protest .
hundreds of muslims protested in kandahar and mazar-e-sharif , while 200 demonstrators gathered outside the danish embassy in the capital , kabul . in protests in the north-eastern province of takhar , demonstrators threw stones at government buildings and police fired in the air . in somalia , a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after protesters attacked the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor waves an islamic flag in front of the burning danish mission in beirut in beirut on sunday , thousands of protesters rampaged through the christian area of ashrafiyeh , throwing stones , breaking windows and overturning cars .
they defied police firing tear gas to storm the danish embassy building using ladders .
there they hacked at walls and windows with axes and poles and set the place ablaze , sending thick smoke billowing into the sky . denmark 's red-and-white flag was set alight . anger was vivid in the palestinian territories , too .
in the west bank city of nablus , 20 palestinian gunmen stormed the french cultural center and spray-painted a cross over its front door with a slogan reading : " closed until your country apologizes . " similar action was taken against the german cultural center in gaza city on saturday and against eu offices last week . muslim leaders appeal for calm leading figures in the muslim world are now stepping in to call for calm and restraint . afghan president hamid karzai urged muslims worldwide to remain peaceful , and added that muslims should be above violence and not stoop to the same level as those who published the cartoons .
karzai said that the prophet mohammed was much too exalted to be insulted by mere cartoons . the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , a group of 57 muslim countries , agreed to a meeting with danish foreign minister per stig moeller over the row .
the oic also criticized the attacks on scandinavian embassies and said it condemned these " regrettable " incidents . it added that the reactions were " overblown " and " dangerous and hindered efforts to defend the just causes of the muslim world .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .

she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .

" i am horrified to see the way violence and attacks are spreading throughout the middle east , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told reporters hours after lebanese demonstrators set fire to its embassy there in clashes that left at least 28 people injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim cleric looks on as the danish mission in beirut burns " the actions in lebanon and syria yesterday are beyond comprehension and totally unacceptable , " he said . the attacks " can by no means be legitimized and are utterly unacceptable , " said austria , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency . " violence is unacceptable " the spiraling row also found mention at the annual munich security conference over the weekend , with german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticizing the violence . merkel said she understood that the mohammed cartoons had hurt the religious sentiments of muslims , but said the violent anti-danish reactions to the cartoons were unacceptable . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was following developments with increasing concern and appealed to " all rational forces to counter the false prophet of the culture clash . " speaking at a meeting in the eastern german city of dresden along with the presidents of finland , italy , latvia , austria , portugal and hungary , german president horst köhler said the events were unacceptable . " violence and threats are not acceptable under any circumstances , " köhler said . escalating controversy the controversy , first sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed in danish newspaper jyllands-posten last september , has escalated ever since media in norway , france , germany , italy , spain and several other mostly european countries have reproduced some or all the dozen caricatures . muslims and their governments have called the images blasphemous and contrary to islamic tradition prohibiting depictions of mohammed .
one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .
there were no reports of danish casualties in any of the incidents . the first fatalities in over a week of protests were reported in afghanistan on monday .
three afghans were killed at a rally in the eastern city of mihtarlam when police fired on demonstrators after a police station came under attack . afghanistan has seen huge demonstrations over the past few days with thousands of people taking to the streets in protest .
hundreds of muslims protested in kandahar and mazar-e-sharif , while 200 demonstrators gathered outside the danish embassy in the capital , kabul . in protests in the north-eastern province of takhar , demonstrators threw stones at government buildings and police fired in the air . in somalia , a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after protesters attacked the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor waves an islamic flag in front of the burning danish mission in beirut in beirut on sunday , thousands of protesters rampaged through the christian area of ashrafiyeh , throwing stones , breaking windows and overturning cars .
they defied police firing tear gas to storm the danish embassy building using ladders .
there they hacked at walls and windows with axes and poles and set the place ablaze , sending thick smoke billowing into the sky . denmark 's red-and-white flag was set alight . anger was vivid in the palestinian territories , too .
in the west bank city of nablus , 20 palestinian gunmen stormed the french cultural center and spray-painted a cross over its front door with a slogan reading : " closed until your country apologizes . " similar action was taken against the german cultural center in gaza city on saturday and against eu offices last week . muslim leaders appeal for calm leading figures in the muslim world are now stepping in to call for calm and restraint . afghan president hamid karzai urged muslims worldwide to remain peaceful , and added that muslims should be above violence and not stoop to the same level as those who published the cartoons .
karzai said that the prophet mohammed was much too exalted to be insulted by mere cartoons . the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , a group of 57 muslim countries , agreed to a meeting with danish foreign minister per stig moeller over the row .
the oic also criticized the attacks on scandinavian embassies and said it condemned these " regrettable " incidents . it added that the reactions were " overblown " and " dangerous and hindered efforts to defend the just causes of the muslim world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.02.2006 bremen throw caution to the wind in pursuit of bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keep ' em coming : klasnic and co. are banging the goals in as bremen chase bayern " score more than you concede " seems to be werder bremen 's over-riding philosophy this season .
the defense keeps leaking but the goals keep coming in bayern munich 's chief rival 's pursuit of the runaway leaders . werder bremen conceded a goal after just 14 seconds but then produced the comeback of the season to stay within eight points of leaders bayern munich with a 4-2 win over mainz 05 on saturday . bremen looked to be heading for their fourth defeat of the season after conceding twice in the first 13 minutes .
the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace . " we were watching our opponents and deserved to go 2-0 down , " confessed bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" fortunately we got back into things at the end of the second half and fought back after the awful start . " super-fast strike rattles zidan 's paymasters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz loan star zidan opened the scoring against his owner club egyptian international zidan , on loan at mainz from bremen , was the focal point heading into the bremen-mainz clash at the weserstadion and the striker took just 14 seconds to make bremen regret allowing him to take part in the fixture . " he did not know if he was allowed to celebrate , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . zidan took advantage of some woeful defending to fire the fastest goal of the season and niclas weiland added another on 13 minutes to leave bremen staring defeat in the face . former bayern munich striker giovanni elber and ex-bayer leverkusen striker ulf kirsten hold the record for the fastest ever bundesliga goal at 11 seconds .
elber set the record in 1998 and kirsten equaled the mark in 2002 . but bremen average 2.5 goals a game in the bundesliga and produced an amazing comeback with valdez pulling a goal back on 39 minutes before frenchman johan micoud and croatian international ivan klasnic scored two more in first half stoppage time . valdez added another to show their prowess in front of goal but italian champions juventus , their last 16 champions league opponents on february 22 , will have noted the defensive flaws with interest . " we could have gone 3-0 up but bremen kept streaming forward and in the end they deserved to win , " said mainz chief jürgen klopp . bayern grind out another win to make it 16 out of 19 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack never lets sentimentality affect him when playing his former club bayern munich could have gone 11 points clear at the summit had bremen stumbled but had to settle for a ninth successive home victory with bayer leverkusen the latest victims in a 1-0 reverse . in contrast to the maverick approach of the bremen defense , bayern look rock solid at the back and that was underlined once again on saturday . " we were lucky not to go behind but when we scored it gave us the confidence to control the game , " said bayern manager felix magath . despite the win , magath indicated there was more to come from bayern - if the condition of the pitch improved .
" the uneven pitch is the reason why we can not play better at home , " he added . former leverkusen favorite michael ballack , who helped the club reach the 2002 champions league final , scored the vital goal on 36 minutes chesting the ball before dispatching a brilliant volley into the net . it was bayern 's 16th win in 19th games and continued a remarkable run for munich goalkeeper oliver kahn who has not tasted defeat in a home match against bayer for 16 games . hamburg recover to keep title hopes alive third-placed sv hamburg remain a point behind werder bremen and they also needed to come from behind to secure the spoils in a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergei barbarez completed the comeback with the winner hamburg , the only german team to beat bayern this season , stayed in touch with bremen despite falling behind to an isaac boakye goal which put visitors arminia ahead on 26 minutes .
six minutes into the second half and hamburg were level through piotr trochowski and the comeback was completed when bosnian international sergei barbarez scored the winner with 73 minutes on the clock . elsewhere the biggest game of the day was the 127th ruhr derby between schalke 04 and borussia dortmund but the two arch rivals could not be separated in a scoreless draw which made more headlines for the crowd trouble before the game than the match itself . schalke lose ground on hamburg , now six points ahead , in the race for the three champions league spots , while dortmund miss the chance to close on fifth-placed hertha berlin who occupy the final uefa cup spot . gladbach 's european hopes dented by resurgent wolves on sunday , a revived borussia mönchengladbach had their hopes of playing in europe next season dented when they were beaten 2-0 away to vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke stole the show in wolfsburg win with a goal and an assist wolfsburg took the lead at the end of the first half with an emphatic finish from diego klimowicz and german international mike hanke grabbed the second in the 64th minute . gladbach , who could have gone up to fifth with a win , drop to eighth place with 25 points after a second successive bundesliga defeat . new wolfsburg coach klaus augenthaler 's home debut showed a marked improvement in overall quality , the lack of which precipitated the departure of holger fach in the mid-season break . hanke makes case for inclusine in world cup squad and it was also good news for germany coach jürgen klinsmann who was handed a happy world cup selection headache by hanke 's outstanding performance in the second striker 's role .
the former schalke striker made a convincing case for inclusion by setting up klimowicz for a series of chances and showing great technique to score the clinching second " hanke was great again , " augenthaler said .
" he has one great target in front of him - to play in a world cup on home soil .

it is the first widespread public-sector strike in 14 years and threatens to grow larger . hospitals , pre-schools and administration offices were affected , and trash was not collected , according to the service industry trade union ver.di.
about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .
ver.di says this amounts to a salary cut of 4 percent . the union wants to force the regional authorities to implement public-service wage accords that were due to take effect in oct .
2005 .
in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage . " on the one hand germany has five million unemployed and on the other the employers want to prolong the working week for those newly employed , " ver.di chief frank bsirske said , arguing that this would increase unemployment further .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di chief frank bsirske in a radio interview over the weekend , bsirske said the union would not be dictated to by employers and accused them of trying to entrench longer working hours across the whole economy . could spread last week civil servants in the northern state of lower saxony went on strike against the measures and staged protest marches . ver.di members subsequently voted by a large majority on extending the strike and bsirske has warned that it could spread throughout the country .
workers in other states - bavaria , lower saxony , schleswig-holstein , saarland and saxony - are set to vote this week whether to stage stoppages as early as next monday . bavarian premier edmund stoiber told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that germany 's public administration could no longer afford a 38.5-hour week . " the coffers are empty , " he said .
" there 's no room to maneuver . " the german public-service sector has some 4.7 million workers , of whom 1.7 million are considered fully fledged civil servants . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin doctors demand better wages medical workers at europe 's largest university hospital started a week-long strike in berlin on monday , with more strikes being planned for december all over germany .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .
" solving the iranian nuclear issue is the key task for the immediate future unless we want an arms race in the middle east , " steinmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , rumsfeld urge world to act on iran threat german chancellor angela merkel and us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged the world to prevent the islamic republic from developing a nuclear weapon .

the defense keeps leaking but the goals keep coming in bayern munich 's chief rival 's pursuit of the runaway leaders . werder bremen conceded a goal after just 14 seconds but then produced the comeback of the season to stay within eight points of leaders bayern munich with a 4-2 win over mainz 05 on saturday . bremen looked to be heading for their fourth defeat of the season after conceding twice in the first 13 minutes .
the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace . " we were watching our opponents and deserved to go 2-0 down , " confessed bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" fortunately we got back into things at the end of the second half and fought back after the awful start . " super-fast strike rattles zidan 's paymasters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz loan star zidan opened the scoring against his owner club egyptian international zidan , on loan at mainz from bremen , was the focal point heading into the bremen-mainz clash at the weserstadion and the striker took just 14 seconds to make bremen regret allowing him to take part in the fixture . " he did not know if he was allowed to celebrate , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . zidan took advantage of some woeful defending to fire the fastest goal of the season and niclas weiland added another on 13 minutes to leave bremen staring defeat in the face . former bayern munich striker giovanni elber and ex-bayer leverkusen striker ulf kirsten hold the record for the fastest ever bundesliga goal at 11 seconds .
elber set the record in 1998 and kirsten equaled the mark in 2002 . but bremen average 2.5 goals a game in the bundesliga and produced an amazing comeback with valdez pulling a goal back on 39 minutes before frenchman johan micoud and croatian international ivan klasnic scored two more in first half stoppage time . valdez added another to show their prowess in front of goal but italian champions juventus , their last 16 champions league opponents on february 22 , will have noted the defensive flaws with interest .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

the defense keeps leaking but the goals keep coming in bayern munich 's chief rival 's pursuit of the runaway leaders . werder bremen conceded a goal after just 14 seconds but then produced the comeback of the season to stay within eight points of leaders bayern munich with a 4-2 win over mainz 05 on saturday . bremen looked to be heading for their fourth defeat of the season after conceding twice in the first 13 minutes .
the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace . " we were watching our opponents and deserved to go 2-0 down , " confessed bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" fortunately we got back into things at the end of the second half and fought back after the awful start . " super-fast strike rattles zidan 's paymasters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz loan star zidan opened the scoring against his owner club egyptian international zidan , on loan at mainz from bremen , was the focal point heading into the bremen-mainz clash at the weserstadion and the striker took just 14 seconds to make bremen regret allowing him to take part in the fixture . " he did not know if he was allowed to celebrate , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . zidan took advantage of some woeful defending to fire the fastest goal of the season and niclas weiland added another on 13 minutes to leave bremen staring defeat in the face . former bayern munich striker giovanni elber and ex-bayer leverkusen striker ulf kirsten hold the record for the fastest ever bundesliga goal at 11 seconds .
elber set the record in 1998 and kirsten equaled the mark in 2002 . but bremen average 2.5 goals a game in the bundesliga and produced an amazing comeback with valdez pulling a goal back on 39 minutes before frenchman johan micoud and croatian international ivan klasnic scored two more in first half stoppage time . valdez added another to show their prowess in front of goal but italian champions juventus , their last 16 champions league opponents on february 22 , will have noted the defensive flaws with interest . " we could have gone 3-0 up but bremen kept streaming forward and in the end they deserved to win , " said mainz chief jürgen klopp . bayern grind out another win to make it 16 out of 19 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack never lets sentimentality affect him when playing his former club bayern munich could have gone 11 points clear at the summit had bremen stumbled but had to settle for a ninth successive home victory with bayer leverkusen the latest victims in a 1-0 reverse . in contrast to the maverick approach of the bremen defense , bayern look rock solid at the back and that was underlined once again on saturday . " we were lucky not to go behind but when we scored it gave us the confidence to control the game , " said bayern manager felix magath . despite the win , magath indicated there was more to come from bayern - if the condition of the pitch improved .
" the uneven pitch is the reason why we can not play better at home , " he added . former leverkusen favorite michael ballack , who helped the club reach the 2002 champions league final , scored the vital goal on 36 minutes chesting the ball before dispatching a brilliant volley into the net . it was bayern 's 16th win in 19th games and continued a remarkable run for munich goalkeeper oliver kahn who has not tasted defeat in a home match against bayer for 16 games . hamburg recover to keep title hopes alive third-placed sv hamburg remain a point behind werder bremen and they also needed to come from behind to secure the spoils in a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergei barbarez completed the comeback with the winner hamburg , the only german team to beat bayern this season , stayed in touch with bremen despite falling behind to an isaac boakye goal which put visitors arminia ahead on 26 minutes .
six minutes into the second half and hamburg were level through piotr trochowski and the comeback was completed when bosnian international sergei barbarez scored the winner with 73 minutes on the clock . elsewhere the biggest game of the day was the 127th ruhr derby between schalke 04 and borussia dortmund but the two arch rivals could not be separated in a scoreless draw which made more headlines for the crowd trouble before the game than the match itself . schalke lose ground on hamburg , now six points ahead , in the race for the three champions league spots , while dortmund miss the chance to close on fifth-placed hertha berlin who occupy the final uefa cup spot . gladbach 's european hopes dented by resurgent wolves on sunday , a revived borussia mönchengladbach had their hopes of playing in europe next season dented when they were beaten 2-0 away to vfl wolfsburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke stole the show in wolfsburg win with a goal and an assist wolfsburg took the lead at the end of the first half with an emphatic finish from diego klimowicz and german international mike hanke grabbed the second in the 64th minute . gladbach , who could have gone up to fifth with a win , drop to eighth place with 25 points after a second successive bundesliga defeat . new wolfsburg coach klaus augenthaler 's home debut showed a marked improvement in overall quality , the lack of which precipitated the departure of holger fach in the mid-season break . hanke makes case for inclusine in world cup squad and it was also good news for germany coach jürgen klinsmann who was handed a happy world cup selection headache by hanke 's outstanding performance in the second striker 's role .
the former schalke striker made a convincing case for inclusion by setting up klimowicz for a series of chances and showing great technique to score the clinching second " hanke was great again , " augenthaler said .
" he has one great target in front of him - to play in a world cup on home soil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 06.02.2006 opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests show the importance of communication between the west and the islamic world the conflict raging over the caricatures of the prophet mohammed shows no sign of abating .
since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .
due to the fact that many european countries are home to fast-growing and often poorly integrated muslim minorities , discord like that which is bubbling over now could threaten the long-term peace in their societies . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons leading politicians have sharply criticized the escalating violence in the arab world over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed , even as muslim leaders are now calling for calm and restraint .
-lrb- feb .
6 , 2006 -rrb- analysis : arab protests are calculated political response mass protests , threats of violence and boycotts in the arab world are exaggerated reactions to the mohammed cartoon and an example of how governments instrumentalize hatred against the west for political purposes .

" the uneven pitch is the reason why we can not play better at home , " he added . former leverkusen favorite michael ballack , who helped the club reach the 2002 champions league final , scored the vital goal on 36 minutes chesting the ball before dispatching a brilliant volley into the net . it was bayern 's 16th win in 19th games and continued a remarkable run for munich goalkeeper oliver kahn who has not tasted defeat in a home match against bayer for 16 games . hamburg recover to keep title hopes alive third-placed sv hamburg remain a point behind werder bremen and they also needed to come from behind to secure the spoils in a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergei barbarez completed the comeback with the winner hamburg , the only german team to beat bayern this season , stayed in touch with bremen despite falling behind to an isaac boakye goal which put visitors arminia ahead on 26 minutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.02.2006 iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian nuclear workers are on standby to restart enrichment iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .
at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .
" solving the iranian nuclear issue is the key task for the immediate future unless we want an arms race in the middle east , " steinmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , rumsfeld urge world to act on iran threat german chancellor angela merkel and us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged the world to prevent the islamic republic from developing a nuclear weapon .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .

" we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained .

" i am horrified to see the way violence and attacks are spreading throughout the middle east , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told reporters hours after lebanese demonstrators set fire to its embassy there in clashes that left at least 28 people injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim cleric looks on as the danish mission in beirut burns " the actions in lebanon and syria yesterday are beyond comprehension and totally unacceptable , " he said . the attacks " can by no means be legitimized and are utterly unacceptable , " said austria , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency . " violence is unacceptable " the spiraling row also found mention at the annual munich security conference over the weekend , with german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticizing the violence . merkel said she understood that the mohammed cartoons had hurt the religious sentiments of muslims , but said the violent anti-danish reactions to the cartoons were unacceptable . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was following developments with increasing concern and appealed to " all rational forces to counter the false prophet of the culture clash . " speaking at a meeting in the eastern german city of dresden along with the presidents of finland , italy , latvia , austria , portugal and hungary , german president horst köhler said the events were unacceptable . " violence and threats are not acceptable under any circumstances , " köhler said . escalating controversy the controversy , first sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed in danish newspaper jyllands-posten last september , has escalated ever since media in norway , france , germany , italy , spain and several other mostly european countries have reproduced some or all the dozen caricatures . muslims and their governments have called the images blasphemous and contrary to islamic tradition prohibiting depictions of mohammed .
one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .
there were no reports of danish casualties in any of the incidents . the first fatalities in over a week of protests were reported in afghanistan on monday .
three afghans were killed at a rally in the eastern city of mihtarlam when police fired on demonstrators after a police station came under attack . afghanistan has seen huge demonstrations over the past few days with thousands of people taking to the streets in protest .
hundreds of muslims protested in kandahar and mazar-e-sharif , while 200 demonstrators gathered outside the danish embassy in the capital , kabul . in protests in the north-eastern province of takhar , demonstrators threw stones at government buildings and police fired in the air . in somalia , a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after protesters attacked the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor waves an islamic flag in front of the burning danish mission in beirut in beirut on sunday , thousands of protesters rampaged through the christian area of ashrafiyeh , throwing stones , breaking windows and overturning cars .
they defied police firing tear gas to storm the danish embassy building using ladders .
there they hacked at walls and windows with axes and poles and set the place ablaze , sending thick smoke billowing into the sky . denmark 's red-and-white flag was set alight . anger was vivid in the palestinian territories , too .
in the west bank city of nablus , 20 palestinian gunmen stormed the french cultural center and spray-painted a cross over its front door with a slogan reading : " closed until your country apologizes . " similar action was taken against the german cultural center in gaza city on saturday and against eu offices last week . muslim leaders appeal for calm leading figures in the muslim world are now stepping in to call for calm and restraint . afghan president hamid karzai urged muslims worldwide to remain peaceful , and added that muslims should be above violence and not stoop to the same level as those who published the cartoons .
karzai said that the prophet mohammed was much too exalted to be insulted by mere cartoons . the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , a group of 57 muslim countries , agreed to a meeting with danish foreign minister per stig moeller over the row .
the oic also criticized the attacks on scandinavian embassies and said it condemned these " regrettable " incidents . it added that the reactions were " overblown " and " dangerous and hindered efforts to defend the just causes of the muslim world .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 06.02.2006 opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests show the importance of communication between the west and the islamic world the conflict raging over the caricatures of the prophet mohammed shows no sign of abating .
since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .
due to the fact that many european countries are home to fast-growing and often poorly integrated muslim minorities , discord like that which is bubbling over now could threaten the long-term peace in their societies . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons leading politicians have sharply criticized the escalating violence in the arab world over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed , even as muslim leaders are now calling for calm and restraint .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .

it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .
" solving the iranian nuclear issue is the key task for the immediate future unless we want an arms race in the middle east , " steinmeier said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , rumsfeld urge world to act on iran threat german chancellor angela merkel and us defense secretary donald rumsfeld urged the world to prevent the islamic republic from developing a nuclear weapon .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict cartoon controversy reflects deeper problems in denmark europe -pipe- 06.02.2006 opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests show the importance of communication between the west and the islamic world the conflict raging over the caricatures of the prophet mohammed shows no sign of abating .
since both the western and islamic worlds have tended to demonize the other , a real dialog between them is absolutely necessary . the outrage about the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in many parts of the muslim world is real and should be taken seriously .
still , one thing should not be overlooked : when western institutions are stormed or set on fire , or people are threatened only because of their european heritage and not because they have had anything to do with the issue , that has less to do with islam and more to do with the interests of radical ideologues , who have grasped how to use this argument for their own purposes . mindless violence is unacceptable and can not be justified by claiming god or the prophet mohammed has been insulted .
in addition , it is not at all reflecting the interests of a majority of the world 's muslims . nonetheless , the current developments are alarming .
it is dismaying to see how many people , particularly in arabic countries , appear to be ready to engage in violent demonstrations .
it is frightening how few courageous voices from the islamic world spoke out initially against the threats and escalating violence .
there are several notable exceptions , particularly palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and syria 's grand mufti , sheikh ahmed badreddine hassun , who talked about " miserable actions . "
and not to be forgotten , of course , are the numerous muslim representatives in european countries . however , one hoped for many more moderate voices from the middle east .
instead , it was the fire-setters who set the tone on the streets and on television , along with tens of thousands of politically frustrated and uninformed people who backed them up . wester n stereotypes in the west , another picture surfaced , equally disconcerting .
it was one in which little differentiation is made between radical and moderate muslims , and which leads to islam being equated with terrorism and violence .
every attack , every political assassination and every kidnapping strengthens this picture in the minds of many westerners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors burn a symbolic danish flag in srinagar , india still , it is a false impression , and adhering to it only supports those who wish to sow as much distrust and enmity between the western and islamic worlds as possible . it took this intense reaction in the middle east to wake up european leaders to the fact that the cartoon debate is about more than press freedom .
it is really about respect that must be shown for the values and traditions of a religion , which for years more than any other has been used to advance for extremist political causes . that several european newspapers - german ones included - demonstratively reprinted the caricatures was perhaps not meant to hurt sensibilities , but its effect was something akin to childish defiance hiding behind the pathos of press freedom .
in reality , press freedom is not , and never was , threatened .
but religious feelings were wounded , and radical ideologists were handed a cheap pretence for violence .
the gulf between the two cultures was almost willfully widened .
one should also remember , caricatures of this kind , at least in germany with its nazi past , would have provoked an uproar if not muslims but jews had been caricatured in a similar way . moderation and reason is called for on both sides .
these past few days in gaza , tehran and jakarta have shown that a dialogue between the two cultures must be taken more seriously than ever .
it ca n't be limited to a few well-meaning pastors and imams , but should be engaged in at all levels , from the street to the corridors of power .
germany 's federal president horst köhler rightly stressed that europe must contribute to this .
due to the fact that many european countries are home to fast-growing and often poorly integrated muslim minorities , discord like that which is bubbling over now could threaten the long-term peace in their societies . rainer sollich -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons leading politicians have sharply criticized the escalating violence in the arab world over danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed , even as muslim leaders are now calling for calm and restraint .

" i am horrified to see the way violence and attacks are spreading throughout the middle east , " danish foreign minister per stig moeller told reporters hours after lebanese demonstrators set fire to its embassy there in clashes that left at least 28 people injured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim cleric looks on as the danish mission in beirut burns " the actions in lebanon and syria yesterday are beyond comprehension and totally unacceptable , " he said . the attacks " can by no means be legitimized and are utterly unacceptable , " said austria , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency . " violence is unacceptable " the spiraling row also found mention at the annual munich security conference over the weekend , with german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticizing the violence . merkel said she understood that the mohammed cartoons had hurt the religious sentiments of muslims , but said the violent anti-danish reactions to the cartoons were unacceptable . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was following developments with increasing concern and appealed to " all rational forces to counter the false prophet of the culture clash . " speaking at a meeting in the eastern german city of dresden along with the presidents of finland , italy , latvia , austria , portugal and hungary , german president horst köhler said the events were unacceptable . " violence and threats are not acceptable under any circumstances , " köhler said . escalating controversy the controversy , first sparked by the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed in danish newspaper jyllands-posten last september , has escalated ever since media in norway , france , germany , italy , spain and several other mostly european countries have reproduced some or all the dozen caricatures . muslims and their governments have called the images blasphemous and contrary to islamic tradition prohibiting depictions of mohammed .
one of the cartoons , showing mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse , was especially contentious . european governments have stressed they have no control over media in their countries , and have sided with arguments that freedom of expression outweighs respect for religions in their secular societies . but the row - which some observers have called " a clash of civilizations " - shows no sign of dying down despite widespread calls for calm . first deaths reported as afghans come under fire from police denmark urged its nationals to leave lebanon and syria on the weekend after angry muslim mobs torched its embassy buildings in both countries . nearly 1,000 people also protested in eastern afghanistan on sunday and demanded the expulsion of danish forces based there as part of a nato deployment .

it is the first widespread public-sector strike in 14 years and threatens to grow larger . hospitals , pre-schools and administration offices were affected , and trash was not collected , according to the service industry trade union ver.di.
about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .
ver.di says this amounts to a salary cut of 4 percent . the union wants to force the regional authorities to implement public-service wage accords that were due to take effect in oct .
2005 .
in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage . " on the one hand germany has five million unemployed and on the other the employers want to prolong the working week for those newly employed , " ver.di chief frank bsirske said , arguing that this would increase unemployment further .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di chief frank bsirske in a radio interview over the weekend , bsirske said the union would not be dictated to by employers and accused them of trying to entrench longer working hours across the whole economy . could spread last week civil servants in the northern state of lower saxony went on strike against the measures and staged protest marches . ver.di members subsequently voted by a large majority on extending the strike and bsirske has warned that it could spread throughout the country .
workers in other states - bavaria , lower saxony , schleswig-holstein , saarland and saxony - are set to vote this week whether to stage stoppages as early as next monday . bavarian premier edmund stoiber told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that germany 's public administration could no longer afford a 38.5-hour week . " the coffers are empty , " he said .
" there 's no room to maneuver .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .

it is the first widespread public-sector strike in 14 years and threatens to grow larger . hospitals , pre-schools and administration offices were affected , and trash was not collected , according to the service industry trade union ver.di.
about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .
ver.di says this amounts to a salary cut of 4 percent . the union wants to force the regional authorities to implement public-service wage accords that were due to take effect in oct .
2005 .
in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage . " on the one hand germany has five million unemployed and on the other the employers want to prolong the working week for those newly employed , " ver.di chief frank bsirske said , arguing that this would increase unemployment further .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di chief frank bsirske in a radio interview over the weekend , bsirske said the union would not be dictated to by employers and accused them of trying to entrench longer working hours across the whole economy . could spread last week civil servants in the northern state of lower saxony went on strike against the measures and staged protest marches . ver.di members subsequently voted by a large majority on extending the strike and bsirske has warned that it could spread throughout the country .
workers in other states - bavaria , lower saxony , schleswig-holstein , saarland and saxony - are set to vote this week whether to stage stoppages as early as next monday . bavarian premier edmund stoiber told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that germany 's public administration could no longer afford a 38.5-hour week . " the coffers are empty , " he said .
" there 's no room to maneuver .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .

that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .

the first of those goals came after just 14 seconds scored by egyptian international mohamed zidan - the sixth fastest in bundesliga history . but bremen showed great character to level and then clinched the points with paraguayan international nelson valdez bagging a brace . " we were watching our opponents and deserved to go 2-0 down , " confessed bremen manager thomas schaaf .

" he did not know if he was allowed to celebrate , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . zidan took advantage of some woeful defending to fire the fastest goal of the season and niclas weiland added another on 13 minutes to leave bremen staring defeat in the face . former bayern munich striker giovanni elber and ex-bayer leverkusen striker ulf kirsten hold the record for the fastest ever bundesliga goal at 11 seconds .
elber set the record in 1998 and kirsten equaled the mark in 2002 . but bremen average 2.5 goals a game in the bundesliga and produced an amazing comeback with valdez pulling a goal back on 39 minutes before frenchman johan micoud and croatian international ivan klasnic scored two more in first half stoppage time . valdez added another to show their prowess in front of goal but italian champions juventus , their last 16 champions league opponents on february 22 , will have noted the defensive flaws with interest .

" the uneven pitch is the reason why we can not play better at home , " he added . former leverkusen favorite michael ballack , who helped the club reach the 2002 champions league final , scored the vital goal on 36 minutes chesting the ball before dispatching a brilliant volley into the net . it was bayern 's 16th win in 19th games and continued a remarkable run for munich goalkeeper oliver kahn who has not tasted defeat in a home match against bayer for 16 games . hamburg recover to keep title hopes alive third-placed sv hamburg remain a point behind werder bremen and they also needed to come from behind to secure the spoils in a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergei barbarez completed the comeback with the winner hamburg , the only german team to beat bayern this season , stayed in touch with bremen despite falling behind to an isaac boakye goal which put visitors arminia ahead on 26 minutes .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .

now the blessing is becoming a curse as a legal wrangle over ownership drags on . the coastal town of boltenhagen was never one to draw much attention to itself ; an unpretentious german sea resort popular with families and the elderly which attracted a loyal clientele in the summer months .
it enjoyed its reputation as a not-so-well kept secret on germany 's east coast - until new year 's eve in 2004 when a mysterious visitor from the sea decided to make her home in the water of the town 's bay . overnight , boltenhagen 's fortunes changed .
for now there dwelt in the nearby waters a sea nymph ; a bronze and brazenly naked mermaid which had seemingly and mysteriously surfaced from the sea to become a monument to perkiness on a rock just off the coast . where had the ample stranger come from ?
why had she chosen boltenhagen as the place to display her charms ? the locals debated these and other questions very briefly before turning their attention to marketing the statue for all it was worth .
thousands of visitors flocked to the town to view the busty maiden and buy postcards , figurines and even souvenir coffee cups in the shape of the nymphs more obvious assets . boltenhagen 's health resort director dieter dunkelmann described her arrival as " a gift from the gods " as envious glances burned in emerald eyes from resorts further up the coast . a mercha n disi n g dream tur n s i n to a n ightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east sea resort attracts many visitors , not all as shapely as the mermaid .
but while the town boomed on the back - and the front - of the maiden 's arrival , the question of how she got to be stuck out there on a rock would just not go away for some people .
while the mystery was a good story and reason to flog seaside tat to gullible tourists , nagging doubts began to gnaw at the blessed community of boltenhagen . the period of joy and prosperity the mermaid had brought to the town was not to be eternal .
a report in the regional edition of bild tabloid did much to change the mood when it published an article claiming that while the statue itself was not human , the person and inspiration behind its arrival most certainly was . the paper revealed that kathrin nonnenmacher , a businesswoman from wörth in western germany , had secured the rights to the term " baltic sea nymph " for her company in may 2005 .
she subsequently wanted a slice of the boltenhagen merchandising pie . legal actio n threate n ed far from being the benevolent incarnation of the magical mermaid , ms. nonnenmacher , a former beauty queen , turned out to be the bane of boltenhagen .
last november , the former beauty queen issued an order for all souvenir sales in the town to cease .
she reportedly threatened one merchandiser with a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 301,200 -rrb- lawsuit if sales of " baltic sea nymph " -products did not desist . anyone , who wanted mermaid-associated products would have to order them from her company , which sells everything from nymph candles to nymph pill boxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kathrin nonnenmacher was miss rhineland-palatinate in 2002 the town reacted angrily and a war of words ensued over ownership of the statue , one that continues to rage .
nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

nonnenmacher has claimed that only the creator of the statue could challenge her claim to the rights but has denied that she knows the sculptor , that she commissioned the work or that it had been modeled on her physique . a national treasure ? the people of boltenhagen continue to vehemently defend their claim that the statue belongs to them as it is a permanent fixture within its boundaries and are therefore entitled to use it as they see fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea nymph 's world famous colleague , copenhagen 's little mermaid , has been mutilated but is not copyrighted enter the water and shipping office -lrb- wsa -rrb- in lübeck into the fight .
the state department responsible for the shipping lanes in the boltenhagen bay has since ruled that the statue no longer had the right to feature in a " federal waterway " as there apparently is no record of it being granted any official planning permission . however , lawyers for the wsa say that removing the statue may also prove problematic as the nymph is attached to the rock which is , technically , a part of the federal republic of germany .
that , in legal terms at least , could mean that the german state is the owner of the statue ; leaving both nonnenmacher and the people of boltenhagen out of pocket and the state of germany in possession of an extremely comely addition to its culture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vandals go after mermaid with dynamite the little mermaid , the famous statue in copenhagen , is on her way to becoming “ europe ’ s most abused landmark . ”

it is the first widespread public-sector strike in 14 years and threatens to grow larger . hospitals , pre-schools and administration offices were affected , and trash was not collected , according to the service industry trade union ver.di.
about 10,000 workers are expected to picket and union officials have said they are prepared for a four to six-week action . the dispute centers on efforts by public-service employers to extend the working week for employees from 38.5 to 40 hours without a concomitant rise in pay .
ver.di says this amounts to a salary cut of 4 percent . the union wants to force the regional authorities to implement public-service wage accords that were due to take effect in oct .

in a strike vote , almost 95 percent of union members came out in favor of a work stoppage . " on the one hand germany has five million unemployed and on the other the employers want to prolong the working week for those newly employed , " ver.di chief frank bsirske said , arguing that this would increase unemployment further .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di chief frank bsirske in a radio interview over the weekend , bsirske said the union would not be dictated to by employers and accused them of trying to entrench longer working hours across the whole economy . could spread last week civil servants in the northern state of lower saxony went on strike against the measures and staged protest marches . ver.di members subsequently voted by a large majority on extending the strike and bsirske has warned that it could spread throughout the country .

at the same time , tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that russian options were being considered . iran said monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work , the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons , will begin in " due course " in response to the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- decision to report the clerical regime to the un security council . " the order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and iran will resume its work , " government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters , referring to an order from hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad . but when asked to say what specific work had already resumed - and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action - he replied that " technical issues are the concern of the atomic energy organization of iran . " " they will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work .
the atomic energy organization will give its order in due course , " elham said . enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges .
when purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iran had agreed to suspend this work , as well as centrifuge assembly , as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with britain , france and germany . the current crisis was sparked by iran 's decision last august to resume uranium conversion - which makes the gas fed into centrifuges - and start laboratory-scale enrichment on jan .
10 . enrichment announcement in retaliation to iaea decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea meeting saturday led to a decision to refer iran to the un the kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against saturday 's vote by the iaea 's 35-nation board to report iran to the un security council , a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes tehran to the threat of sanctions . the country , which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy , announced sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities . " we are now at the end of one phase where the islamic republic was building trust , going beyond its non-proliferation treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol , " elham explained . " there has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result .
but now the door for voluntary measures has been closed .
what remains open is the door of negotiation , " he added . " our use of nuclear technology is very transparent , and as the president has said , we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the npt .
iran dos not have any plans to get out of the npt . " iranian president laughs at " idiots " behind un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has laughed off threats of sanctions ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded iran 's international opponents as " idiots , " while elham insisted the resolution was a " victory " for the islamic republic . " from our position it was a victory .
the government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory .
the breaking of the consensus on the iaea board was a victory .
and the position of the west shows the second and third generation of the islamic republic that they do n't want iran to progress , and that too is a victory , " he insisted . he also asserted that oil-rich iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions . " energy is a matter for the west , and we are not interested in causing problems for them .
any decision in this regard will not hurt us .
it will hurt the consumers and not the producers .
we are in a position of power when it comes to energy , and it will not have any affect on our budget , " he said . the spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime - dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives - on how to handle the escalation crisis . " we deal within the framework of the regime , and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy .
nothing special has happened in this regard , " elham said . iran ready to negotiate with russia over enrichment offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin hopes to offer iran a way out of the international crisis however , in what was interpreted as a sign that iran was still ready to negotiate , tehran said that russia 's offer to shift iran 's uranium enrichment to russian territory was still up for discussion . before iaea voted to report the iranian nuclear program to the security council on saturday , iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons . iran on sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the russian proposal . steinmeier : russian proposal a way back to diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says solving the iran crisis is a key task german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday urged iran to accept the russian proposal , saying it " can be the key to a negotiated solution . " the decision taken by the iaea to report iran to the un security council " a show of international unity " , steinmeier said .
" it was a very strong and determined signal to the iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program . " germany 's top diplomat said the iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world .

sara reid said she wants to see more counselling services in schools and a helpline for parents worried about their children .
figures show the suicide rate among 11-17s in wales , although small , is five times higher than in england .
two boys have apparently killed themselves in wales in the last month .
ms reid told the bbc news website : " i think the statistics are disturbing , but as usual they only tell part of the story .
" perhaps some research needs to be carried out to find out the story behind those statistics - we need to look for the possible reasons for the figures . "
one of the resources we are pressing the assembly to act on now is on access to counselling for school children sara reid uk government figures show the average suicide rate between 1994-2004 among young people in wales was five times higher than in the same age group in england .
the numbers are based on suicide verdicts recorded by coroners and do not include open verdicts , which are often given when the coroner believes the victim was making a " cry for help " and did not mean to kill themselves .
ms reid said she has had " concerns for a number of years " about the assembly government 's implementation of its child and adolescent mental health strategy , everybody 's business .
" the funding has come in a piecemeal way rather than funding the strategy as a whole , " she said .
" i think there are a lot of very committed professionals in statutory and voluntary sectors who are working very hard .
" but the information we have had from them is that they feel what they provide is a cinderella service and the resources simply are not there to do everything they would like . "
' big challenges ' ms reid told the bbc " early intervention " was crucial to prevent a young person taking their own life .
" one of the things we are pressing the assembly to act on now is access to counselling for school children , " she added .
nathan smith , 14 , from neath , was found hanged in his home on 22 january 2006 .
just three days later , jonathan reynolds , 15 , from bridgend , died after apparently lying down in front of a train .
head teacher margaret evitts , who has attended funerals of former pupils who had committed suicide , believes schools do need to develop counselling services .
ms evitts , head of gungrog infant school in welshpool , said : " jane davidson -lsb- welsh education minister -rsb- ought to be looking at that as part of the extended school agenda .

"
but ms reid would also like to see more help offered to parents .
" there is lots of information for new parents - but the really big challenges for them come in teenage years , " she said .
the assistant commissioner wants the assembly to set up a parents ' helpline , similar to the parentline plus service provided in england .
the welsh assembly government has said it is concerned and is working to implement its parenting action plan which includes a bilingual telephone helpline .
it is also working on a strategy for counselling school children and is seeking to strengthen mental health services for children and young people .
senior psychology lecturer clare o 'connell said there were classic symptoms for parents and teachers to watch for if they were worried a young person was considering suicide .
they included " excessive risk taking " and a " preoccupation with death and dying " , she said .
but she told the bbc the most important point was not to dismiss " suicidal talk " in young people .
" most people who commit suicide have already talked about it - you should take notice and listen , " she said .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- zambia : fertile but hungry bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 6 february 2006 , 08:21 gmt zambia : fertile but hungry by peter biles bbc southern africa correspondent as you drive around the zambian countryside , to the north and south of the capital , lusaka , it is sometimes difficult to understand why there is a food crisis in this country .
the fields are green , fertile and full of maize .
there is also an abundance of water .
it has been raining heavily .
these are promising signs for the forthcoming harvest .
however , the food shortages that zambians are experiencing at present , with more than 1.2m people in need of food assistance this year , stem from the drought in 2004-5 .
like many other countries in sub-saharan africa , this is about far more than just poor rainfall .
there are deeper , long-term problems that cause hunger .
lost out for the last five years , emily miyanda and her husband , steve , have run pamusha farm , about 15km from lusaka . "
we 'd like some government support in buying seeds and fertiliser " farmer emily miyanda in a near perfect setting , the well-irrigated seven-hectare farm produces maize , cabbages , tomatoes and other vegetables .
" we 're employing local workers here and helping the government to secure jobs .
but in return , we 'd like some government support in buying seeds and fertiliser .
that would make life easier , " says emily miyanda .
zambian farmers lost out on subsidised agricultural inputs when tough world bank and international monetary fund conditions were imposed .
however , zambia 's minister of agriculture mundia sikatana admits that more must now be done to help small farmers like the miyanda family .
" we are giving fertiliser and seeds to 150,000 farmers but that 's not enough .
it 's a drop in the ocean .
one million small farmers need assistance , " he said .
" we hope to improve on our numbers in this year 's budget because it 's much cheaper for the country to support the farmer than to import food " .
food exporter in the meantime , farmers are being urged to diversify and end their over-dependence on maize .
some are turning to sorghum , sweet potatoes and ground nuts .
mr sikatana says he would also like to see zambians growing cassava , a crop much favoured in neighbouring angola and democratic republic of congo .
in this way , zambia would have the potential of returning to the days when it was a food exporter .
one problem for farmers is access to markets .
in spite of the fact that the lusaka skyline lies in the distance , pamusha farm can only be reached by several kilometres of poor dirt roads .
" some of the roads in zambia are just impassable , " says henry malumo , co-ordinator of the global call to action against poverty .
" the issue of infrastructure is a major one .
there 's no way you can expect peasant farmers to lift themselves out of poverty when there are such bad roads . "
farming sector decimated in the rural communities , hunger is directly related to poverty . "
the pupils come from families that are poor .
they are starving " teacher gift shiyanga at the kapopo primary school in the naluyanda district near lusaka , teacher gift shiyanga says that around half the 500 children are not getting enough food .
" they come from families that are poor .
they are starving , " he says .
perhaps the biggest cause of food insecurity in southern africa is the hiv / aids crisis .
this has decimated the farming sector .
ninety minutes ' drive south of lusaka is the farming town of mazabuka .
the ndeke community centre there provides support for those who are chronically ill , most of whom are hiv positive .
hunger trap under a thatched rondavel hut , 30-year old gideon lungu sits listlessly in the summer heat .
he is suffering from tuberculosis , and like many here , he looks gaunt and weak .
" most of these people are farmers who can no longer work their fields , " says samuel banda who works for a local non-governmental organisation called programme urban self help -lrb- push -rrb- .

the fields are green , fertile and full of maize .
there is also an abundance of water .
it has been raining heavily .
these are promising signs for the forthcoming harvest .
however , the food shortages that zambians are experiencing at present , with more than 1.2m people in need of food assistance this year , stem from the drought in 2004-5 .
like many other countries in sub-saharan africa , this is about far more than just poor rainfall .
there are deeper , long-term problems that cause hunger .
lost out for the last five years , emily miyanda and her husband , steve , have run pamusha farm , about 15km from lusaka .
we 'd like some government support in buying seeds and fertiliser farmer emily miyanda in a near perfect setting , the well-irrigated seven-hectare farm produces maize , cabbages , tomatoes and other vegetables .
" we 're employing local workers here and helping the government to secure jobs .
but in return , we 'd like some government support in buying seeds and fertiliser .
that would make life easier , " says emily miyanda .
zambian farmers lost out on subsidised agricultural inputs when tough world bank and international monetary fund conditions were imposed .
however , zambia 's minister of agriculture mundia sikatana admits that more must now be done to help small farmers like the miyanda family .
" we are giving fertiliser and seeds to 150,000 farmers but that 's not enough .
it 's a drop in the ocean .
one million small farmers need assistance , " he said .
" we hope to improve on our numbers in this year 's budget because it 's much cheaper for the country to support the farmer than to import food " .
food exporter in the meantime , farmers are being urged to diversify and end their over-dependence on maize .
some are turning to sorghum , sweet potatoes and ground nuts .
grandparents often care for the young in rural communities mr sikatana says he would also like to see zambians growing cassava , a crop much favoured in neighbouring angola and democratic republic of congo .
in this way , zambia would have the potential of returning to the days when it was a food exporter .
one problem for farmers is access to markets .
in spite of the fact that the lusaka skyline lies in the distance , pamusha farm can only be reached by several kilometres of poor dirt roads .
" some of the roads in zambia are just impassable , " says henry malumo , co-ordinator of the global call to action against poverty .
" the issue of infrastructure is a major one .
there 's no way you can expect peasant farmers to lift themselves out of poverty when there are such bad roads . "
farming sector decimated in the rural communities , hunger is directly related to poverty .
the pupils come from families that are poor .
they are starving teacher gift shiyanga at the kapopo primary school in the naluyanda district near lusaka , teacher gift shiyanga says that around half the 500 children are not getting enough food .
" they come from families that are poor .
they are starving , " he says .
perhaps the biggest cause of food insecurity in southern africa is the hiv / aids crisis .
this has decimated the farming sector .
ninety minutes ' drive south of lusaka is the farming town of mazabuka .
the ndeke community centre there provides support for those who are chronically ill , most of whom are hiv positive .
hunger trap under a thatched rondavel hut , 30-year old gideon lungu sits listlessly in the summer heat .
he is suffering from tuberculosis , and like many here , he looks gaunt and weak .

the fields are green , fertile and full of maize .
there is also an abundance of water .
it has been raining heavily .
these are promising signs for the forthcoming harvest .
however , the food shortages that zambians are experiencing at present , with more than 1.2m people in need of food assistance this year , stem from the drought in 2004-5 .
like many other countries in sub-saharan africa , this is about far more than just poor rainfall .
there are deeper , long-term problems that cause hunger .
lost out for the last five years , emily miyanda and her husband , steve , have run pamusha farm , about 15km from lusaka .
we 'd like some government support in buying seeds and fertiliser farmer emily miyanda in a near perfect setting , the well-irrigated seven-hectare farm produces maize , cabbages , tomatoes and other vegetables .
" we 're employing local workers here and helping the government to secure jobs .
but in return , we 'd like some government support in buying seeds and fertiliser .
that would make life easier , " says emily miyanda .
zambian farmers lost out on subsidised agricultural inputs when tough world bank and international monetary fund conditions were imposed .
however , zambia 's minister of agriculture mundia sikatana admits that more must now be done to help small farmers like the miyanda family .
" we are giving fertiliser and seeds to 150,000 farmers but that 's not enough .
it 's a drop in the ocean .
one million small farmers need assistance , " he said .
" we hope to improve on our numbers in this year 's budget because it 's much cheaper for the country to support the farmer than to import food " .
food exporter in the meantime , farmers are being urged to diversify and end their over-dependence on maize .
some are turning to sorghum , sweet potatoes and ground nuts .
grandparents often care for the young in rural communities mr sikatana says he would also like to see zambians growing cassava , a crop much favoured in neighbouring angola and democratic republic of congo .
in this way , zambia would have the potential of returning to the days when it was a food exporter .
one problem for farmers is access to markets .
in spite of the fact that the lusaka skyline lies in the distance , pamusha farm can only be reached by several kilometres of poor dirt roads .
" some of the roads in zambia are just impassable , " says henry malumo , co-ordinator of the global call to action against poverty .
" the issue of infrastructure is a major one .
there 's no way you can expect peasant farmers to lift themselves out of poverty when there are such bad roads . "
farming sector decimated in the rural communities , hunger is directly related to poverty .
the pupils come from families that are poor .
they are starving teacher gift shiyanga at the kapopo primary school in the naluyanda district near lusaka , teacher gift shiyanga says that around half the 500 children are not getting enough food .
" they come from families that are poor .
they are starving , " he says .
perhaps the biggest cause of food insecurity in southern africa is the hiv / aids crisis .
this has decimated the farming sector .
ninety minutes ' drive south of lusaka is the farming town of mazabuka .
the ndeke community centre there provides support for those who are chronically ill , most of whom are hiv positive .
hunger trap under a thatched rondavel hut , 30-year old gideon lungu sits listlessly in the summer heat .

by paula dear and finlo rohrer bbc news , in northampton as the government plans a national tour to promote its respect agenda , published last month , the bbc news website is taking a snapshot of the issues in one english town in a week-long series .
it would be cruel to dub northampton as everytown uk , but in many areas of life it is statistically average .
in factors such as ethnic make-up , faith groups , average earnings and numbers of council house tenants , the figures are close to those for england and wales as a whole .
although the area has suffered from the decline of its once-renowned shoe manufacturing industry , it still enjoys relatively low unemployment - currently at 3.2 % compared with 4.8 % across england , scotland and wales .
northampton , which has a population of around 200,000 , does contain deprived areas , ranking 135th on a scale where one is the most deprived and 354 the least .
it is the kind of ordinary place with ordinary problems which will be the crucible of tony blair 's respect agenda as in many towns , much of the deprivation is on housing estates , many built as the town rapidly expanded in the 1970s to accommodate london overspill .
its councils and police force have had more than their fair share of criticism .

by paula dear and finlo rohrer bbc news , in northampton as the government plans a national tour to promote its respect agenda , published last month , the bbc news website is taking a snapshot of the issues in one english town in a week-long series .
it would be cruel to dub northampton as everytown uk , but in many areas of life it is statistically average .
in factors such as ethnic make-up , faith groups , average earnings and numbers of council house tenants , the figures are close to those for england and wales as a whole .
although the area has suffered from the decline of its once-renowned shoe manufacturing industry , it still enjoys relatively low unemployment - currently at 3.2 % compared with 4.8 % across england , scotland and wales .
northampton , which has a population of around 200,000 , does contain deprived areas , ranking 135th on a scale where one is the most deprived and 354 the least .
it is the kind of ordinary place with ordinary problems which will be the crucible of tony blair 's respect agenda as in many towns , much of the deprivation is on housing estates , many built as the town rapidly expanded in the 1970s to accommodate london overspill .
its councils and police force have had more than their fair share of criticism .
northampton borough council has been dubbed the " poorest of the poor " by local government minister phil woolas .
northampton : respect down the ages 1787 : thousands watch as the notorious culworth gang are publicly executed for robberies 1812 : prime minister spencer perceval -lrb- northampton 's mp -rrb- is shot dead in house of commons lobby 1874 : riot in town is provoked by election campaign involving radical atheist charles bradlaugh 1898 : local motor car pioneer joseph grose incurs the first speeding fine , of £ 1 , for travelling at 15-16mph 1952 : controversial " woman with fish " statue has to be moved after repeated vandalism source : www.northampton.org.uk the police have been castigated for their poor performance , and the county council is currently under fire for cutting services .
but all are resolute in their drive to tackle anti-social behaviour .
residents concerns are typically of groups of youths hanging around and causing a nuisance , graffiti and vandalism , the prevalence of drug use , and a feeling of lack of security .
in northampton , crime and anti-social behaviour partnerships -lrb- caspars -rrb- have targeted particular areas with measures to improve safety and reduce crime , and the fear of crime .
a neighbourhood warden scheme is currently being expanded , and initiatives such as dispersal orders have had some success in trouble hot spots , albeit temporarily .
in illustrating what real people 's views and experiences were , the aim was not to scour the country in search of the worst cases of anti-social behaviour and disrespect , but to find an ' average ' town that would speak for most people 's experiences .
northampton is not a london , a manchester or a newcastle , or a sleepy commuter town .
it is the kind of ordinary place with ordinary problems which will be the crucible of tony blair 's respect agenda .

by paula dear and finlo rohrer bbc news , in northampton as the government plans a national tour to promote its respect agenda , published last month , the bbc news website is taking a snapshot of the issues in one english town in a week-long series .
it would be cruel to dub northampton as everytown uk , but in many areas of life it is statistically average .
in factors such as ethnic make-up , faith groups , average earnings and numbers of council house tenants , the figures are close to those for england and wales as a whole .
although the area has suffered from the decline of its once-renowned shoe manufacturing industry , it still enjoys relatively low unemployment - currently at 3.2 % compared with 4.8 % across england , scotland and wales .
northampton , which has a population of around 200,000 , does contain deprived areas , ranking 135th on a scale where one is the most deprived and 354 the least .
it is the kind of ordinary place with ordinary problems which will be the crucible of tony blair 's respect agenda as in many towns , much of the deprivation is on housing estates , many built as the town rapidly expanded in the 1970s to accommodate london overspill .
its councils and police force have had more than their fair share of criticism .
northampton borough council has been dubbed the " poorest of the poor " by local government minister phil woolas .
northampton : respect down the ages 1787 : thousands watch as the notorious culworth gang are publicly executed for robberies 1812 : prime minister spencer perceval -lrb- northampton 's mp -rrb- is shot dead in house of commons lobby 1874 : riot in town is provoked by election campaign involving radical atheist charles bradlaugh 1898 : local motor car pioneer joseph grose incurs the first speeding fine , of £ 1 , for travelling at 15-16mph 1952 : controversial " woman with fish " statue has to be moved after repeated vandalism source : www.northampton.org.uk the police have been castigated for their poor performance , and the county council is currently under fire for cutting services .
but all are resolute in their drive to tackle anti-social behaviour .
residents concerns are typically of groups of youths hanging around and causing a nuisance , graffiti and vandalism , the prevalence of drug use , and a feeling of lack of security .
in northampton , crime and anti-social behaviour partnerships -lrb- caspars -rrb- have targeted particular areas with measures to improve safety and reduce crime , and the fear of crime .
a neighbourhood warden scheme is currently being expanded , and initiatives such as dispersal orders have had some success in trouble hot spots , albeit temporarily .
in illustrating what real people 's views and experiences were , the aim was not to scour the country in search of the worst cases of anti-social behaviour and disrespect , but to find an ' average ' town that would speak for most people 's experiences .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- euro gas pipe ' hits uk consumer ' bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies monday , 6 february 2006 , 09:01 gmt euro gas pipe ' hits uk consumer ' uk consumers have paid an extra £ 300m for gas this winter because of problems with the european gas supply system , british gas owner centrica has said .
centrica said a lack of competition had made it difficult to get enough gas to meet demand at peak times .
it added that the way gas contracts are currently structured - being linked to the price of oil - could cost european consumers as much as £ 40bn this year .
the report comes as politicians prepare to discuss the uk gas market on monday .
the parliamentary trade & industry select committee is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the changing uk energy environment .
gas prices have become a worry for consumers and policymakers alike as the uk produces less from its fields and relies more on imports from europe . "
europe 's failure to open up its energy markets is costing uk customers dear " mark clare , managing director of british gas with supplies being squeezed , the cost of wholesale gas has increased by 70 % over the past 12 months and has trebled since 2003 .
greater freedom suppliers have warned that prices are likely to rise , and there have been suggestions in the media that the increase may be as much as 25 % .
this would make the average household bill about £ 1,000 a year .
duncan sedgewick of the energy retail association told the bbc : " to see the sort of dramatic rises we 've had in wholesale prices over the last 12 months is quite incredible . "
centrica denied it had made a decision on how much it would increase prices , and other suppliers also said they had no intention of raising prices in the near future .
" clearly , all suppliers are buying their gas in the same market , therefore we would expect that suppliers will be increasing their tariffs substantially as we go through 2006 , " said a spokesman for centrica .
" but we have n't said anything about timing or scale of an increase . "
however , in december , centrica warned it was selling gas to its customers at a loss .
this is because wholesale price rises are not immediately passed on to domestic customers , so , when the price rise comes , it can seem unnecessarily steep .
patrick heron , chairman of heron energy , which monitors gas prices told the bbc : " when they eventually do move the price up they have to move it up sufficiently to cover their accumulated losses and their loss going forward for a period . "
supply problems to avoid a hike in prices , europe needs to open up its gas markets to greater competition , centrica said .
" with britain now dependent on gas imports from the continent , europe 's failure to open up its energy markets is costing uk customers dear , " said mark clare , managing director of british gas .
he went on to explain that russia 's recent decision to cut off gas to ukraine as it negotiated a new pricing contract - a move that impacted on supplies to europe - showed the problem was not limited to the uk .
greater freedom and access to the european gas pipelines could cut the cost of transporting gas across europe by up to £ 180m a year , centrica said .
in the meantime , industry experts predict that wholesale prices rise will last for another year at least .
" the very high wholesale prices are likely to continue for probably another 12 months , but after that they are likely to fall off a cliff , " said patrick heron .

patrick heron , chairman of heron energy , which monitors gas prices told the bbc : " when they eventually do move the price up they have to move it up sufficiently to cover their accumulated losses and their loss going forward for a period . "
supply problems to avoid a hike in prices , europe needs to open up its gas markets to greater competition , centrica said .
" with britain now dependent on gas imports from the continent , europe 's failure to open up its energy markets is costing uk customers dear , " said mark clare , managing director of british gas .
he went on to explain that russia 's recent decision to cut off gas to ukraine as it negotiated a new pricing contract - a move that impacted on supplies to europe - showed the problem was not limited to the uk .
greater freedom and access to the european gas pipelines could cut the cost of transporting gas across europe by up to £ 180m a year , centrica said .
in the meantime , industry experts predict that wholesale prices rise will last for another year at least .
" the very high wholesale prices are likely to continue for probably another 12 months , but after that they are likely to fall off a cliff , " said patrick heron .

centrica said a lack of competition had made it difficult to get enough gas to meet demand at peak times .
it added that the way gas contracts are currently structured - being linked to the price of oil - could cost european consumers as much as £ 40bn this year .
the report comes as politicians prepare to discuss the uk gas market on monday .
the parliamentary trade & industry select committee is scheduled to meet on monday to discuss the changing uk energy environment .
gas prices have become a worry for consumers and policymakers alike as the uk produces less from its fields and relies more on imports from europe .
europe 's failure to open up its energy markets is costing uk customers dear mark clare , managing director of british gas with supplies being squeezed , the cost of wholesale gas has increased by 70 % over the past 12 months and has trebled since 2003 .
greater freedom suppliers have warned that prices are likely to rise , and there have been suggestions in the media that the increase may be as much as 25 % .
this would make the average household bill about £ 1,000 a year .
duncan sedgewick of the energy retail association told the bbc : " to see the sort of dramatic rises we 've had in wholesale prices over the last 12 months is quite incredible . "
centrica denied it had made a decision on how much it would increase prices , and other suppliers also said they had no intention of raising prices in the near future .
" clearly , all suppliers are buying their gas in the same market , therefore we would expect that suppliers will be increasing their tariffs substantially as we go through 2006 , " said a spokesman for centrica .
" but we have n't said anything about timing or scale of an increase . "

money talk by tom mcphail head of pensions research , hargreaves lansdown tom mcphail , hargreaves lansdown make a note in your diary for 6 april 2006 - it could mark the turning point in the declining fortunes of the uk pension system .
it could even be the moment when pensions start to get interesting .
what is a-day ?
on that date , a new set of pension rules will be introduced .
they will replace much of the existing pension legislation which has been built up over previous decades .
this marks a crucial departure from past practice .
it is a genuine attempt to make the system simpler and more accessible to the millions of investors who have found pensions just too much of a headache to get to grips with .
the more that people can be encouraged to make their own savings out of income now , the easier the challenge will be for the government in the future .
what will it mean for us as individuals ?
many of the existing restrictions on how pensions can be used will be swept away .
from a-day , if you want to be a member of a company pension scheme and save money in a personal pension at the same time , then you can .
if you want to start drawing your pension and carrying on working , then that 's ok too .
new limits the limits on what you can put in and what you can take out have also been simplified .
you can invest up to 100 % of your earned income in any tax year , up to a ceiling of £ 215,000 - more than enough to keep most people happy , and receive tax relief at your highest marginal rate .
big changes for pensions you can invest up to 100 % of your earned income in any tax year , up to £ 215,000 you can build up a pension fund up to a lifetime limit , initially £ 1.5m you can draw your 25 % tax-free lump sum from your pension at the age of 55 you may no longer need to buy an annuity by your 75th birthday similarly , you can build up a pension fund up to a lifetime limit , initially £ 1.5m , before any tax restrictions kick in .
there are transition rules for people who may already be close to this lifetime limit .
further changes include being able to take 25 % of your contracted-out personal pension fund as a tax-free lump sum , as will also be the case for additional voluntary contribution -lrb- avc -rrb- pensions .
you will also have more choice over how your retirement income is paid .
you could , for example , draw your 25 % tax-free lump sum from your pension at the age of 55 and defer taking any retirement income until you actually retire , perhaps 10 years later .
this option is likely to be particularly popular for investors facing an endowment shortfall , or an impoverished child with aspirations towards a university education .
the requirement which forces investors to buy an annuity by their 75th birthday is also being partially abolished , although it looks as though any lump sum payouts on death after this age may become subject to inheritance tax .
so what does this all mean in practical terms ?
if , for example , you have an avc pension , then you may benefit from holding off your retirement until after a-day , so that you can take 25 % of your fund as a tax-free lump sum .
you will have more choice about when , how and how much you save into a pension also , new annuity options after a-day may also mean that you can find more suitable terms on which to have your retirement income paid .
after a-day , you will have more choice about when , how and how much you save into a pension .
so there 's a fair chance that whatever you are currently doing about providing for your retirement , you may benefit from reviewing your current arrangements in light of the new rules .
what about employers and workplace pensions ?
for employers , it 's a case of once more into the breach .
the new contribution and benefit limits mean that they will have to rewrite their scheme rules to accommodate these changes .
in some cases , it may mean having to negotiate new terms with high earning senior executives who may , for example , not want any further pension benefits if they will breach the lifetime limit .
employers will have to redraw their scheme booklets and notify their members of the changes .
the good news for them is that the government has given them until 2011 before they have to shift their schemes across to the new regime .
how much to pay in ?
the crucial issue is how much is being paid into a pension .
traditional final salary pension schemes have typical contribution rates , from staff and employer together , of around 16-20 % of salaries .
occupational money purchase schemes have contribution rates of around 12 % of salary , and personal pensions typically only have around 6 % of an investor 's income being paid into them .
taking the final salary pensions as a benchmark of how much we should be saving , it is clear that more needs to be done .
the government and the pensions industry is waiting with bated breath to see if the a-day reforms will mark a turning point in our retirement planning .

they will replace much of the existing pension legislation which has been built up over previous decades .
this marks a crucial departure from past practice .
it is a genuine attempt to make the system simpler and more accessible to the millions of investors who have found pensions just too much of a headache to get to grips with .
the more that people can be encouraged to make their own savings out of income now , the easier the challenge will be for the government in the future .
what will it mean for us as individuals ?
many of the existing restrictions on how pensions can be used will be swept away .
from a-day , if you want to be a member of a company pension scheme and save money in a personal pension at the same time , then you can .
if you want to start drawing your pension and carrying on working , then that 's ok too .
new limits the limits on what you can put in and what you can take out have also been simplified .
you can invest up to 100 % of your earned income in any tax year , up to a ceiling of £ 215,000 - more than enough to keep most people happy , and receive tax relief at your highest marginal rate .
big changes for pensions you can invest up to 100 % of your earned income in any tax year , up to £ 215,000 you can build up a pension fund up to a lifetime limit , initially £ 1.5m you can draw your 25 % tax-free lump sum from your pension at the age of 55 you may no longer need to buy an annuity by your 75th birthday similarly , you can build up a pension fund up to a lifetime limit , initially £ 1.5m , before any tax restrictions kick in .
there are transition rules for people who may already be close to this lifetime limit .
further changes include being able to take 25 % of your contracted-out personal pension fund as a tax-free lump sum , as will also be the case for additional voluntary contribution -lrb- avc -rrb- pensions .
you will also have more choice over how your retirement income is paid .
you could , for example , draw your 25 % tax-free lump sum from your pension at the age of 55 and defer taking any retirement income until you actually retire , perhaps 10 years later .
this option is likely to be particularly popular for investors facing an endowment shortfall , or an impoverished child with aspirations towards a university education .
the requirement which forces investors to buy an annuity by their 75th birthday is also being partially abolished , although it looks as though any lump sum payouts on death after this age may become subject to inheritance tax .
so what does this all mean in practical terms ?
if , for example , you have an avc pension , then you may benefit from holding off your retirement until after a-day , so that you can take 25 % of your fund as a tax-free lump sum .
you will have more choice about when , how and how much you save into a pension also , new annuity options after a-day may also mean that you can find more suitable terms on which to have your retirement income paid .
after a-day , you will have more choice about when , how and how much you save into a pension .
so there 's a fair chance that whatever you are currently doing about providing for your retirement , you may benefit from reviewing your current arrangements in light of the new rules .
what about employers and workplace pensions ?
for employers , it 's a case of once more into the breach .
the new contribution and benefit limits mean that they will have to rewrite their scheme rules to accommodate these changes .
in some cases , it may mean having to negotiate new terms with high earning senior executives who may , for example , not want any further pension benefits if they will breach the lifetime limit .
employers will have to redraw their scheme booklets and notify their members of the changes .
the good news for them is that the government has given them until 2011 before they have to shift their schemes across to the new regime .
how much to pay in ?
the crucial issue is how much is being paid into a pension .
traditional final salary pension schemes have typical contribution rates , from staff and employer together , of around 16-20 % of salaries .
occupational money purchase schemes have contribution rates of around 12 % of salary , and personal pensions typically only have around 6 % of an investor 's income being paid into them .
taking the final salary pensions as a benchmark of how much we should be saving , it is clear that more needs to be done .
the government and the pensions industry is waiting with bated breath to see if the a-day reforms will mark a turning point in our retirement planning .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- q & a : nuclear fusion reactor bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 6 february 2006 , 09:50 gmt q & a : nuclear fusion reactor a decision has finally been made to site the 10bn-euro -lrb- £ 6.6bn -rrb- iter nuclear fusion reactor at cadarache in france .
the announcement in june 2005 brought to an end months of argument between the project partners - the eu , the us , japan , russia , china and south korea .
india has since also joined the project .
what is iter -lrb- international thermonuclear experimental reactor -rrb- ?
iter is an experimental reactor that will attempt to reproduce on earth the nuclear reactions that power the sun and other stars .
it will consolidate all that has been learnt over many decades of study .
if it works , and the technologies are proven to be practical , the international community will then build a prototype commercial reactor , dubbed demo .
the final step would be to roll out fusion technology across the globe .
what exactly is fusion ?
fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them , as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations .
in the core of the sun , huge gravitational pressure allows this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million degrees celsius .
at the much lower pressure that is possible on earth , temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million degrees celsius .
no materials on earth could withstand direct contact with such heat .
to achieve fusion , therefore , scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas , or plasma , is held and squeezed inside an intense doughnut-shaped magnetic field .
what are the advantages of fusion ?
the best fuel for fusion comprises two types , or isotopes , of hydrogen : deuterium and tritium .
the former can be derived from water which is abundant and available everywhere .
the latter can be produced from lithium , which is plentiful in the earth 's crust .
unlike the burning of fossil fuels , fusion reactions produce no carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for warming the planet .
fusion scientists also say the system would be inherently safe because any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown .
will iter produce radioactive waste ?
yes .
the neutrons produced in fusion reactions will " activate " the materials used in the walls of iter 's plasma chamber .
but one of the project 's tasks will be to find the materials that best withstand this bombardment .
this could result in waste materials that are safe to handle in a relatively modest timescale -lrb- 50-100 years -rrb- , compared with the much longer lived radioactive waste -lrb- many thousands of years -rrb- produced as a direct result of splitting atoms in fission reactions .
it has been calculated that after 100 years of post-operation radioactive decay , iter will be left with about 6,000 tonnes of waste .
when packaged , this would be equivalent to a cube with about 10m edges .
how soon will iter be built ?
the 28 june meeting of the iter partners agreed to site the reactor at cadarache in southern france over rokkasho in northern japan .
further progress on technical issues is still required , and construction is expected to take at least a decade .
how much will iter cost ?
iter construction costs are estimated at 4.57 billion euros -lrb- at 2000 prices -rrb- , to be spread over about 10 years .
estimated total operating costs over the expected operational lifetime of about 20 years are of a similar order .
how will iter be financed ?
initially it was decided that the eu and france would contribute 50 % of the construction costs , the rest being shared by other partners .
because japan agreed to stand aside in favour of cadarache , it gets favourable terms .
japan will get to host a related materials research facility - of which half the construction costs will be shouldered by the eu .
its scientists will get a larger share of iter 's research posts .
the eu will now support a japanese official to become the director-general of the iter project ; and will also back japan to host the demo fusion reactor if , or when , it gets built .
why is the eu so keen to host the reactor ?
iter will require considerable investment from the partners , but the potential pay-offs are thought to be well worth it .
hosting the experimental reactor will put the eu at the front of the queue to take commercial advantage of fusion .
the project is expected to generate more than 10,000 jobs and the expertise developed on iter will allow europe to reap the benefits of spin-off technologies .
why is fusion energy seen to be so desirable ?
we can not rely on fossil fuels indefinitely .
firstly , supplies of oil , coal and gas are finite and will eventually run down .
secondly , the greenhouse gases produced through the burning of fossil fuels are a major driver of climate change , scientists believe .
however , demand for energy is also increasing .
in 1990 , about 75 % of the world 's population -lrb- those in the developing countries -rrb- were responsible for only 33 % of the world 's energy consumption .
by the year 2020 , that 75 % is likely to have risen to 85 % and the energy consumption to around 55 % .
thus , there will be greater competition for the fuel resources available .
some think fusion will provide a relatively safe , green alternative to fossil fuels ; enabling the production of vast amounts of energy from abundant sources .
when will the first commercial fusion reactor be built ?
not for a long time .
experimental fusion reactors like the joint european torus -lrb- jet -rrb- at culham in the uk currently use more energy than they release .
there are therefore many major scientific and engineering hurdles to overcome before the technology becomes commercially viable .
a commercial reactor is not expected before 2045 or 2050 - if at all .
indeed , there is no guarantee that iter will succeed .
the running joke is that fusion has been " just decades away " for several decades .
and many commentators , particularly those greens who have fought long campaigns against nuclear fission , are deeply suspicious of fusion .
they doubt iter will deliver and believe the money earmarked for the project would be better spent on renewables , such as wind , wave and solar , for which technical solutions already exist .

the announcement in june 2005 brought to an end months of argument between the project partners - the eu , the us , japan , russia , china and south korea .
india has since also joined the project .
iter will produce relatively clean energy what is iter -lrb- international thermonuclear experimental reactor -rrb- ?
iter is an experimental reactor that will attempt to reproduce on earth the nuclear reactions that power the sun and other stars .
it will consolidate all that has been learnt over many decades of study .
if it works , and the technologies are proven to be practical , the international community will then build a prototype commercial reactor , dubbed demo .
the final step would be to roll out fusion technology across the globe .
what exactly is fusion ?
fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them , as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations .
in the core of the sun , huge gravitational pressure allows this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million degrees celsius .
at the much lower pressure that is possible on earth , temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million degrees celsius .
no materials on earth could withstand direct contact with such heat .
to achieve fusion , therefore , scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas , or plasma , is held and squeezed inside an intense doughnut-shaped magnetic field .
what are the advantages of fusion ?
the best fuel for fusion comprises two types , or isotopes , of hydrogen : deuterium and tritium .
the former can be derived from water which is abundant and available everywhere .
the latter can be produced from lithium , which is plentiful in the earth 's crust .
unlike the burning of fossil fuels , fusion reactions produce no carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for warming the planet .
fusion scientists also say the system would be inherently safe because any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown .
will iter produce radioactive waste ?
yes .
the neutrons produced in fusion reactions will " activate " the materials used in the walls of iter 's plasma chamber .
but one of the project 's tasks will be to find the materials that best withstand this bombardment .
efforts to build " a star on earth " have been technically very challenging more details this could result in waste materials that are safe to handle in a relatively modest timescale -lrb- 50-100 years -rrb- , compared with the much longer lived radioactive waste -lrb- many thousands of years -rrb- produced as a direct result of splitting atoms in fission reactions .
it has been calculated that after 100 years of post-operation radioactive decay , iter will be left with about 6,000 tonnes of waste .
when packaged , this would be equivalent to a cube with about 10m edges .
how soon will iter be built ?
the 28 june meeting of the iter partners agreed to site the reactor at cadarache in southern france over rokkasho in northern japan .
further progress on technical issues is still required , and construction is expected to take at least a decade .
how much will iter cost ?
iter construction costs are estimated at 4.57 billion euros -lrb- at 2000 prices -rrb- , to be spread over about 10 years .
estimated total operating costs over the expected operational lifetime of about 20 years are of a similar order .
how will iter be financed ?
initially it was decided that the eu and france would contribute 50 % of the construction costs , the rest being shared by other partners .
because japan agreed to stand aside in favour of cadarache , it gets favourable terms .
japan will get to host a related materials research facility - of which half the construction costs will be shouldered by the eu .
its scientists will get a larger share of iter 's research posts .
the eu will now support a japanese official to become the director-general of the iter project ; and will also back japan to host the demo fusion reactor if , or when , it gets built .

aol and yahoo plan to charge fees of up to one cent -lrb- us -rrb- per message to those that sign up for the service .
paying the fees means that messages will not go through spam filters , are guaranteed to arrive and will bear a stamp of authenticity .
both aol and yahoo said they would start offering the service within the next few months .
cash call the optional charging plan is meant for those organisations that send a lot of e-mail and do not want their messages mistaken for spam .
organisations that do not want to sign up will be able to send mail the old-fashioned way .
the service is also intended to act as protection against so-called phishing gangs that send e-mail messages disguised to look like they come from legitimate organisations .
under the plan , senders of e-mail will be charged fees ranging from one-quarter of a cent up to one cent to get messages through to aol and yahoo users .
despite the low fees , the service is likely to generate huge amounts of money for aol and yahoo .
in return for the fee , aol and yahoo will not send the messages through spam traps and filters that typically strip out all images and weblinks in an e-mail .
net firms take these steps to shield people from unwanted pornographic pictures ; to remove specially crafted images that report back to spammers that an e-mail address is live ; and to take out booby-trapped weblinks that take people to phishing websites .
all the messages that are paid for will bear a stamp saying they are authentic .
aol and yahoo have signed up with tech firm goodmail systems , which will run the service on their behalf .
the service is intended to tackle spam by making it expensive to send messages .
currently so many e-mail messages can be sent for free that tiny response rates mean spammers can easily make money .
the idea of charging for e-mail is just one of many methods used to tackle spam .
yahoo has also signed up for a system which only accepts e-mail from net sites it knows are legitimate senders of mail .
this is intended to tackle those spammers , up to 70 % according to some estimates , that use hijacked home pcs to route their e-mail messages .

aol and yahoo plan to charge fees of up to one cent -lrb- us -rrb- per message to those that sign up for the service .
paying the fees means that messages will not go through spam filters , are guaranteed to arrive and will bear a stamp of authenticity .
both aol and yahoo said they would start offering the service within the next few months .
cash call the optional charging plan is meant for those organisations that send a lot of e-mail and do not want their messages mistaken for spam .
organisations that do not want to sign up will be able to send mail the old-fashioned way .
the service is also intended to act as protection against so-called phishing gangs that send e-mail messages disguised to look like they come from legitimate organisations .
under the plan , senders of e-mail will be charged fees ranging from one-quarter of a cent up to one cent to get messages through to aol and yahoo users .
despite the low fees , the service is likely to generate huge amounts of money for aol and yahoo .
in return for the fee , aol and yahoo will not send the messages through spam traps and filters that typically strip out all images and weblinks in an e-mail .
net firms take these steps to shield people from unwanted pornographic pictures ; to remove specially crafted images that report back to spammers that an e-mail address is live ; and to take out booby-trapped weblinks that take people to phishing websites .
all the messages that are paid for will bear a stamp saying they are authentic .
aol and yahoo have signed up with tech firm goodmail systems , which will run the service on their behalf .
the service is intended to tackle spam by making it expensive to send messages .
currently so many e-mail messages can be sent for free that tiny response rates mean spammers can easily make money .
the idea of charging for e-mail is just one of many methods used to tackle spam .
yahoo has also signed up for a system which only accepts e-mail from net sites it knows are legitimate senders of mail .
